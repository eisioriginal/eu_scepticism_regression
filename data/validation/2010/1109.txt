 Mr President, there is a principle in English civil law called ‘to one who is willing, no harm is done’. In other words, you cannot sue if you put yourself in danger of loss or injury. These illegal immigrants were not kidnapped in their own countries by wicked Europeans who then brought them to Europe and incarcerated them for eighteen months or more. They chose to enter an EU country illegally and then avoided being repatriated. Presumably they are free to return to their countries of origin, but refuse to do so. We have heard that illegal immigrants – those who do not leave – are usually given a piece of paper ordering them to leave, in order to avoid them disappearing. If their stay is a long one it is usually because of extensive court actions to avoid repatriation. While talking about a breach of the Returns Directive, we learned in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on 31 March that in 2012 only 37% of those given a return decision eventually left. The other 63% remained. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, we are hearing the 1914 language of self-righteous indignation to imply that one side is completely in the right and the others completely in the wrong. We might not like Mr Yanukovych – and there is much about him I do not like, if it is true – but his removal as President did not fall within the categories in Article 108 of the Constitution of Ukraine, and the procedure for impeachment in Article 111 was not followed. The civil disturbances in Ukraine were orchestrated from the EU when Yanukovych rejected the EU trade agreement. This was just as much interference in Ukraine, and with less justification, than anything that Russia has done. The taped conversation of Victoria Nuland and Geoffrey Pyatt about who should lead Ukraine was evidence of blatant US interference. It is all very well to call a referendum held by the Crimean Autonomous Republic illegal, but this was no more illegal than the removal of Mr[nbsp ]Yanukovych. Crimea had traditionally been part of Russia since the 18th Century, until 1954 when it was handed over by Mr Khrushchev, a Soviet leader of Ukrainian descent. The recent referendum was hurried and insufficiently debated, but the result was hardly ambiguous. Large powers, like Russia and the United States, have what they see as legitimate spheres of interest. The United States was not going to allow Soviet missiles in Cuba in 1962. Russia was not prepared to accept with equanimity a member of the EU and NATO within its traditional borders.

 I found it difficult to find a question within what Mr[nbsp ]Posselt said, but I have never defended everything that Mr[nbsp ]Putin has done or said.

 Mr President, ‘own resources’ is a rather misleading euphemism. The EU has only the resources of its Member States, so their populations pay taxes perhaps more directly to the EU instead of through the treasuries of Member States. One of the purposes might be to disguise which countries are net contributors and which are net recipients, thus obviating the necessity for rebates and correction mechanisms and replacing them by a series of lump-sum payments over the next six years. You also remove from potentially rebellious Member States the power to threaten to withhold contributions from the EU. There is also a symbolic – or perhaps a psychological – significance of people paying taxes directly to the EU. It sends a subliminal message to taxpayers that the EU has the status of a state. How will own resources be enforced? By using officials and judges employed by Member States? Or perhaps new EU tax officials and courts will emerge, as though from nowhere.

 Mr President, the 2012 report of RAPEX reported that there had been a 26% increase in the number of alerts for dangerous products. This was not just the result of greater market surveillance, as the rapporteur said; the number of dangerous products really was increasing. Do we know the countries from which these products come? There have been some coded hints this morning, but only coded ones. On 20[nbsp ]January, we learnt from a debate on a proposed regulation for consumer protection that 58% of notifications for dangerous products related to goods from China, and that in a further 16% of cases it was not possible to identify the country of origin. Importation of cheap goods from emergent economies does not only undermine our manufacturing basis (and of course the jobs of our workers), it also has the potential for injuring our consumers. Freedom of movement of goods – not just within the EU, but globally – is the root cause of dangerous products in our markets. The EU is not so much a European Union, as it is becoming a global union.

 Madam President, EU legislation, unlike trade, does not extend beyond its borders, so it might not answer all the animal health needs of animals originating in third countries. This regulation would replace complex existing legislation and much of its substantive content would certainly be beneficial. Healthy farm animals are recognised as a prerequisite of human health. Whilst the rapporteur acknowledges that this is not primarily an animal protection law, she quotes with approval the description in a parallel regulation that animals are sentient beings and has written that the legislation protecting live animals when travelling should be amended to reflect distances travelled rather than just borders crossed. Sentient beings can feel pain and suffer from discomfort and fear. Ritualistic slaughter of animals without pre-stunning is self-evidently cruel treatment of a sentient being. Food from such an animal will not of course be a hazard to human health, but it will be a wound to civilised sensibilities. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, the nature-nurture debate used to be the most important in politics and was the key to a whole range of political views. The nurture side had much to be said for it – perceived kindness and fairness and, of course, non-discrimination. The nature side had only evidence to support it.  However, nurture now seems to have been declared the winner without a contest. Indeed, nature has been airbrushed out of the picture, even as a contestant. All public policies, whether devised by left, right, centrist or a populist safety valve, base their policies on a false assumption. They assume equal potential ability, which does no favours to those without it. They assume third world migrants can be substitute Europeans, when they only turn Europe into the third world. They confuse social mobility with equality of opportunity and do not realise that the latter will eventually bring the former to a shuddering halt. They throw money at continents that cannot benefit from it, because Europe takes their brightest and best. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, the External Action Service seeks to develop a common policy and only then persuade or cajole Member States to adhere to it. I am in favour of joint action, but only when it is necessary. This must be based on prior agreement on objectives and a genuine commonality of interests, not a shared desire for aggressive adventurism.  Paragraph[nbsp ]25 states that there is a strong link between development and conflict prevention. European States should therefore stop fomenting conflict in other countries that can cause devastating recession and dire poverty. Of course, the greatest reason for stagnation in the poorest of countries is a dearth of talent. This is made worse by northern countries looting what talent they have, generation after generation. We must reverse the brain drain and encourage their brightest and best to reinvest their abilities in the countries of their birth or descent. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, I am not an admirer of the Iranian Islamic Republic, but there are many repressive countries in the world and some of them are the West’s allies. Iran has been involved in only one war in recent decades, with Iraq. It is widely accepted that Iraq was the instigator of that conflict. I am afraid I cannot judge whether Iran has only a civil nuclear programme, but the claims about Iraq proved to be unfounded.  There is a certain irony in the fact that many of Iran’s critics, the United States and Israel among them, have been involved in conflicts in the past and have nuclear weapons. I am sceptical about the foreign policy priorities of the United States, though I must say the present administration is showing more restraint than its republican predecessor. I am no supporter of the European External Action Service or of the position of High Representative. However, if an agreement between the United States and Iran, encouraged by Baroness Ashton, prevents conflict and normalises relations it, and she, must be applauded. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, to find out what a meeting is about, it is sometimes necessary to put together different sources as though they were pieces in an intricate jigsaw. The agenda of the forthcoming meeting refers to the European Semester which, among other things, includes inspection by the Commission of reform programmes, including reforms of the labour market. The agenda also mentions industrial competitiveness and the importance of a strong and competitive industrial base as a driver for economic growth and jobs. If we refer back to a meeting of ECOFIN, held on 16[nbsp ]February[nbsp ]2012, about the European Semester of that year, we find that ‘reforms need to focus on labour markets – in particular wage-setting mechanisms – to ensure efficient adjustment of labour costs’. What does all this mean? It means that a relatively high-wage economy, or group of economies, embracing the ideology of globalism and the process of globalisation, must drive down wages to compete with the emergent economies.

 Mr President, the present crisis in Ukraine did not start with a Russian invasion. It started with the EU’s reaction to Ukraine’s rejection of the EU-Ukrainian trade deal. This reaction took the form of the EU’s friends in that country exploiting Ukrainian nationalists to provide paramilitary assistance on the streets. I am no supporter of Mr Yanukovych, of his political or personal background or his tactics against demonstrators. However, the Ukrainian Parliament does not have the power simply to remove the president under Article 108, and it does not appear that the impeachment procedures under Article 111 were followed. The EU is determined to ensnare Ukraine by bribery and intimidation. I certainly do not view the presence of Russian troops in the Ukraine with equanimity; I would like them to withdraw. However, Russia is reacting to extreme acts of provocation, not just by the EU but also the US. We know this … (The President cut off the speaker) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, Mr Cercas’s report explains succinctly the formula being applied to the countries investigated: wage freezes and cuts, cuts in welfare spending, part-time and temporary work, and involuntary emigration. It then leaps to three laudable objectives: increased employment, reduction in poverty and reduction in school drop-out rates. It quite rightly calls for an end to austerity. You do not make people richer or reduce their indebtedness by making them poorer. However, its other recommendations lack substance or definition and amount to a prayer for things to improve. It shies away from the root cause: the fact that the euro’s value is too high for their economies. Only withdrawal from the eurozone and a reintroduction of their national currencies, which will fall in value, will allow them to enjoy export-led expansions. The austerity programmes were designed to save the eurozone; they were not designed to help the four countries concerned. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, I am not an EU enthusiast at all, and I can see even less justification for the EU to facilitate investment in countries beyond its borders. In the case of countries in Eastern Europe, I suppose it can be seen as a bribe to lure them into becoming candidate countries and surrendering their sovereignty. North African countries, of course, are not eligible to be members, at least under present rules, but their receipt of investment is a sign that the EU is not so much a European Union as a global union in waiting. There will undoubtedly be people in the still-crisis-ridden states of the South who wonder why all such available money is not being invested there. The answer might be that investment will be less effective in those countries when expansion is constrained by a currency that is overvalued for their economies. Indeed, withdrawal from the eurozone for those countries would be a prerequisite for effective investment. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, the existence of the EIB is justified on the grounds of perceived need. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) bemoans the fact that there was a lack of sustainable and viable projects that were eligible for EIB funding. It appears that the EIB criteria did not match the investment need. There is certainly a need for investment in infrastructure in the Member States. However, investment can be carried out more cheaply, more efficiently and in a more targeted way by those Member States creating the credit themselves rather than borrowing from external institutions and adding sovereign debt. The principle of ‘what is physically possible must be financially possible’ should be followed. President Obama, no less, when introducing the American Jobs Act, said it was a contradiction for a bridge in Maine to be in need of repair while construction workers were unemployed. However, the resolution of that contradiction seems to have eluded him. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, the explanatory memorandum in Ms[nbsp ]Zuberʼs report says that the effects of austerity in Greece, Ireland, Portugal and elsewhere are that women are suffering disproportionately, but of course all workers are suffering from those measures, not just women. The urgent need is to end the austerity programmes she refers to, and membership of the euro area which is the thing that they are supposed to sustain. When those countries benefit from an export-led expansion following withdrawal from the euro area, there will indeed be prosperity to be divided fairly between men and women, which must happen. To seek to divide austerity fairly is to exonerate its architects from responsibility and distract attention from the cause of their suffering. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, in my first debate in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) five years ago, a noblewoman of Liberal persuasion convinced herself that I did not know the difference between people travelling with or without a visa, on the one hand, and immigrants on the other. I think that I remarked that I did know the difference but sometimes the travellers did not.  People who travel from poor countries to relatively rich ones are not always scrupulously honest about their purposes for, or the intended length of, their visit. In a recent debate in LIBE, a representative of the Commission warned against confusing visa facilitation and visa liberalisation and said that easing the procedure for obtaining the visa, as distinct from waiving it, would not allow the visa holder to overstay. The visa overstayer, he implied, would be waiting in the place he was supposed to have been for the authorities to collect him and return him to his own country.  I have heard the Commission accused of many things but I did not think that naivety was among them. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, in the eyes of the EU all rights are equal but some are more equal than others. In any democracy the political rights – freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and electoral rights – should be pre-eminent. Why? Because they are the key to all the others: their recognition, their extent and their limitations. Indeed many of the personal rights were established only with the exercise of these political rights. However, the EU regards the personal rights – chosen or determined behaviour, freedom from constraint, prohibition of discrimination, freedom of movement – to be paramount. If there should be a conflict between, say, freedom of expression and one of these personal rights, freedom of expression would be the loser. What they are really saying is that the political rights were simply vehicles for campaigning for their range of personal rights. Once these have been elevated to the status of having self-evident virtue, the political rights have served their use and have become redundant. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, this report starts innocently enough by referring to conditions of entry for ostensibly short-term visitors, such as exchange pupils or au[nbsp ]pairs. Then the pretences are cast aside and it admits that it is just a prelude to large-scale permanent immigration, eleven million in the current decade. Why? The pretext is Europe’s ageing population caused, in part, by women’s enslavement to economic forces and subservience to anti-family propaganda. The report envisages ‘third-country’, for which you can often read Third World, immigrants with their large families becoming replacement Europeans. Well, they won’t. They will continue to turn more and more parts of Europe into the Third World. You cannot change a person’s identity by changing his or her country or continent of residence. Furthermore, you do not help poorer countries by robbing them of their most skilled and able workers.

... long list of occupations here, they are not just students and researchers, but in fact the following paragraph mentions quite separately that Europe today has an ageing population and needs immigration.

 Madam President, when the history of the 21st century is written it could be remembered as the one in which Europeans were ethnically cleansed from large parts of their homelands. Within my lifetime large parts of the cities of many countries in the West have been transformed into outposts of Africa and Asia. By the end of the century the East will probably be transformed in the same way.  Now it has not happened autonomously like the wind and tides; it has been brought about deliberately by the people who misrule us: the political class. When the peoples of Europe are no longer the pre-eminent populations our distinctive culture will be no more. Distinctive peoples are not the product of distinctive cultures; distinctive cultures are the product of distinctive peoples. Demographic change is not just about numbers and space. It is about the identities of the peoples doing the replacing and the people being replaced. There is still time for Europeans nationally, and in cooperation, to alter their destiny and take control of their own future. It will require moral courage, determination and resolution.

 Mr President, if you start with the premise that admitting seasonal workers was an economic necessity and would happen anyway, there might be something to be said for at least part of this report. The conditions of work of the seasonal workers in Rosarno, where we went in 2010, were truly appalling. Allowing those sorts of conditions, wages and accommodation to be tolerated would be inhumane and would encourage employers to hire third-country workers before home or EU workers. However, allowing third-country workers to apply from within the EU for seasonal work would reward illegal migrants and encourage the entry of more. Allowing people admitted for another purpose to apply would invite abuse of the admission system.  Nine to twelve months is more than a season. I should like to see the evidence for the conclusion that national and other EU workers would be unwilling to take seasonal work. Many long-term unemployed would be pleased to have paid work with accommodation provided in their own country, or at least in their own continent. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, the ethnic and religious conflict is obviously the most pressing problem, but in a way it distracts us from the underlying long-term problems of poverty, a lack of economic development and a fragile civic infrastructure. We must understand the nature of these problems if they are to be solved.  Now these problems are not just the product of the decades following independence or, for that matter, of the colonial experience. Despite being rich in natural resources and having favourable agricultural conditions, the CAR is one of the world’s poorest countries. We might ask why the area of the Central African Republic, and the rest of sub-Saharan Africa for that matter, did not develop the instruments of technology and transport and use them to spread the fruits of their discoveries, learning and creativity throughout the world in the way that Europe did. If there has been, and continues to be, a hindrance to development it must be identified and addressed. When we address that question honestly we might be ready to start solving Africa’s problems.

 Mr President, insider dealing and market manipulation are undoubtedly wrong and harm countless numbers of people. They are not victimless crimes and should be subject to criminal sanctions. The argument is that when a market becomes international, the regulation must also become international. From that it is concluded that EU legislation is called for – surprise, surprise. There is a slight flaw in the logic or at least in one of the premises. The terms EU and international are not synonymous. What is required is an international treaty, signed by all significant trading countries, to the effect that the signatory countries will legislate for stated minimum standards of legislation. In this example, as in many others, EU harmonising legislation is the objective and the prevention of insider dealer and market manipulation is simply the pretext. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, if you start from a position of 28 countries locked into the EU, and all of them locked into the global trade system governed by the World Trade Organisation, you might be forgiven for thinking that there was some merit in the Commission’s proposal, for example, to modify the lesser duty rule, or to impose provisional duties after establishing proof of what even the EU would consider to be dumping. However, I am tempted to take the part of the man in the joke who, when asked for directions, replied: ‘I would not have started from here.’  I am opposed to EU controls over my country’s ability to manage its own trade. However, I am even more concerned about the EU and the WTO facilitating trade with low-wage economies with whose manufactured goods we cannot possibly compete, and which constitute dumping, without any investigation being necessary.

 Mr President, for a tax to attract one or two non-partisan critics would be unfortunate. To attract dozens sounds a bit like carelessness. The tax is superficially appealing as a levy on institutions blamed for the recession: a tax on the rich to benefit the poor. But, as one critic said: banks simply pass down their taxes to us, the customers. Indeed, the FTT would be levied most heavily on long-term investments such as those of pension funds. The good news is that it will be levied in only eleven countries. The bad news is that it might be drafted in a way that would catch some transactions in countries that have rejected it.  There is reason to believe that its imposition, even at a modest level, would lead to the migration of funds to countries beyond those participating in it. If it were ever to be imposed on all 28 Member States, funds would migrate to New York and elsewhere. Remember: the FTT is the chosen instrument to be an EU own-resources tax.

 Mr President, I am not in favour of freedom of movement, in principle: sovereign states should be able to admit, or refuse to admit, whom they wish. When it applies between countries with widely different wage levels, it leaves the source country devoid of valuable labour and the destination country with home workers jobless.  But the problem is aggravated when third-country citizens abuse the procedure by gaining access using forged and stolen documents, sham marriages and even proxy marriages. We are told that the procedure for authenticating documents is time-consuming and troublesome. It needs to be. The British Home Secretary submitted a document showing the extent of the fraud to the Commission in December, but it is yet to be revealed to the public. The report sees freedom of movement to be not just a right, but an expectation. Those promoting it are trying to eradicate national identity and, by encouraging third-party or third-country nationals, they are seeking to eradicate the identity of Europe too.

 Madam President, the cause of homelessness, which is unmentionable by the silent conspiracy of liberal consensus, is immigration and asylum. Every person or family entering a country adds to the demand for housing by one. If there are homeless among the indigenous population, a house provided for a new arrival is a house denied to an existing resident. The decision-takers – MEPs, MPs, local councillors – are not among the homeless. Indeed, most of them cannot count any homeless among their circle of acquaintances. To them, the homeless are just statistics and not real people. Decision-takers feel terribly generous for granting a home to a newcomer, but funnily enough they do not feel mean for denying one to an existing resident. We heard this morning from UKIP that it was opposed to mass immigration. However, its leader said recently ‘we want immigration, we welcome immigration’.

Mr President, the Lithuanian Presidency claims credit for progress on the Banking Union and enhanced EU control over the economies of Member States, especially those in the eurozone, as though these were simply means of achieving economic well-being. However, these are not a means to an end, but rather an end in itself: centralised control of Member States. The Presidency has boasted of its achievements on hate crime, which properly refers to criminal acts, violence, abuse and property damage motivated by hatred of a particular category of people, and should always be deplored. Hatred is always destructive of the hater as well as the hated. However, assaults and extreme violence and damage motivated by hatred and contempt are not perpetrated only – or even mainly – by the indigenous populations of Europe against ethnic minorities, as we know from the cases of Lee Rigby in London, those of Kriss Donald and Richard Everitt, the London riots in 2011 and the countless victims of Asian grooming. Lithuania boasts of hosting a conference in November of the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), which believes in the criminalisation of disapproved expressions of opinion on ethnicity, including racism – a word undefined but coined by Trotsky – and xenophobia, which can only be described as an Orwellian thought crime. Ironically, the application of these words to political opponents – a favourite activity of the FRA and Eurocrats – is a subliminal message of hatred: stop reading, stop listening, stop judging for yourself; hate the speaker, hate the writer.

 Mr President, given that national legislation is insufficient, this proposal is ostensibly to protect consumers. Yet the more you read, the more you realise that consumer protection is not wanted primarily for its own sake but because it will facilitate free trade. It seems that cutting the budget would not be acceptable. No surprise there! In the context of product safety, the report does contain some interesting revelations. In 2010, 58 % of notifications were in respect of goods from China, and in 16 % of cases it was not possible to identify the country of the manufacturer. Alarmingly, 25 % of notifications concerned toys. The drive to extend free trade worldwide without regard for the job security of Europeans is well documented. However, it seems that consumer safety has also been a victim of international free trade. The countries of Europe, individually or collectively, cannot deal with countries that habitually sell us unsafe or substandard goods. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, I am not reassured that this proposal is not protectionist, because that is exactly what it ought to be. The countries of Europe, individually or collectively, ought to protect their jobs and their businesses. The question which has not been asked is whether it is in the interests of any country or trading bloc, if you will, to open its public procurement market to other countries or blocs. Public expenditure is ultimately funded by domestic taxes, but if it generates economic activity – and it does – it should be for the benefit of that country or those countries’ own peoples. The report confirms that market access by companies from third countries is part of the common commercial policy which falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The EU’s wish to maximise international access to these markets shows that the EU is not so much a European Union as a global union in waiting. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, yes, the Commission wants to see more single market competition for defence procurement on the ground that fragmented markets create red tape and duplication of defence programmes. It is not fragmentation that leads to red tape; it is the EU requirement that defence contracts should be put out to tender.  Britain could, of course ironically, use the Lisbon Treaty to avoid tendering on the ground of protecting its national interest, as Poland has done to its great credit. The Commission will tackle what it calls market distortions, which will probably take away the rights of Member States to protect their national interest in this area. Defence is too important to the national interest to allow free market competition.  Whilst another European war is, we all hope, unthinkable, our world interests might diverge; the UK cannot be dependent for equipment procurement on states opposed, say, to our protecting the Falklands from Argentinian aggression.

Mr President, in paragraph 13 the rapporteurs express their dislike of Member States excluding themselves from treaties or legislation from the outset, and would prefer legislation to allow for derogations later. This effectively makes the default position that all treaties and legislation should apply to all Member States unless they negotiate an opt-out and only, of course, for as long as they retain it. However, the express disapproval of derogations is intended to make them an exceptional and shameful procedure for which Member States should feel properly contrite. This means that agreements and legislation concerning the euro and instruments to serve it will apply to Britain and other non-euro countries unless they and Britain ask for a derogation: in other words, control of our economy unless the government asks for an opt-out. This would allow Member State governments that are indolent, or perhaps less eurosceptic than they pretend to be, to extend the EU’s control…  (The President cut off the speaker) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, it is tempting to applaud the proposals for increasing the power of Parliament and increasing the accountability of the President of the European Council to it. Equally, it is easy to deprecate the behaviour of the European Council in trying to extend its role. If I were an enthusiast for the EU project, I would succumb to both temptations. However, I am not so I shall not. Do I look at the European Council through rose-tinted spectacles? No. My view of some of their members might involve unparliamentary language. However, whatever I think of particular members of the European Council, its members represent Member States and are ultimately responsible to their electorates and removable by them. The Parliament, whatever its merits, is not responsible to a single electorate with a consciousness of its identity so it cannot take a conscious collective decision as to the choice of Commission President. Indeed its decision will look like the decision of a Ouija board. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the general objective of the programme is to develop further mutual recognition by promoting judicial cooperation in criminal and civil matters. It all sounds rather splendid until, of course, the difficulties are examined. There are enormous differences in substantive law and trial procedure between Member States, and even within them. However, there are also differences in legal culture between the common law and continental systems, with particular reference to freedoms to act. The starting presumption in common law is that persons have the freedom to do whatever is not prohibited by law. The starting position in many continental countries is that rights are created by proclamation and can be easily defined. Whilst even in common law systems they can be defined negatively and repressively, the jury system is a safeguard against legislation and prosecutions that are considered to be unreasonable. We can see how this difference manifests itself in practice: many continental countries restrict freedom of expression in an extreme, obsessive and quite insane way. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, we have the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide but toleration of political repression at home in the EU, selective registration of European parties, party bans and attempted bans on fabricated evidence, the arrest of opposition MPs on trumped-up charges, prosecution meaning even imprisonment for heretical opinion, and even thought crime. Can democracy and human rights be implanted and nurtured even in unpromising soil? It is difficult to prevent it from being corrupted and undermined even in its ancestral home.  Countries with strong vertical divisions have difficulty in making it work. In countries with inflexible and intolerant religious ideologies, democracy can bring social repression for women and religious minorities. It is often thought that social liberalism and observance of human rights complement democracy. However, sometimes politically repressive regimes are socially liberal. There are indispensable social preconditions for democracy to develop and survive but they cannot be bought and paid for from outside. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the long-term prospects for British fishermen depend on withdrawal from the EU, but of course fishermen want solutions to current and immediate problems. We are told that the discard policy involving fish that cannot survive will of course be discontinued, but the survivability rate is said to be higher with some species. There must be research-led distinctions between treatment of different species. Avoidance of by-catch waste is a welcome theme of the Stevenson report, with adult commercial fish to be allowed onto the open market and the remaining by-catch being used for some other commercial purpose: fish meal, pet food, etc. In the end, by-catches must be reduced, possibly with gear that distinguishes between different sizes for selective catch and release, such as the pot-trap developed by my constituent Mr Jeff Stockdale in 2009. Information to consumers is always to be welcomed but the original requirements for gear type, fish stock and flag state might have been excessively costly.

Mr President, some in my country would say that Britain in the EU is not British enough, and they would be right. But I would say that the European Union is not European enough. The immigration policies of Western Member States and the embryonic EU policy have brought third world populations to Europe and have turned parts of Europe into the third world. Identities are the product of ancestry and history, not of culture or legal contrivance. The EU does not have a European economic protectionist policy. It has a globalist policy designed to move by gradual degrees to a world economy with a common wage level and standard of living. There are genuine Europhiles, but the Eurocrats are not among them. They are cosmopolitans. Ironically, the main media-created, pretend Eurosceptic party in the UK is in favour of a quarter of a million immigrants each year and embraces globalism and global free trade. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, agriculture is unlike any other industry because of the inelasticity of its demand and supply. That makes public-sector support absolutely indispensable. But that support ought to be Member State support and not EU support. The UK receives the smallest share of common agricultural policy funding of any Member State. The EU’s embrace of neo-liberalism opens the door to trade agreements that force Europe’s farmers to face dangerous competition. That same philosophy allows supermarkets to treat farmers as though they were their own outworkers. The multitude of farmers face the tyranny of few buyers, which is a classic example of what an economist would call an oligopsony. We have been warned about a re-nationalisation of agricultural policy. If only that were the case! What we need is abolition of the CAP, not its reform. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, money by itself does not produce intellectual inspiration. That is to be found in what a Commission 2020 document described as a ‘talented and creative populationʼ. That is Europeans, if you were wondering. Indeed, a disproportionately large number of inventions and innovations come from Europe in general, and from a country that modesty prevents me from mentioning in particular. Perhaps ensuring the survival of those talented populations from the replacement from which they are now suffering would be the best way of encouraging and nurturing inventiveness. There are some other populations in the world that have been most cruelly deprived of their fair share of those gifts. Does the public sector, preferably at Member State level, have a role to play? Historically, neither inventions nor innovations receive public funds. However, subsidies are contagious and countries and trading blocs that need to compete must match the subsidies of their rivals. Will research and development ensure that we can compete? Not if the wage levels of competitors are a fraction of our own, or if the elite talent of our competitors is to copy our innovations in breach of patent rights. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the report on the interinstitutional agreement is highly critical of the length of the negotiations within the Council and between the institutions. But the money that is the subject of negotiation is taxpayers’ money, and its expenditure must be given due consideration. The rapporteur is keen that Parliament’s legislative and budgetary powers granted by the Treaty of Lisbon should be fully respected. The report is critical of the Council for binding itself to the conclusions of the European Council.  It is true that Parliament is the only directly elected body and it seems at first sight right that it should be pre-eminent in the budgetary process. However, most of the money spent by the EU comes from or through Member States, and Member States’ governments are, in the eyes of their electorates, held responsible to their electorates for their taxpayers’ money. Parliament might be constitutionally responsible to a theoretical European electorate, but that electorate is not conscious even of its own existence as an entity. There is little dialogue between MEPs and their electors about the precise allocation of funds as distinct from the total amount.  The European Council – unlike the Council – does not have an official legislative role, but as the body representing Heads of Government its members are much more aware of the views of their citizens on expenditure than are MEPs. For as long as the EU continues they must have an important say in the negotiating process. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, this agenda is a distraction from the real causes of unemployment and the lack of growth. They include restrictive budgetary policies, cheap foreign imports from emergent economies, domestic earned income being invested abroad, and the outsourcing of jobs. But the cause of unemployment which is the real taboo is immigration, especially immigration from the Third World. Their migrants are assisted by anti-discrimination laws, while what we really need are native population preference laws, so that each country’s nationals could go to the top of the employment list. Immigration should be on the agenda as one of the causes of unemployment. In the UK, we have an establishment safety-valve party that would pretend to be opposed to mass immigration, but on 4 May 2010, its leader, Mr Farage, said that the UK should issue a quarter of a million work permits each year.

Mr President, I am sure that the High Representative will be believed when she says she wants to promote democracy and the rule of law throughout the world. I am not an enthusiast for her position, but she rightly challenges and criticises countries that imprison opposition leaders on spurious or doubtful pretexts. Of course, this does not just take place in former Soviet Republics or unstable regimes of the Middle East or Africa; it can also happen in Member States. Only a few weeks ago we saw several MP’s of Greece’s third-strongest party arrested and detained on a ‘sovietesque’ charge of founding a criminal organisation. They are not, apparently, charged with complicity in the despicable murder of a left-wing activist, but their party has been transformed into a criminal organisation over night. I know nothing directly about Golden Dawn, and I certainly do not look at them through rose-tinted spectacles. But the rule of law cannot be observed selectively. We cannot pre-judge governments and opposition (…) (the speaker was cut off by the President) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, if the EU needs to know whether the single market has been a success, it need only look at organised crime. The removal of international borders and visa-free travel make detection much less likely. The creation of a single currency could have been invented by money launderers – possibly it was. Of course, money laundering is not always obviously a cross-border activity. The UK is full of micro and small businesses which deal with cash customers and survive only by divine providence. Indeed, the hand of God – or at least one of his alternatives – must be responsible, because the tiny number of customers they have could not sustain them. The products that they sell in limited quantities are varieties of fast food and taxi rides. The trafficked products and people that they sell on a grander and more profitable scale are the products and services that dare not speak their name. Organised crime is a real problem, and this report has some merit. But it is being used to justify yet more EU centralisation and control, more harmonisation and, of course, use of the EU’s public prosecutor’s office. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, the rapporteur protests in this document that there is no protectionist aim whatsoever, as though the word ‘protectionist’ might be one of those hate labels – like ‘racist’ – that are so popular with cosmopolitans. The rapporteur is using the word ‘protectionist’ in its strict economic sense, referring to tariff and non-tariff barriers to international trade. However, if he had been using it in a more general and everyday sense, his denial would be equally valid. The EU is emphatically not trying to protect Europe’s interests, still less the interests of its Member States. The objective is to follow the World Trade Organisation’s globalist agenda. Retaliation would not be used to protect Europe’s economic interests but to enforce observance of the WTO’s globalist rules. The theory of international trade is that unrestricted trade makes the world as a whole richer. However, even if that were always the case, it would not follow that it made everybody or every country richer too. The free movement of goods and services, capital and labour – which is of course what all globalists, including EU globalists, are driving for – can only work if prices and wages are on undifferentiated scales. If that happens, the developed world, including Europe, has everything to lose. The third world and emergent economies have everything to gain.

Mr President, we have heard from the Commissioner that there ought to be respect for the rule of law in Russia, that people should not be condemned without a distinct breach of the law established by the ordinary courts. But we heard only yesterday from the Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, no less, that people accused of an undoubtedly horrific murder in Greece could be regarded as guilty before any trial. Even people perceived as being beyond the pale must be treated with respect for the rule of law.  Before we point the finger at Russia, Members of this Parliament should look into their own conduct. We have heard that Russia is restricting freedom of expression. If it is, that will be reprehensible. However, many EU Member States lock people up for expressing opinions that do not have any hint of violence. Indeed, Commissioner Reding would like to go further and criminalise thought crime. I am sure that many Members here have been speaking honesty and from the heart, but I believe that behind this debate is an agenda that has got very little to do with sexuality or freedom of expression: it is about Russia’s foreign policy.

Madam President, the loss of life among illegal migrants in the Mediterranean is of course an appalling tragedy. Improving the rapidity of response to accidents is necessary, but of course is only part of the solution. The main answer is to remove the incentive for them to travel to Europe. We must replace the policy of allowing most of these people to stay with a policy of allowing none of them to stay. When that message gets through to would-be migrants, they will stop taking the risk. Repatriation of illegals really will save lives. The architects of the EU asylum policies, including people in this House, are directly and personally responsible for deaths in the Mediterranean. They should really hang their heads in shame. The logical extension of non-refoulement is a recipe for allowing all Third World illegal migrants to stay. Of course, the real unspoken migratory policy of the EU is to cleanse ethnically the indigenous populations of Europe and replace them with people from the Third World. When that happens, parts of Europe become outposts of the Third World. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, investment, in its simplest form, is the deferral of present consumption in order to facilitate production that will enable greater enrichment in the future. If the people deferring present consumption are the ones to benefit from the future enrichment, all is well and good. However, if the deferred consumption is used to facilitate more efficient production and greater enrichment elsewhere, there has been a mismatch.  That sums up the investment relationship between European countries and China. Europe invests nearly seven times as much in China as China does in Europe. Europe is deferring current consumption to make China a more efficient producer and – of course – competitor. Most of the arguments about trade with and investment in and from China have concentrated on the level playing field argument: a removal of tariff barriers, getting China to improve working conditions, paying attention to environmental concerns and ending counterfeiting. No attention has been paid to the question of whether we should be helping a potentially enormous emerging economy to compete with the developed world for scarce resources, compete with our industries and, possibly, direct its newfound industrial wealth into even greater military capability. The West insists on being globalist – to its own detriment – when dealing with China which, whatever its lip service to Marxist rhetoric, is in fact an economic nationalist state. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, the EU has a trade deficit with Taiwan but it has a surplus in services. The UK has a substantial trade deficit with Taiwan, a ratio of almost 3:1, which has undermined and is continuing to undermine British industry. Our surplus in services is diminishing year by year. UK investment in Taiwan dwarfs Taiwan’s investment in Britain by a factor of almost 4:1. Thus British capital, deferred consumption if you like, is financing competition from Taiwan. Furthermore, that country is investing in low-wage economies in the Far East that will also compete with all of our industries.  The rapporteurs are not commending trade with Taiwan pragmatically because it benefits the EU: they commend it because it advances the WTO objective of open trade worldwide. The EU is not pursuing European objectives, but global objectives. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, MPs must not be above the law, especially if they are implicated in crimes of violence. However, the arrest of six Greek MPs, including their party leader, at the behest of the government, only days after violent protests against their party by left-wing demonstrators following the horrific stabbing of a left-wing activist, must give us cause for concern We must think of what Pastor Martin Niemöller might have said: ‘First they came for Golden Dawn, and I did not speak out because it was not my party.’ These were the first arrests of MPs in Greece since the fall of the infamous Colonels’ dictatorship in 1974. Whatever we might think of that party, no evidence has been cited of a connection between the alleged murderer and the MPs and it appears that the arrests took place to assuage the anger of violent demonstrators. I am sure that, if the Hungarian Government had imprisoned opposition MPs instead of just tinkering with the constitution, we would have held non-stop debates. Democratic rights are not to be granted or withheld at the whim of government. We must always be sceptical when governments imprison oppositions. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, we are used to the EU using the crisis as a pretext for greater integration of Member States’ economies: it is now being used as a pretext for pooling defence industries and capabilities. Apparently, surrender of the ability to take independent action is a panacea for all ills. Sovereign states that lose their own capabilities and defence industries cease to be sovereign. Supranational bodies that gain a capacity to wage war without the express consent of member countries become, by stealth, sovereign states. But of course that is the idea. The report seems to look back at previous involvement in conflicts with a degree of nostalgia and bemoans the fact that the EU does not have a clear common security and defence policy. It refers with approval to the 2008 European Council meeting at which the objective was set to be capable of deploying a force of 60 000 in 60 days. I am afraid I cannot be sanguine about the possibility of a trigger-happy EU deploying an army of that size. Alliances such as the EU mutual defence clause have the potential for transforming a localised conflict into a world war. If we doubt it, think of 1914. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, unemployment is caused by a single currency that is overvalued for the countries of the South where youth unemployment is at its highest. It is caused by high energy costs because of the EU’s mad dash for renewables. The EU’s energy costs are between twice and four times those of the United States. It is also caused by the EU’s embrace of globalisation and unlimited trade with low-wage economies. Last but not least, it is caused by unrestricted immigration.  Mr Nuttall’s hypocrisy on this was astounding. UKIP’s leader, Mr Farage, has advocated 250 000 work permits to be issued by the UK every year. UKIP is a pro-immigration party like all of the others that have expressed pretended and very recent concerns about it. Youth unemployment is particularly significant because it is even more difficult to find a new job than it is to hold on to an existing one. However, its causes and solutions are not qualitatively different. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, whilst this might not yet apply to the UK, there are issues of wider concern. The substantive content of the proposal is completely sound. Suspects should indeed enjoy access to a lawyer as well as the other rights listed. However, in my view, there is no need for EU legislation, and indeed such legislation would not satisfy the need completely. The EU is not – not yet at least – the whole world and people travelling internationally do not restrict their visits to other Member States. What is needed is not EU legislation but an international treaty encompassing as many countries as possible throughout the world, to the effect that the rights listed should apply with reciprocity to all countries that are signatories. I cannot help feeling that this proposal is not so much about the rights of the suspect, with EU legislation being the means. It is much more about extending EU legislation competence and the rights of the suspect are simply a means to an end. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, this Presidency will be even more inspired by the EU and less by the presiding country because unusually the key player will be the President rather than the Prime Minister. Why? Because the President is a former commissioner with an EU mindset. There will be more of the same: single market, banking union, neo-liberal global free trade, talk about growth and unemployment without considering the conditions for the first or the causes of the second. The Eastern Partnership is of particular interest. We are told that the politically inspired prosecution of Yulia Tymoshenko has affected relations with Ukraine. I look forward to the politically inspired prosecution of Marine Le Pen affecting relations with France.  The most important players in the EU project are invited to Bilderberg conferences. I wonder whether the Lithuanian President was invited this year. If not, why not? I think we should be told. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, there is sometimes a presumption that if we have done nothing wrong, we have nothing to fear from surveillance. However, there is evidence that security services collect political information that is not concerned with the committing of criminal offences. Sometimes they collect personal information unconnected with politics – perhaps to create leverage over individuals. Furthermore, they do not only collect information but also sometimes engage in disruptive action on the basis of that information. We know all of this from the revelations in 2011 about the activities of a British police officer, Mark Kennedy, who infiltrated Green protest groups. Some states – the United Kingdom is a particular example – practise formal and systematic discrimination against members of named political parties. A Merseyside police officer lost his career in 2009 as the result of alleged membership of a perfectly legal but heretical political party. I will stop there. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI
). -  
Mr President, increased mobility is not so much a cure for youth unemployment as it is a cause, at least in the West. Unemployment in the South is caused directly by a euro that is over-valued for those countries, but the European Council is determined to keep on expanding the zone. The European Council wants to improve growth and competitiveness, but the EU’s energy policy pushes up energy costs, making industry less competitive. It even provides incentives for manufacturers like Corus near Middlesbrough to move production to India. Immigration – two thirds of it from outside the EU in the case of the UK – is giving our jobs to people from outside. Increasing globalism will make industry in the EU try unsuccessfully to compete with emergent economies. The European Council does not so much have a cure for the recession, it is part of the problem. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the authors of this report seem not to appreciate the irony of their calls for restrictions on freedom of speech in protection of fundamental rights. To justify themselves, they use the emotive term ‘hate speech’. Hatred is an ugly word because it is an ugly concept.  We know from the experience of France how low the threshold can be. The mere careless choice of words, such as ‘detail’ or ‘debate’, can land you in court. The FN presidential candidate in 2012 is now being prosecuted for drawing parallels between military and migratory occupation. Has Hungary, under the present government, prosecuted any opposition, presidential or other candidates? Has Hungary banned any political parties, as Belgium did in 2004? Has it attempted to ban a political party using evidence fabricated by the security services, as Germany did in 2001? Has Hungary, under the present government, acted like its predecessor in 2006 and sent armed police to attack peaceful demonstrators? Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, bonuses awarded in the fund management sector are certainly high. It is difficult to justify them morally and it is always tempting to want to do something about them. I am certainly tempted to do so. But we have got to look at this rationally. A restriction on bonuses would inevitably lead to compensatory increases in basic income. That would be worse because, of course, basic salaries – unlike bonuses – cannot easily be reduced to reflect poor performance. Should we then restrict incomes in basic salaries? Well we could, but then we should logically say that perhaps we ought to limit all people’s salaries. Do we really want the EU – or even Member States for that matter – to have that kind of power?  The real problem which needs to be addressed is the high level of expense ratios of investment funds – the amount paid by investors to the funds. In the United States, equity funds charge an average of 0.64%; in Europe most funds charge over 1%. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI
). -  
Mr President, the implementation of the Compact for Jobs and Growth is to be discussed. If only words were deeds, if only wishes were achievements. The impact of tight budgetary constraint was to be monitored, but it did not act on what it saw. You cannot make a population richer by making it poorer. It promised to promote growth and competitiveness. How do the high-wage economies of Europe compete with the slave-labour wages of the so-called ‘emergent economies’? How do countries with an over-valued currency that cannot be changed unilaterally become more competitive without devaluation?  The single market is seen as a panacea for all ills, but it has facilitated the export of jobs from higher-wage economies to lower-wage economies. Improving training for the unemployed will make individuals better able to compete with their fellows. It might also marginally improve the efficiency of industry and commerce. However, it will not increase the total number of jobs immediately.  Mr Barroso believes confidence is a key to growth. It will be effective only if that confidence is soundly based. However, investors can see that the EU’s embrace of the ideology of globalism will destroy European industry and reward the emergent economies, and they will invest accordingly. Individuals might prefer to invest in their own countries, but their investment funds are, unfortunately, profit maximisers. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, paragraph 12 of the motion for a resolution says that freedom of expression – even if it offends – is at the heart of democracy. I agree absolutely. Physical attacks on peaceful demonstrators should certainly bring Turkey’s application to the EU to a complete halt. We could also mention the attempted prosecution of Mr Orhan Pamuk for a heretical view of Turkish history – but of course, France attempted to enact an almost exact mirror image or converse of that law under which Mr Pamuk was prosecuted. Many other EU countries prosecute and imprison people for heretical, historical or political opinion. The Belgian Government of Mr Verhofstadt actually banned a political party – Vlaams Blok – and Germany tried to ban a party with fabricated evidence. Turkey certainly deserves censure, but EU Member States must put their own houses in order first. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, asylum has got far less to do with shielding people from persecution, and much more to do with serving as a pretext for facilitating immigration.  The political class knows that there is opposition to mass immigration, so they present asylum as a system over which they have no control. If applicants are not detained or allowed to seek work, they will also need housing. Jobs and houses are in short supply, so they will be employed or housed at the expense of the home populations. Perhaps complicit MEPs should open their homes to these applicants and fund them from their salaries, rather than letting the poor and dispossessed bear the burden.  Of course if asylum is refused, the applicant will be given a piece of paper asking them to leave, but there will be no coercion. They can also use the legal system to frustrate removal. An Iranian asylum seeker, Mr Rostami, came to Britain in 2001 and was refused asylum in 2002. He is still in Britain after several appeals, a prison sentence and a deportation order. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the solution to these problems, we are told, is more EU legislation and greater competence for the EU. Unlike the literary character Topsy, organised crime did not just grow: it has been facilitated by the EU. Schengen removed borders for organised crime just as it did for legitimate business. Drugs, arms and trafficked people can be more easily moved. A single currency makes it possible to launder the profits of crime much more easily anywhere in the zone, just as lax immigration controls and connivance with bogus asylum claims allow criminals and sometimes their wares to pass from one country and one continent to another.  Of course, not all organised crime involves crossing frontiers. The predominance of the same distinct population groups both in ostensibly legitimate cash business such as taxi firms and take-away food shops, and in drug dealing and prostitution, allows the profits of the latter to be laundered through the former. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, the substance of this proposal has every merit. People who have been subjected to domestic or other violence or harassment need to be protected wherever they happen to be – their home country, another EU Member State or, for that matter, anywhere in the world. I would be happier with a worldwide treaty to which all well-meaning countries would freely subscribe, recognising protection orders from other countries. To have EU legislation suggests that people move between countries only within the EU. I do not favour EU legislation on principle, but I do accept that it is better for vulnerable people to be partially protected in a form that I do not favour than not to be protected at all. I do not want to facilitate movement of people in the EU, but I do want them to be protected when they do move. Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that sometimes, behind this apparently well-meaning legislation, some people are more interested in the extension of EU legislative competence than they are in the substantive issue. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, the appalling problem of the millions of external and internal refugees cannot be considered in isolation. Their difficulties will only be overcome when the conflict comes to an end. The problem is, of course, that neither side seems likely to win decisively in the foreseeable future. The conflict is often depicted as being one between incontrovertible good – the opposition – and incontrovertible evil – the Government. In fact, both sides have committed hideous atrocities. The Government is politically repressive but socially secular. Some of the opposition are – or claim to be – both politically and socially liberal. Others, the Islamists, are neither, and they certainly are not secular. Their regime would be more oppressive than Assad’s Syria. The answer is not to provide arms to either side, and it is not to bring the population to neighbouring countries or to Europe. The answer is for the whole international community to urge talks between government and opposition without preconditions – except, of course, for a ceasefire. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, I congratulate Bosnia and Herzegovina on making little progress towards meeting the political criteria. The more resistance a country shows to the EU, the better, in my opinion. In particular it has resisted the move towards a neo-liberal market economy as distinct from simply a private enterprise economy. Apparently, too, little progress has been made towards freedom of movement, for which I might be inclined to congratulate them – until I discovered they are referring to freedom of movement within Bosnia and Herzegovina. If you are a Croat or a Bosniac, you might think twice about travelling through some parts of the Republic of Srpska. There is a coded reference to there being no shared vision. What this means is that the population is split three ways and political cooperation is minimal. Would it really be desirable to bring such a divided country into the EU? There is of course a lesson for us. A vertically-divided state is ungovernable, as Swedes in Stockholm must be concluding at this very moment. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, it is the Member States that have the responsibility to collect taxes and fight fraud, yet here the EU is trying to extend its legislative competence. It is obviously true that fraud is often committed across international borders, often by the multinationals that are so beloved by the EU’s neo-liberal policies. But ‘borders’ means all borders, and not just the borders of Member States. Action needs to be by extensive international agreement and not confined to the EU. On another subject, to talk about growth, jobs and competitiveness in the context of the EU’s energy policy is wildly optimistic. Renewable energy might well be a desirable ideal, but it is inefficient and expensive. High energy costs will not create growth, jobs and competitiveness, they will destroy them. Suppliers of energy wishing to use fossil fuels are penalised financially, and those plants will eventually be closed down. To make matters worse, emergent countries seem to be immune from strictures against the use of fossil fuels. In the UK we have vast quantities of oil locked in the ground as the result of Mrs Thatcher’s policies in the 1980s. We must discard our prejudices against fossil fuels and against nuclear energy. They will be the key to growth and jobs. The difficulty facing the eurozone will doubtless come up. Perhaps they might heed the words of Oscar Lafontaine and begin an orderly dismantling of the eurozone. Only escape from the eurozone will rescue the troubled economies of the South from permanent stagnation. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, the terms ‘pro-European’ and ‘anti-European’ are often used as shorthand for ‘pro-EU’ and ‘anti-EU’. I for one find the use of the term ‘anti-European’ to describe those of us who are opposed to EU membership, or even the existence of the EU, as highly offensive. Europe is much older and much more than the EU; it is a cultural entity, a religious entity and an entity with overlapping and related ancestries. The EU goes out of its way to welcome third-world immigration and embraces the political and economic doctrine of globalism. It is the EU that is anti-European because its policies will eventually destroy the distinctiveness of Europe. If third-world immigrants come to Europe they do not become new Europeans to replace unborn European babies, they turn parts of Europe irreversibly into the third world. It is global capitalism and the related political ideologies that fuel immigration because it regards human beings as though they were merely facts of production. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, thank you. Twenty-two years ago, Croatia fought for and eventually won its independence, for which it paid with the lives of many of its nationals. That independence has now been surrendered to the European Union. To add insult to injury, Croatia has had to pay to be allowed to surrender. Part of this price was handing over two of its generals, Generals Markac and Gotovina, to the UN War Crimes Tribunal so that they could be stigmatised – quite unjustly, as it turns out – as war criminals. Croatia is praised in the report for its democratic consolidation. Let us hope that democracy is contagious and that it spreads to the EU and its worst Member States. Croatia has been told that it must respect the rights of minorities. If some Croats have problems with minorities at present, then, in the words of Al Jolson: ‘you ain’t seen nothin’ yet’. Wait until the poor of Africa and Asia, admitted by the EU through its common immigration policy, turn up in your towns and cities and outnumber your tiny population. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, Turkey certainly abuses human rights when it prosecutes academics for expressing opinions, such as describing the 1915 killing of Armenians as genocide. Of course Turkey is not alone. France proposes an exact mirror image of that law. People will be prosecuted for saying that it was not genocide. France and many other Member States prosecute and jail people for heretical opinions, so perhaps Turkey might fit in after all. I am not an enthusiast for the European Union, but for as long as it exists, I prefer it to be more European rather than less European. Turkey is not European by its geography, ancestry, religion or culture. Whilst not being an EU enthusiast, I really find it extraordinary that a country that is still occupying nearly 40% of Cyprus should even be considered for membership. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the Prime Minister’s statement was preceded by a speech on 26 March. He spoke of the uniqueness of Europe’s regional integration being based on supposed common values. The EU talks about democracy and freedom of expression, but then it and its Member States seek to jail people for exercising that right. The values for which the EU is most enthusiastic are those of social liberalism; consensus values only amongst social liberals. He then revealed that regional integration was on the agenda all over the world. He might have said it was on the same agenda drawn up by the same people. What will this regional integration achieve? It will promote trade and remove barriers to trade not only within each region, but between regions. In that trade, Europe must be competitive, we are told.

Madam President, the eurozone and the ECB are not a solution to the difficulties of the European Union; they are part of the problem. During the early years of the eurozone, northern Europe needed low interest rates to improve its growth. However, those low interest rates caused a property boom in Spain. When that boom came to an end, the banks found that they had insufficient security for their loans. In 2011, the ECB conducted two distinct and contradictory interest rate policies. The answer is that a common interest rate, like a common currency value, cannot be appropriate for 17 different economies. The report suggests that there ought to be wage increases in the north of the EU in order to stimulate aggregate demand in the south. However, would you encourage employers to increase wages above the market rate? They will certainly not be encouraged to do so when there is a plentiful supply of labour resulting from an open-door policy on immigration, nor will they do so when they have the freedom to export jobs to the Far East by relocating industry. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, unemployment is not falling, and is unlikely to do so in 2013. The value of the euro will not allow the countries of the south to emerge from recession. Austerity programmes will not cure unemployment. You do not make countries richer by making them poorer. Globalisation might make the emergent economies richer, but it will make European countries poorer. The single market might help low income Member States, but only at the expense of higher income Member States.  Uncontrolled immigration will make unemployment even worse. We heard earlier from a Mr Farage about immigration. Is that the same Mr Farage who said in 2010, on 4 May, that the UK ought to issue a quarter of a million work permits each year? Incidentally, the Romanian citizens he was referring to were not ordinary Romanians, they were Roma. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, Syria is, of course, anything but a democracy, but not many countries in the Middle East are, including of course its fiercest critic, Saudi Arabia. Nor for that matter are all of Mr Assad’s opponents in Syria democrats.  The Syrian government’s handling of the protest was, from the beginning, grossly disproportionate, but its brutality has sometimes been matched by the opposition. We can judge a regime also by its substantive policies. Before the conflict, women were relatively liberated in Syria. Religious minorities, particularly Christians, were free to worship without interference, although, of course, some Christians have been attacked by Islamist members of the opposition.  It is all very well to bemoan the huge humanitarian toll of the conflict, but that is what happens when neither side is capable of winning decisively. It is also what happens when the protagonists are armed, albeit covertly, by outsiders.  How long will it be before the armed forces of Member States are dragged into the conflict and body bags start to be flown home to Europe? How ethical was it, and is it, for the West to encourage other people to risk their lives to advance the West’s political agenda: that is, depriving Iran of an ally and Israel of an adversary? Was regime change really worth 70 000 lives?  The priority now must be to bring the bloodshed to an end. That can happen only when there are talks, without preconditions, on neutral territory.

 Madam President, dispute resolutions are self-evidently beneficial. Most disputes with retailers over goods and services would not be worth taking to court, which means, of course, that consumer complaints would not be considered and unscrupulous traders would take advantage of this. Of course, of the various forms of ADR, arbitration is undoubtedly the best, because at least it guarantees an early conclusion.  I have a greater problem with the underlying motive for these measures. It is not primarily to improve consumer rights, but to facilitate online cross-border trade in manufactured goods. This will undoubtedly affect adversely the manufacturing sectors of the higher wage economies of the West and the retail sectors of the West.  Nevertheless, they will benefit consumers buying products at home as well as abroad. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Violence and incitement to violence must of course be recognised as thoroughly despicable criminal acts. However, it appears that racism and xenophobia go beyond violence. Can you define these terms? I asked the Commission and the Council to do so and they were not able to. Is it not absurd to try to criminalise something that cannot be defined? Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, so Mali is going to be on the agenda. All actions have consequences, some of them unintended as well as those that are planned. Those who are disposed to learn from past mistakes will recall that Britain’s war against the appalling regime in Afghanistan, and our ill-founded war against Iraq, resulted in the London bombings by third-generation Islamists from a large fifth column in Britain. The political leaders of France, Britain and the rest will not be thanked by the families of service personnel killed in this conflict or by the families of victims of retaliatory atrocities in Europe, which will be the direct result of this perceived incursion into Muslim territory. Of course the atrocities in Europe are facilitated by a large Muslim and significant Islamist population in the cities of Western Europe. Even those like the opportunists from whom we heard yesterday, who find it expedient to oppose this latest adventure, refuse to see the presence of fifth columns in Europe as the threat they undoubtedly are. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, of course British withdrawal from the EU and the recovery of exclusive use of our waters would solve the problem, but in the mean time any attempt to improve the common fisheries policy must be welcomed. Ending the practice of discarding dead and dying fish back into the sea is self-evidently right. The practice must be ended, whether it involves under-sized fish that have been caught accidentally, or less valuable fish that are discarded to make way for more valuable fish, so-called ‘high-grading’. Of course, enforcement with regard to the latter practice might be rather difficult.  Enabling Member States to enact their own conservation measures within a 12-nautical-mile zone is clearly desirable, but the Member State must be able to enforce that against other Member States. The rapporteur’s proposal that fishing concessions should cease to be freely transferable is particularly good. It would stop concessions from being bought and sold, and the concessions would remain the property of each Member State.  Successful policymaking is dependent on accurate supporting information. It has been estimated that stocks of 70% of the species caught in the EU have not been assessed accurately. The report particularly does not fully address the problem of incompatibility between the conservation of fish stocks and the survival of fishing industries. The only solution is for countries that have provided the bulk of the fish stock to be given priority in their own waters. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the year begins with unjustified optimism about growth prospects, but that recedes as the year’s realities begin to emerge. If you persuade countries to share a currency that is over-valued for some of them, if you import manufactured goods from countries of low wages and inhuman conditions and tolerate the transfer of production and investment to emergent economies, you will not get growth, you will get recession. If you import cheap labour from poorer countries, you will not get increased employment of our own nationals, you will increase unemployment. We have unsatisfied needs in our economies and unemployed people who could satisfy them. What is physically possible must be politically and financially possible or the political and financial systems are not fit for purpose. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, whilst I am not an enthusiast for the European Union, if we must have it, I prefer it to be more European rather than less European. These negotiations between the EU and Mercosur – and many other trading associations – show that the EU is not exclusively, or even mainly, focused on Europe. It is globalist. It has the ambitions that all cosmopolitans and neo-liberals have, of a borderless, undifferentiated world in which goods, services and people will move without let or hindrance.  The result of this is not only that eventually all distinctive peoples and therefore cultures will disappear, but that all wage rates and standards of living will approximate to the same level – which would not be the level that modern Europeans enjoy. The theory of international trade is that the world as a whole will be richer as the result of comparative advantage. However, it is not necessarily true that each country or continent, or each social group and sector, will also be richer. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, we have heard a lot about the priorities of the Irish Presidency, including improving economic growth and creating jobs. Of course neither is very likely at all with the euro being grossly overvalued for many of the southern European countries and the EU’s disastrous embrace of globalisation, neo-liberal economics and austerity measures.   Of course these and other priorities were not initiated by Ireland any more than Cyprus’s priorities were devised by that country. The Irish Foreign Minister let the cat out of the bag on 12 January: he said, “Today’s meeting helped to build on 18 months of Presidency preparations in close contact with the Commission”. It is all an elaborate delusion in which the rotating presidency provides a sort of demographic or democratic legitimacy to the programme of the unelected Commission. The President of the Council presides over a meeting of Member State representantives with an agenda provided for it from outside. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, I found the Cypriot President’s New Year’s Eve message refreshingly honest, as far as it went. He admitted that the policies implemented on a pan-European level had not succeeded in providing a solution to the crisis. He could, of course, have gone further and said that, if southern European countries in the eurozone were to revert to their own currencies, each being left to find its own value, those countries would enjoy export-led recoveries. He could have said that EU countries – individually or collectively – should protect their industries from imports from the so-called emergent economies. Earlier in December 2012, he did explain that the impasse on the Cyprus problem had been caused by Turkey, which used the Cyprus Presidency as an excuse. He might have added that the EU, for all its talk of solidarity, appears not to regard the Turkish occupation of Northern Cyprus and the desecration of its Christian places of worship as an impediment to talks on Turkey becoming a member.

Mr President, this report makes many valuable proposals about how companies ought to respond to restructuring. It is self-evidently right that workers should receive the maximum notice of redundancies and of course receive improved opportunities for re-employment. However, recital AC states, quite rightly, that different companies, sectors and countries have different needs, so I think Member State legislation would be more appropriate than EU legislation. There is one glaring flaw in the report. It treats the need for restructuring as though it were an autonomous need over which neither the EU nor Member States had any control. Recommendation 1 mentions the need for companies to be competitive. The question is with whom or what and why? The answer is twofold: relatively low labour costs within the EU and peripheral countries in Europe and much lower labour costs and appalling working conditions in the Third World and the so-called emergent economies. The unspoken cause of the need for restructuring is the process of globalisation which all the countries have signed up to. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, Mr Donskis is quite rightly concerned about selective justice under the guise of the rule of law, but of course only in new and transitional democracies.  In a number of EU Member States it is possible to be jailed for stating one’s views on immigration or expressing an opinion on academic subjects. Honest tyrannies that admit expressly to jailing people for being opponents are rare indeed. Nearly all tyrannies inside and outside the EU pretend that they are adhering to the rule of law but in fact they have passed laws which are tailor-made for their political opponents. France is probably the worst culprit in the EU, where the incautious choice of a word, detail or debate might lead to prosecution, as might the posing of an unfavoured analogy or comparison between events. Ms Le Pen is the latest victim of such a prosecution. Such countries are not so much democracies as gulags or prison camps. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, I am in principle opposed to all EU legislation but, other things being equal, I prefer that legislation to be in the form of a directive rather than the form of a regulation, which of course is self-enacting. The content of the 1996 Groundhandling Directive was bad enough because it resulted in an increase in short-term contracts and greater use of new staff. This has led to a fall in wage levels. The proposed regulation would bring about further liberalisation. This might look good from an accountant’s perspective, but the jobs involved include aircraft maintenance, cargo handling and dealing with passengers, encompassing security checks.  Is it really desirable to jeopardise safety, security and handling of valuables to transient staff without continuity of service? Liberalisation in this sphere, as in every other, is a recipe for oppressive working conditions, wage cuts and a lower standard of service. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI
). - 
 Mr President, the report talks of the liberalisation of trade, investment and public tendering leading to mutual benefit. Trade liberalisation is, of course, a euphemism for globalisation, which actually leads to mutual detriment. The European Union will export its industrial technology to Central America, or possibly even relocate its manufacturing there, employing cheaper labour working in inferior conditions.  Cheap, duty-free goods will flow into the EU, jeopardising profits, wages and jobs in Member States. These are already in deep recession, with rising government debt. The report boasts of the expansion of the quantity and range of goods that will be tariff-free. The commitment to public tendering will allow multinationals based in the EU to swallow up public procurement contracts in Central America. This agreement, like globalisation – of which it is a part – is not for the benefit of ordinary people there or here, but in the interests of multinational corporations. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, we are used to hearing supporters of the EU project saying that we need more economic union, not less – not a sentiment I agree with. But I would say that the European Union is not European enough, and has become wedded to the political and economic ideology of globalism. The report refers with approval to the EU document of 2006 entitled ‘Global Europe’. This agreement, like many similar ones, removes virtually all tariff and non-tariff barriers after a transitional period. The EU is moving slowly but surely towards a world free of tariffs, a situation in which all living standards in the world will gravitate to the same level. The EU is sailing under a false flag. It is not a European Union, but a global union. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, human trafficking does not need to involve the crossing of national frontiers or even travel within a country. According to the UN it includes ‘recruiting people by deception for exploitation for prostitution’ – what we in Britain call ‘grooming’. British police and politicians were for years frightened to act for fear of being called racists. When my colleagues on Bradford Metropolitan Council in 2006 proposed a motion urging action against grooming, all the other councillors and parties voted against it. Those councillors included the present Conservative MP for Keighley, who is belatedly trying to exploit the issue. Whilst nationalists came to the rescue of British adolescents, all of the other parties walked by on the other side. When my former colleague, an MEP for the North-West, tried to draw public attention to the issue, the police and CPS tried unsuccessfully to prosecute him for incitement.

– Mr President, the real problem is all manufactured imports from, and all relocations to, China and other emerging economies. Indeed, the problem lies with ourselves, or rather with yourselves – addicted to neo-liberalism and the economic and political ideology of globalism. I will let you into a secret. China might have transformed itself into a capitalist economy and country but it is not neo-liberal. It competes with us with artificially depressed wage levels, which not only reduce costs, but also prevent the development of a market for imports from the West. Flagrant patent violations, 19th century working conditions, cheap state loans and subsidies and a grossly under-valued currency. In the meanwhile, they are stock-piling resources and Western currencies. If you think that global companies originating in the West are on our side, remember they are eagerly relocating where the costs are lowest and the conditions worst. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

– Mr President, there are several distinct questions apart from the obvious one of asking whether the EU should exist to spend any money at all. Is it spending money on the right things and the right recipients? Should it be the EU, as distinct from Member States, that spends that money? There are some items on which I would be happy for no money to be spent at all: the Year of the Citizen or the resettlement of economic migrants posing as asylum seekers. There are other targets of expenditure which are perfectly proper, such as the support for industry or agriculture, but in these cases the function ought to be exercised by Member States. How much should each country pay and how much should each receive? The EU does not advertise itself as an instrument for the redistribution of income and wealth as an end in itself, although it does precisely that, in the name of social cohesion. Fellow nationals of a Member State have a sufficiently shared identity to regard the pooling of resources and support as perfectly justifiable. However, the pooling of resources and support further afield is often a stimulus for resentment and even aggression – not exactly what the EU would like to produce, which is social cohesion.

– Mr President, (inaudible)
 … austerity programmes do anything but aggravate a country’s problems of unemployment and debt. However, if people in various Member States are suffering because of those programmes, it seems a contradiction that a supranational body of which their country is a member should be asking for an increase in spending. It seems a contradiction, that is, if the country is a net contributor. Perhaps net recipients are less worried by that contradiction. Britain has always been a net contributor, which is why a previous prime minister negotiated the British rebate. Those who are now seeking to reduce our rebate by recalculating it want us to be even more of a net contributor. The UK might achieve a freeze on spending but still increase its net contribution. The British rebate is not money paid into a begging bowl held by a richer-than-average – and therefore undeserving – country; it represents the return of part of an excess of contributions over receipts.

 Mr President, ‘economic and monetary union is not an end in itself’, says the report. Quite right: it is an instrument to achieve political union. The report claims that it will achieve sustainable growth and a high level of employment, but it admits that unemployment in the 27 has risen by 50% from 2008 to 2012. In those countries for which the euro is overvalued, mass unemployment and negative growth are directly attributable to euro area membership. If they were to leave the zone they would experience export-led growth and a fall in their unemployment. The euro-led recession in the South has not left the North unscathed. Its exports to the South have been reduced severely. More control and austerity measures will not reduce debt. They will reduce employment and profits, which will cut government revenue. This will lead to more debt rather than less debt. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 – Mr President, this is an unusual example of the EU recognising a real problem which does need to be addressed internationally, though not necessarily by the EU. The problem with passing a law which prohibits people from purchasing something is that, the longer the process takes, the greater the chance of the purchasers – in this case would-be terrorists – stockpiling the items in advance of the ban. I can remember this proposal first being mentioned in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs at least a year ago, possibly longer than that, and of course we do not know when the legislation is likely to be passed and come into effect. I think it would have been preferable, initially, to agree internationally to enlist the support of the industry in adopting a voluntary code of practice, and then to encourage all countries, including Member States, to pass legislation without delay. In the UK, for example, it is possible in certain circumstances to pass a law within 24 hours. The procedure in the European Parliament is so long and detailed that it is likely that would-be offenders will already have stockpiled before the legislation is enforced. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, the report is not so much a piece of economic reasoning as a tautology. More integration is seen as necessary to achieve more integration. Coordination is not an answer to unemployment but is seen as an end in itself; it is not so much a cure for unemployment as displacement activity for those without a cure. The answer to the problems of the South is not austerity, which produces only more unemployment. It does not even do what is written on the tin, which is reducing debt. Most of the countries of Europe need reflation without inflation. We must remember that what is physically possible must be financially possible, or there is something wrong with the financial system. We need to see an abandonment of the euro experiment and southern countries released to enjoy export-led booms. We must reject globalism, protect and recreate our industries and reject the coded references in this report to wage cuts and worsened economic conditions. We must not drive down our wages and conditions... (The President cut off the speaker) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI
).  
– Madam President, the Commission’s priorities are directed towards greater integration as an end in itself and not towards measures that will solve the real economic problems facing the populations of Europe. The greatest of course is the recession, with its unemployment and under-employment, squeezed incomes and reduced benefits. Indeed, the austerity programme is calculated to produce unemployment and not to combat it. One policy area mentioned is genuine economic and monetary union: the euro, with its common external value that is hideously overvalued for the countries of the South, and which is aggravating and perpetuating the recession for them. Another Commission priority is said to be to use EU resources to improve competitiveness. Well, countries with overvalued currencies cannot compete even with other countries in their region. The EU’s embrace of globalism means that European manufacturers have to compete with emergent economies with pirated designs, workers on artificially depressed wages and slave-labour conditions.

 Mr President, the plight of minorities and refugees in Syria is indeed terrible, but who have they fled from? I went to Syria twice last summer and wrote the letter that the Syrian Government sent to help sway the UK Parliament’s vote against a bombing campaign that would have killed and displaced even more innocent victims. While I was there, I met Christian, Alawite and Muslim refugees. I can tell you that huge numbers of them have been forced from their homes by the same Jihadi rebel terrorists that the EU has done so much to help. If you really care about the people of Syria, you should insist that the CIA and Zionist warmongers stop arming their Jihadi mercenaries and you should impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia and Qatar for funding the invasion of Syria by the thousands of Islamist cut-throats from whom so many Shia, Christians, Alawites and moderate Sunnis have had to flee for their lives. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, we all agree that the Communist regime in North Korea is an undemocratic shame. What are we to make of a regime that jails its opponents on trumped-up charges and keeps them in prison, even when the political motivation for it is tape-recorded and exposed? What are we to make of a regime that claims to hold free and fair elections, but then arrests its opponents to stop them collecting and delivering the 300[nbsp ]000 signatures they need to stand? If it happened in North Korea you would rightly condemn it, but the victims in my first example are Greeks, and in my second, Italians. Because the systematic police repression of Forza Nuova activists has happened there in the last 24 hours. So stop whining about North Korea, as it is totally hypocritical unless you also stand for the right of European electors to choose Golden Dawn or Forza Nuova if they so wish. You have no power at all to change North Korea, vile though the Communist regime there undoubtedly is, but you could order your backyard occupation puppet regimes to restore democracy in Greece and Italy this afternoon. People in glass houses should not throw stones. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, what is the main aspect of EU foreign policy? To help the USA meddle around the world in places that have nothing to do with us – Iraq, Serbia, Libya, Afghanistan, Syria. You have acted as cheerleaders for aggressive neo-con interference which has benefited only radical Islamists but has destroyed societies, while costing British taxpayers billions of pounds. Now the target is Russia.  Members know full well that the so-called Ukrainian revolution was manufactured with everything from the agitprop to the snipers provided from the USA and the EU. We all know the root of the tough Russian reaction is aggressive NATO expansionism, first into Poland, next into Ukraine. Yet you persist in irresponsible sabre-rattling in someone else’s natural sphere of influence. It is said that in 1914, Europe sleepwalked into war. This time you are heading there with eyes wide open. The basic choice is war or peace. You seem hell-bent on war, so remember: whatever excuses you manufacture, plotting an aggressive war is itself a crime. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr[nbsp ]President, when the godfather of the European Union, Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, published the plan for a united Europe and the ethnocide of the peoples of Europe, the encouragement of mass non-white immigration was central to the plot. Since then, an unholy alliance of leftists, capitalists and Zionist supremacists has schemed to promote immigration and miscegenation with the deliberate aim of breeding us out of existence in our homelands. As indigenous resistance to this human genetic-modification industry grows, the criminal elite seeks new ways to camouflage their project. First, their immigrant pawns were temporary guest workers; then it was a multiracial experiment; then they were refugees, and then the answer to a shrinking population. Different excuses, different lies – and asylum is just another one. But the real aim stays the same: the biggest genocide in human history, the final solution to the Christian European problem. This crime demands a new set of Nuremberg trials, and you people will be in the dock. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nick Griffin  (NI

I have a constructive suggestion to help those poor asylum seekers from Africa. Yes, make it clear they cannot come here so they do not try to cross the sea and drown in huge numbers.

 Madam President, unlike the others in this debate I have gone twice to war-torn Syria to see at first hand what is really going on there. So I can tell you that the majority of the refugees do not want or need to come to Europe. They just want the West to leave the Syrian army to finish off the Islamist terror gangs from whom the Christians, Alawites and moderate Sunnis fled for their lives. Then they will be able to go home.  The Wahhabi minority should go to their Gulf State sponsors, where they too would be at home. I can also tell you that, having used the CIA to help the rebels destroy so much of Syria, American and French corporations are already in contact with Damascus to negotiate multi-billion-dollar reconstruction contracts. While the EU and Mr Farage unite to import a wave of violently Islamist asylum seekers to already poor and stressed parts of our constituencies, American and French companies are chasing profits for big business, as usual.

Madam President, Prime Minister, 2014 is supposed to be the year of democracy in Europe, but what kind of democracy tears up its own constitution, bans demonstrations to prove the people are happy, sends machine gun-toting storm-troopers to arrest democratically elected MPs and imprisons opponents without trial when they cannot disprove hearsay allegations made against them by police informers? Totalitarians like you always justify such attacks on freedom with propaganda lies about criminal association but, Mr Samaras, your bankers’ occupation government – now busy helping your masters loot Greece – are the real criminals. You are the heir of the communists who refused to fight when your country was invaded by Mussolini, when Metaxas said ‘no’ and fought foreign occupation and exploitation – which is of course the real crime of its modern political descendants, Golden Dawn. Nick Griffin  (NI

Mr President, there is all this fuss over the activities of an unelected pressure group which was warned in advance not to invade the waters of a sovereign nation and break legitimate laws. No Russian citizen has ever voted for Greenpeace. They have no democratic mandate whatsoever. So imagine how much bigger the fuss would be if Russia launched a totally illegal assault on a legitimately-elected political party. Imagine if the Russian Government were to use the excuse of waves of lies from a controlled mass media to arrest the leaders of the opposition. Imagine if President Putin were to tear up the constitutional rights of democratically-elected parliamentarians and spit in the face of a growing body of opinion of up to 20 % of voters. We would never hear the end of it, and rightly so. But when these things happen in Greece, you hypocrites either say nothing or actively applaud the repression. No one ever voted for Greenpeace, but half a million Greek voters have been disenfranchised by the attempted murder of Golden Dawn at the behest of EU bureaucrats, German bankers and Zionist gangsters. This looters’ coup against the Greek people by the puppets of the privatisation criminals is a thousand times more important than this artificial hysteria on behalf of an unelected, unrepresentative group of watermelon-green cranks.

Mr President, having spoken in Damascus with many relatives of victims of the Islamist war on Syria, I hope that we all welcome the Russian proposal to put chemical weapons beyond use, without an escalation of the conflict. We should do everything possible to help this diplomacy to succeed, because if it falters Obama, Hollande, Cameron and the other neo-con puppets will drag us into a conflict that is certain to spiral out of control. Obama claims there will be no boots on the ground. That is a lie, because if the US bombs Syria into the clutches of al-Qa’ida, then Syria’s chemical weapon stockpile will end up in the hands not of the United Nations decommissioning teams, but of the heirs of Osama bin Laden. American, British and European troops will then have to be sent in to try and secure those weapons, and our soldiers will die in Syria in order to stop children dying in Islamist poison gas attacks, not just in Damascus but in Paris, London and New York. That is why we should turn the Russian peace proposal into reality. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, I recently spent four days in Damascus, a city that is striking for its normality and religious tolerance. Contrary to the propaganda about repression, Sunni mosques are open and some women wear clothing which shows the Salafist sympathies of their husbands. Others wear mini-skirts. It is a secular society much like ours. I also met captured free-Syria army rebels not only from North Africa and Central Asia, but also from France and Spain. They spoke freely about their aim, once they were done in Syria, to bring their bloody jihad to Europe – to London, Paris, Madrid, Stockholm and Manchester. At least 600 EU-born Islamists are fighting with the rebels. If you send arms to Syria, they will go to men who will bring them back here and turn them against us. If you arm the rebels, you will not just help these cut-throats destroy the last tolerant secular state in the Middle East, you will also bring Wahabi terror to our streets. Stop and think before you plunge your hands in so much innocent blood. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, tonight several hundred more British old-age pensioners will freeze to death. Why? Because of fuel poverty. Because carbon profiteers, wind farm wide-boys and left-wing broadcast media like the BBC have conned and bullied and bribed MPs and MEPs into believing – or pretending to believe – that man-made global warming is going to destroy the world. This modern version of an ancient religious fantasy is being used as an excuse for the biggest corporate scam in human history. Carbon taxes make fortunes for the super rich while old Mrs Smith shivers to death. Tonight, while out-of-touch politicians waffle on about unattainable targets that will de-industrialise Europe, real people are dying one by one. There is a legal term for what the political elite are doing here: corporate manslaughter. Nick Griffin  (NI

Madam President, when we discuss violence against women, there is a desperate attempt to avoid mentioning the giant green elephant in our midst: Islam. Islam’s inherent devaluing of women and hostility to unbelievers combine to make it the greatest threat to millions of women and girls in many parts of the EU. In Britain, the crime of on-street grooming for sex, drugs and prostitution is directed against thousands of girls as young as 10. Many of the victims are beaten, threatened and gang-raped. While the majority community produces many perpetrators of internet paedophilia and one-on-one sex crimes, paedophile gang rape is a crime in which the perpetrators are overwhelmingly Muslim, while their innocent victims are invariably from other communities.  In my constituency, 14-year-old Charlene Downes was groomed, raped and murdered. Her body has never been found. The case against two Muslim men collapsed on a technicality; however, while the police say that they are not looking for anyone else, they continue to ignore evidence of jury rigging and refuse to seek a retrial. Charlene’s mother and grandmother are bravely and actively campaigning for justice. Shockingly, this has resulted in both of them being repeatedly threatened with arrest for involvement in entirely peaceful protests. The problem of officialdom turning a blind eye to the inconvenient truth about Islam and sexual violence is thus endemic. I urge those here who are concerned about this issue to face the politically-incorrect truth, because denial will not make the problem go away. Justice for Charlene Downs!

 Madam President, while the people on that side of the House are denying the facts, thousands more young girls will suffer as a direct consequence of your denial. Of course Islam is directly involved. When you have a religion which says that a woman’s rights in court are half those of a man, when you have a religion which says that a woman who is raped can be stoned to death for adultery unless she can produce four male witnesses to prove she is innocent, then of course that creates a mentality within that community which is fundamentally anti-women.  It started with Muhammad, who raped a captive – a Jewish captive – whose husband he just had murdered. He started that, and he is regarded by Muslims as the perfect man. His example colours what Muslims do. Many Muslims do not, but within their community this is real problem. You need to recognise that fact and address it, not run away from it. Nick Griffin  (NI

You say your heart beats strongly for women raped in India – mine does, too – but does your heart not also beat for the thousands of young girls gang-raped in Britain over the last few years, or are you simply left in ignorance because the facts are concealed by the controlled liberal media?

 Mr President, this is a depressing but predictable report: the persecution of hundreds of thousands of Christians, one and a half million refugees, broken infrastructure, murderous sectarian militias, daily bombings and shootings, child prostitution, honour killings, female genital mutilation and brutal Islamist repression of women. It is good to see the EU, albeit indirectly, admit that Western meddling in Iraq has led to disaster. It would be even better if the cheerleaders for the illegal war of 2003 that created this shambles were to apologise and learn from their terrible error. It is utterly hypocritical for members of the globalist elite to shed crocodile tears over the collapse of Iraq while at the same time striving to replicate it in Syria. Just as in Iraq, so the fall of Assad would lead not to Syria becoming a replica Switzerland, but to its collapse into bloody anarchy and the triumph of Wahhabi fundamentalism. This meddling has already helped kill hundreds of thousands in Iraq. It is time for a little humility and to leave Syria to the Syrians. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, I was an international observer in the Ukraine elections. I had unrestricted access in Kiev to polling stations, election officials and party activists.  I have seen corrupt elections where gangs of thugs sponsored by the prime minister attack opposition activists; where council workers are threatened with losing their jobs if they vote the wrong way on ballot papers that carry traceable serial marks; where two million voters do not even exist but still vote by post; where, at the close of polls, unsealed ballot boxes are taken to central counting places by unsupervised officials; where the election officials are appointed by the local ruling party. But all these assaults on democracy go on routinely in the United Kingdom. In Ukraine I saw a robust and well-designed system, ensuring elections which, while not perfect, are much freer and fairer than those in Britain. EU hypocrites do not have any right to criticise Ukrainian elections. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Madam President, the fracking debate is full of deceit by those who stand to profit from shale gas or who see it as a weapon in neocon hostility to Russia. We are told that most fracking in the USA is by small and medium-sized enterprises, yet few real SMEs have the capital or technology for fracking. What looked like SMEs are in fact limited liability fronts for giant corporations. They exist solely to spare the parent companies the huge cost of eventual clean-up operations, which will therefore fall on the taxpayers. The game is simple: loot, pollute and scoot. Claims of massive job creation are lies too. The Public Policy Institute of New York State claimed that 500 new wells per year would produce 62 000 jobs, yet a review by Food and Water Watch showed that the true figure is fewer than 7 000, scarcely one tenth of the promised boom. In every part of the USA where shale gas is exploited, house prices crash by 25%, with environmental devastation from hundreds of platforms and huge, poisoned slurry ponds. The longer-term threat to water supplies could be even more costly. Gas fracking is short-termist, boom-and-bust exploitation. Yes, it produces energy, but so would burning all our forests. It makes no sense except to lobbyists and politicians in the pay of the companies doing the looting. The answer to the energy crunch is not short-term fracking but long-term, safe, sustainable nuclear power and electricity- and hydrogen-fuelled transport systems. That is the energy economy of the future. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Madam President, the voluntary system proposed would have very little effect on Britain because the British system is already very effective. But I have heard from a number of constituents who are concerned that anything involved in the transportation of live animals can, in the end, be used to facilitate the transport of animals for slaughter over a long distance. This is something that is clearly unnecessary in an era of modern refrigeration, and which needs to be phased out. On the question of labelling, the great concern of everyone concerned with animal welfare is that all meat originating from animals suffering ritual slaughter should be labelled: consumers have the right to know and to reject it. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, in May, President Barroso bragged of the EU and its Member States throwing EUR 1.2 billion a year down the Afghan drain. But EUR 1.2 billion is only a fraction of the true cost. Britain’s contribution alone to the Afghan farce, according to the British Ministry of Defence, is already over GBP 18 billion, plus GBP 3 billion in aid, plus GBP 4 billion in equipment that is to be left behind, plus GBP 5 billion that will be screwed out of the British taxpayer to run Afghanistan for a further 30 years. Most importantly, 417 British dead are the highest price of all and the most obscene, because it is a war that has nothing to do with Britain. We should bring our troops home at once and put the neo-con crooks who sent them there on trial as war criminals. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, no decent human being can feel anything other than deep sympathy for young men who leave their families and risk death in overcrowded boats in order to reach a new land of milk and honey. But why do they do it? Who is responsible for luring these poor people into so much disappointment and even danger? The politicians. Because every time the political class insists on giving one batch of immigrants the houses, taxes and jobs that belong to the long-suffering natives in Manchester or Malmö or Brussels or Birmingham, you incite another boatload to risk their lives to get to the promised land and be given other peoples’ milk and honey. Three simple rules would end the immigration crisis. One: no jobs for immigrants while our own people face mass unemployment. Two: if a greedy boss is caught employing illegal labour, the business should be confiscated. Three: if you have not paid in, you do not get a house or a penny in benefits. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, it would be easy to mock this report. Indeed, it is being laughed at by millions of British voters reading their papers this morning. Coming at a time when the euro disaster is breaking nations and driving desperate people to suicide, this staggering exercise in politically correct sloganising could – had it been on the agenda at the start of this month – easily have been mistaken for an April Fool’s joke. But in truth, this attempt to institutionalise discrimination and contempt against half the population of Europe is not a laughing matter. Men and women are conceived to complement each other for the common good. This proposal is an attempt to sow discord between the sexes, break family values and export EU Frankfurt School poison worldwide, using the excuse of climate change. Such incitement to gender-based contempt, division and hate is not a victimless crime. Hundreds of thousands of men are denied access to their children after bitter divorces. Thousands of children are snatched by the state because the crucial importance of fathers and loving, united families is denied and undermined by militant feminism of the sort that underlies this report. Meanwhile, there are real problems out there hurting real people. Voters expect us at least to try to solve them, not to waste our time and their money on sexist anti-male, anti-family gibberish. Ladies and gentlemen, please, let us drop this empty, bigoted sloganising and work together to deal with real problems. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, be careful what you wish for because you may get it. This old saying is very true about reducing our use of hydrocarbons. By 2050 we will have a low-carbon economy for the simple reason that we will largely have run out of carbon. All the increases in non-conventional hydrocarbons, including from environmentally catastrophic shale oil and gas fracking, are only just about keeping up with the worldwide decline of conventional oil production. The long emergency of peak oil has begun. Those who think we can deal with it by building wind farms and eating nut cutlets may mean well, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. The biggest threat is to food production. In agriculture, before the age of oil, for every calorie of energy invested by man, horse or ox, the average return was one-and-a-half calories. On that small surplus our ancestors built their cathedrals, painted their Rembrandts and wrote their Rights of Man. Oil-based agriculture uses far fewer people to produce far more food. Its ratio is twenty-to-one. That is an input of 20 calories of oil energy for machinery, fertilisers and pesticides for every calorie of food produced. Today’s globalised world is a house of cards, built on the suicidally-unsustainable use of finite fossilised sunlight. This is the real carbon crisis which we need to address. If we continue to fail to do so, today’s children will look back in despair at all the time and energy that our generation wasted trying to kill the wrong pig. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, as an observer in Moscow at the Duma elections, I witnessed a robust system which is far more democratic than the fraud-ridden shambles in Britain. If observers come to elections in London this May, they will find hundreds of thousands of non-existent ghosts voting by post without any kind of ID check. They will see flimsy cardboard ballot boxes with voting papers falling out of gaps at the bottom, mainly under the control of appointees of Baroness Ashton’s Labour Party. At least the Russians have elections. Baroness Ashton became one of the most powerful figures in post-democratic Europe without a single vote. And who elected the technocrats now asset-stripping occupied Greece and Italy? We all know the real reasons for the attacks on Putin. George Soros and his banker friends want to privatise and loot Russia just like they are looting the West. So forget about the specks of dust in Mr Putin’s eye and remove the giant planks of electoral fraud and elite greed from the European Union’s. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, I can start by saying that Mr Bové’s report is so comprehensive that it is difficult to add anything to the excellent job he has done. But I will point out that, with agricultural wages in Morocco at an average of just five euros a day, trade liberalisation can only add to the desperate plight of farmers in Greece, Sicily and Spain. It is madness for the EU to give preferential treatment to big business concerns exploiting the Maghreb while its banking elite force murderous poverty on hard-working people in our own back yard. Since not even the most crazed global-warmist still claims that we will soon be growing olives in Lancashire or oranges in Kent, it follows that we will have to continue to import such produce. Let us do so from our hard-pressed fellow Europeans in Greece, Italy, France, Portugal and Spain. Leave the farmland of Morocco to support farming families in Morocco, rather than helping international agri-business swallow it all up and spit the human wreckage out at our shores as destitute and angry Islamist refugees. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, on weapons of mass destruction, one should remember how politicians and media liars queued up to demand action against Iraq over WMDs. That propaganda lie justified sanctions and an illegal war. MEPs who voted for sanctions against Iraq over those non-existent WMDs might have meant well, but they helped to murder hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children, who died through lack of food and medicine. Now it is nuclear weapons of mass destruction. It is a new target, Iran, but the main victims will be the same – children – because a successful oil and banking embargo would make it impossible for Iran to buy enough food and medicine for its population. If the EU votes for sanctions it exposes itself as bankrupt – not merely financially, but morally too. If Saudi Wahabis and Zionist neo-Cons want war with Iran, that is their business, but it is not ours, and we should stay out of it.

 Mr President, I am no friend of Iran. I am very critical of Islam and all things Islamic, and the Islamic threat to Europe. But, as regards the Middle East, that is the affair of the countries of the Middle East. It is not for us to interfere. When the Iranians look at what happened to Libya – which did not have effective weapons – you really cannot blame them for wanting to defend themselves, if that is what they are doing. As for weapons of mass destruction, however, we have heard the lies before and I think we are hearing the lies again. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, in discussing Durban, the most obvious question is whether an agreement last year to reach an agreement in three years’ time to do something in eight years’ time is really an agreement at all. Likewise, one has to ask whether the agreement to create a green climate fund and transfer USD 1 billion a year from hard-pressed taxpayers in countries like Britain to corrupt third world oligarchies reflects a serious threat of global communism or a happily unattainable fantasy. Given the way in which EU Commissioners are forcing economically suicidal spending cuts on the protectorates of Greece and Italy – a move likely to spark a chain-reaction implosion of the entire financial system – the fantasy answer is fortunately the more realistic. But the most significant thing about Durban is what was not discussed: climate science. This is no surprise, as it is now crystal clear that the so-called scientific consensus on man-made global warming simply does not exist. It is not just a matter of the thousands of independent scientists who dispute the whole theory: even the warmists themselves now admit that the computer models on which the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) cult is based are simplistic and flawed. The more they learn about feedback mechanisms and the complexity of real climate, the more they realise they do not know. To crucify our taxpayers and de-industrialise our economies in pursuit of the one-world government madness of the United Nations is therefore crazy. Hence the failure of 10 000 well-meaning tax-eaters to agree anything serious in Durban is to be warmly applauded. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, when there is a stench of death and decay in your house, there is no point complaining about the neighbour’s drains or arguing about which air freshener to try next. The first thing to do is to admit that the real problem is the rotting corpse of the dead elephant in the living room. It is absurd to speak of economic governance while ignoring the root cause of the debt crisis that is dragging Europe, and indeed the world, down to economic disaster. The thing that is rotten is the fiat money banking system. A system that allows the banks to create credit out of nothing and lend it into circulation as interest-bearing debt; a system that makes bankers the masters of the universe, instead of the servants of productive industry. A system that leads to poverty, division and war. The first step to long-term economic stability is to put an end to the international bankers’ swindle and restore the power to create credit to sovereign national governments. This is the only way out of the crisis; the way to prosperity and peace. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Madam President, my constituency is suffering a hidden epidemic of sexual grooming so I appreciate the efforts of all those involved in producing this report. The grassroots campaigners for the protection of children tell me that the report misses the most important target. To concentrate on online pornography while relegating real-life child sexual abuse to a page 33 annex is to worry about a speck in one eye while ignoring a splintered plank in another. Real-life abuse is described in the report as ‘offline grooming’. Such terminology is an insult to the victims and their families. It is not offline: it is on our streets. It is not a matter of images: it is a matter of real-life degradation, gang rape, and even murder. But because a disproportionately large number of street groomers are Muslims, politically-correct censorship prevents the issue from being properly discussed. Because of this deliberate downplaying of the problem, on-street grooming is not even a specific offence in many countries. As a result, the crime remains statistically virtually invisible. This undermines attempts to secure justice for the victims, effective responses from the authorities, and proper penalties for the perpetrators. In my own constituency, the family of Charlene Downs still waits for justice following the botched prosecution of those arrested over the grooming, rape and murder of their little girl in 2003. Despite their belief that 60 other girls had been groomed by the same gang, and that Charlene’s body was disposed of in kebabs, the police regarded their report as too sensitive to publish. The consequences of such cowardice became clear four years later when 15-year-old Paige Chivers went missing, believed murdered, at the hands of the same gang. Of course, not all police officers are politically correct cowards, any more than all Muslims are groomers. The vast majority are as sickened by these things as we are, but the playing down of the problem in reports like this aids the criminal minority and leaves new victims at risk. The more serious crimes should get the attention. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, for some years now climate realists like me have struggled to understand what lies behind the man-made global warming hoax which will be further exploited at Rio+20. Various theories have been put forward. Post-1989, it gave the far left a new stick with which to beat the West. Maurice Strong and the United Nations saw it as a way of promoting one-world government. It has handed carbon traders and wind factory profiteers a taxpayer-funded blank cheque. But none of the above explains the hitherto puzzling role of big oil and neo-con foundations in funding the environmentalist protest groups which have led the climate-change and anti-nuclear propaganda offensives. Now, however, their real agenda is coming to light. Phoney green hysteria has blocked the potential for nuclear and coal electricity to power our civilisation in the post-peak oil world. This gap allows those who will profit from gas fracking to say that we have no choice but to exploit this environmentally disastrous energy source. Of course we have no choice, because their useful idiot Greens have denied us the other alternatives. So now we face a fracking gold rush in, among other targets, Lancashire, Wales, southern England, France and Poland, where George Soros has just won an almost exclusive licence to loot and pollute almost the entire country. The neo-cons and globalists are also excited about the potential of fracked gas to advance their geopolitical agenda of reducing the influence of Russia and destabilising the Arab world. Climate change never was about drowning polar bears. It was always about big business profit and elite power. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, EUR 1 billion every year: that is the amount of taxpayers’ money that the Commission and Member States give to the Palestinian Authority. EUR 1 billion a year to a corrupt regime that does very little for its own people, while ordinary voters in our countries are crushed by rising taxes and inflation. It is unreal. Worse than that, EU policy is based on the false concept that a two-state solution is workable. It might have been once, but it is too late now. The Palestinians are geographically dispersed: over two million live east of the 1947 armistice lines, a million in Gaza, and about a million in Israel. In the Occupied Territories, the illegal Zionist settlement programme has sliced their land into disjointed parcels. Even if all the territories conquered in 1967 were included, Palestine would still be only 22% of the territory of the current Greater Israel. It would be an economic basket case, forever reliant on foreign aid handouts. The two-state solution sounds pretty, but it is simply not realistic. Yet again, the EU is throwing money away on a policy doomed to failure. We must accept that we cannot solve every problem in the world. We should turn our attention and money to solving our own. Let us face it: thanks to the euro disaster, this place is not going to run out of problems. EU meddling in the Holy Land is not only stealing money from overtaxed British families; combined with even more massive US aid for Israel it encourages both sides to refuse to get serious about sorting out their own differences. None of it helps real people. It is a counterproductive waste of EUR 1 billion a year. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, my voters and my party are overwhelmingly sceptical about GM crops. Like the majority of voters in every country of Europe, we reject technology imposed for the profit of giant multinationals without safeguards or consent. We reject technology that will replace sustainable local family farming with short-sighted international agri-business. Where we part company with the Commission is over the way in which the Europhiles, as always, are seeking to exploit such genuine concerns and real problems by pushing for federal European solutions. This report, giving back a little power to nation-states, is a welcome exception. But, in the long term, if the people of Britain want to secure the freedom to reject Frankenstein foods, they will not get it by bowing to the European project. They will only get it when they reject the rule of the corrupt Westminster political elite and their big business puppet masters, because it is that out-of-touch greedy elite which is forcing upon us both Frankenstein foods and the Frankenstein monster that is the European Union. Our voters demand the freedom to reject both in free and fair referendums. The Westminster elite is not only allowing reckless multinationals to genetically modify our food, their mass immigration policy is also genetically modifying the entire British population, just as your utopian multiculturalism is destroying traditional identities all over Europe. This is why, both in Westminster and Strasbourg, we the people have to get rid of the elites before the elites get rid of us. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, first it was cucumbers, yesterday it was bean sprouts. Today, it is not bean sprouts. The truth is that the experts just do not know, but each time such allegations are made, they destroy livelihoods in countries’ economies. What we do know is that there is something very strange about this outbreak. There is an unnatural combination of strains and DNA in the virus. It is affecting unusual groups of people in a way not normally associated with E coli outbreaks. It has already struck far more people and in far more places than a normal outbreak and, unlike in normal outbreaks, it has not been rapidly traced to one or two food suppliers. Given all these inexplicable factors and the fact that various countries – including Britain, the USA, Iraq and Israel – have, in the past, been reported as experimenting with genetically manipulated E coli as a biological weapon, should there not be an urgent inquiry into the possibility that this outbreak is, in fact, an instance of, and perhaps a test run for, biological terrorism?

 I voted to oppose the removal of the Parliamentary immunity of Bruno Gollnisch because: 1. Free speech is a core value of our society and the cornerstone of our democracy. It should not be curtailed by political opponents. The comments attributed to Mr Gollnisch were not incitements to violence and were not abusive or insulting. The comments were about the intolerance of Islamist regimes towards Unbelievers. 2. No debate was allowed before the votes on this issue, which affect the fundamental rights of an MEP. 3. The proposal to lift Bruno Gollnisch’s immunity (and the politically motivated decision to lift it) were inconsistent with the proposal to allow the German MEP Elmar Brok to retain his immunity from prosecution for an (alleged) greed offence of tax evasion. It is clear that the prosecution is a vexatious one, by a private organisation, designed to deprive Mr Gollnisch of his elected position and his good name. It is equally clear that, in the increasingly intolerant atmosphere of Political Correctness that is permeating the Parliament, some MEPs are more equal than others. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, the explosion at Chernobyl was a disaster, but let us keep it in perspective: 64 people were killed by Chernobyl radiation over 23 years, and it caused an unknown proportion of 6000 cases of thyroid cancer. These are tragic figures but they pale into insignificance compared to the death toll on our roads. Yet, while no one is using road traffic accidents to campaign to ban the motor car, a small army of leftists is using Chernobyl to push for an end to nuclear power. I do not doubt that they mean well but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. The same people meant well when they helped to create the biofuels rush, pushing the price of food beyond the reach of the world’s poor. Tonight millions of children will go to bed slowly dying of hunger because people on that side of the House meant well: that is what the fuzzy ideals of the Utopian left do in the real world. The impact of a nuclear ban would be even worse because the alternative to nuclear power is not wind farms and solar panels. In our energy-scarce, post-peak oil world, the alternative to reactors is mass starvation. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, as is so common here, this debate has little connection to reality and none whatsoever to democracy. Most here talk as though Iceland being sucked into the Euro black hole is a done deal. But that is not the message coming from Icelanders. Current opinion polls show that those who wish to keep their independence outnumber the Euro-Quislings and Europhiles nearly two to one. Seventy-five percent of Icelanders wisely do not trust the EU. The only Icelandic party in favour of membership has slumped from 30% to 18% in the polls. It is the same all over Europe. While the political elite move to ever closer union and federal empire, the people want freedom and independence. Such mismatches are the seedbed of revolution. Congratulate yourselves on accession progress all you like, but the coming financial meltdown in the countries being crushed in your Euro straightjacket will be costly to us all, but fatal to your Utopia. Iceland, and the nations now stuck in your raspberry Reich, will be free at last. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, as I hear discussions on ways to screw more money out of the little people in the name of climate change, I am struck by two things. The first is how no one talks about global warming anymore. Even the most out-of-touch MEPs have clearly realised that exposés of fraudulent pseudoscience and record cold winters across the globe have made the public, rightly, very sceptical about all the deceitful propaganda about drowning polar bears. The second is the car park beneath us – Porches, Mercedes, BMWs, SUVs, a showroom of gas-guzzling luxury from the people who tut-tut in disapproval at many white vans and plot to make working lives even harder with speed limiters and financial penalties, all for a dogma based on discredited statistics pedalled by a clique of bought and paid-for academics, funded and hyped by super-rich vested interests in the green industrial complex – Al Gore, Prince Charles, Shell and Goldman Sachs – all of whom stand to steal a fortune from the taxes harvested through wind factory subsidies and carbon trading. While I appreciate the efforts of some MEPs to blunt the worst excesses of this CO2
 hysteria, the plain truth is that anyone who even gives credence to the threadbare hoax of man-made global warming is a collaborator with the deadliest scam in history. Yes, deadly, because it is not only robbing ordinary people and de-industrialising the West; it is also right now starving to death hundreds of thousands of the world’s poorest children as food crops are replaced by taxpayer-subsidised biofuels. But it is boosting profits for Monsanto and giving MEPs all expenses paid trips to palm oil plantations in Malaysia, so that is all right is it not? No, it is not, particularly as it is diverting attention from the real crisis – not that we are releasing carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, but that we are beginning to run low on the oil which powers our civilisation. Every day wasted talking about limiting emissions of nature’s most important fertiliser is a day lost in the struggle to sustain more and more people on less and less energy. If it was not such a tragedy, it would be a farce. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, I do not know if the House noticed, but yesterday was also the record snowfall in Korea for 100 years, so it is not just a few places. Just as it was two years ago in Copenhagen, when the climate change conference was there, it was the coldest at the climate change conference in Cancún that it had been for decades. Secondly, there is no evidence whatsoever of meltwater from the Arctic impeding the Gulf Stream. There has been no change in that whatsoever. Thirdly, your arguments would be more effective if the climate change computer models had foreseen this a couple of years ago. They did not. A couple of years ago, we were told that our children would not know what snow was. What an absolute nonsense this has been. Finally, as for the statistics showing a global warming trend, the key factor everyone is ignoring here is that 65% of the world’s weather stations are within 10 metres of an artificial heat source. They are virtually all in cities. The collapse of the Soviet Union meant that most of the weather stations in naturally cold areas were closed down. That is what has skewed the statistics, which are fundamentally bogus because people, boosted by the United Nations, set about finding man-made global warming in order to impose the solutions they wanted.

 Madam President, a young woman in my constituency has this morning, as every weekday morning at this time, just returned home from walking her two young children to school. Jenny used to drive them there but she can no longer afford to put petrol in the car for anything other than her twice-weekly trip to the cheapest supermarket in her part of Manchester. This morning, as every morning, Jenny is hungry because she has a choice for breakfast: either she eats or her two little girls eat. There is not enough bread and jam for all of them. Meanwhile, here on planet EU, MEPs discuss tweaks to a financial instrument that involves the spending of EUR 1.1 billion of taxpayers’ money on promoting democracy and human rights, mainly in the third world. Most of those tweaks further reduce the oversight the nation states have, as the Commission burns its way through vast amounts of British taxpayers’ money. What a waste and what hypocrisy to bang on about women’s rights in Africa when thousands of Jennies cannot even feed their kids properly. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Madam President, this report demolishes the lies of the British political class about the Afghan War. I do not know the names of any of the innocent Afghan victims of this wicked war, but I do know that it has nothing to do with British interests. And I know the names of the 18 brave young men from my constituency who paid with their lives for this madness in the last year alone. Corporal Simon Hornby, Liverpool; Warrant Officer David Markland, Lancashire; Kingsman Sean Dawson, Stalybridge; Corporal Harvey Holmes, Hyde; Corporal Terry Webster, Chester; Lance Corporal Andrew Breeze, Manchester; Marine Steven Birdsall, Warrington; Marine Paul Warren, Preston; Sergeant Steven Darbyshire, Wigan; Private Alex Isaac, Wirral; Private Douglas Halliday, Wallasey; Colour Sergeant Martyn Horton, Runcorn; Private Thomas Sephton, Warrington; Sergeant David Monkhouse, Cumbria; Sapper Darren Foster, Carlisle; Lance Corporal Jordan Bancroft, Burnley; Kingsman Darren Deady, Bolton; Guardsman Christopher Davies, St Helens. What a criminal waste of brave young lives! It is, of course, no business of the European Union what wars Britain should or should not fight. That is for the British people and our elected representatives in our House of Parliament in Westminster to decide, just as it will be for us to decide one happy day to put Messrs Blair, Brown and Cameron on trial for war crimes, because Afghanistan, just like Iraq, is a criminal war.

– Mr President, as carbon crooks and One World Government conspirators celebrate their advances at Cancún, UK Prime Minister Dave Cameron declared his satisfaction with the outcome. At the end of the coldest first half of December in central England since records began in 1772, Dave is satisfied that the Green Climate Fund will cost British taxpayers GBP 2.9 billion on top of the GBP 18.3 billion a year that the Climate Change Act siphons from British consumers for the corporate crooks in the green industrial complex. Coincidently, GBP 2.9 billion is also the amount the Treasury will save by increasing the debts of British students, condemning them to a lifetime of bondage to the banks. That scam has already caused student riots. Taxpayer riots over far bigger scams – bail-outs to corrupt and incompetent banks, propping up the zombie euro and the global warming hoax – are yet to come, but come they will and, unlike Prince Charles and Camilla, their targets will deserve everything they get.

– Mr President, I should like to say to the Commissioner that the new energy strategy report ignores the elephant in the living room: peak oil. But at least the Commission has at last woken up to this gigantic and immediate threat. The moment one recognises peak oil, the majority of this largely well-meaning report becomes, sadly, incinerator fuel. The huge energy gap opening up cannot possibly be filled by Mickey Mouse renewables or shale carbons. Coal, nuclear fusion – and in the long term nuclear fusion plus fission – are the only energy sources dense enough to save us as the oil age comes to an end. Commissioner, now that this has been recognised, can we look forward to a new, serious approach to energy? We must ditch all the nonsense about wind-power grids and global warming and concentrate on real scientific solutions to the peak oil crisis. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, choosing sunny Mexico for COP 16 was a good move. We should be spared a repeat of last year’s embarrassment, when global warmists shivered in the coldest Copenhagen December for decades. Likewise, using the deceitfully ambiguous term ‘climate change’ rather than ‘global warming’ may blind a few British taxpayers to the irony of holding it just as an unusually cold summer gives way to an early, icy winter. An even better trick would be to hold these events only in the spring: look, it is getting warmer every day. How much longer can the fascistic EU impose ever more punitive taxes and controls on ordinary citizens on the pretext of man-made global warming, when an ever-increasing number of real scientists are rejecting the theory as unfounded and demolished? AGW is baseless propaganda, a Josef Goebbels-scale big lie from the green industrial complex because they favour massive transfers of wealth from the little people to carbon-trading crooks, such as Al Gore and Goldman Sachs. And it is being exploited by leftist political elites to complete the deindustrialisation of the west because spineless conservatives are too browbeaten by global warming hysteria to stand up and tell the really inconvenient truth: man-made climate change is the most profitable con trick in history. This year’s Bilderberg conference, held in Spain in June, included a session on the dangers of global cooling. When will the new realism of the people who really shape global politics creep in here, among the people who merely think they do? Andrew Henry William Brons and Nick Griffin  (NI

– We abstained on the Bilbao Barandica, Gallagher and Ferreira reports on the grounds that they contained beneficial and harmful proposals in the same instrument. However, we voted in favour of the Gróbarczyk report, despite having misgivings about some of its content (e.g. its suggestion that the discard system might have worked well for certain species of fish – we are opposed to the discard system completely). We voted in favour of it because it promised a review of the discard system. This is about as much as we can hope for within the confines of the common fisheries policy. Nick Griffin  (NI
).  
– Mr President, it is good that the EU is trying to preserve endangered fish stocks, but before there is too much self-congratulation on these proposals, we must remember that many past EU fishing rules have been appalling failures. Britain’s home waters have been fished to near extinction under European fisheries policies. The reality is that the protection of fish stocks is best left to local fishermen and national government marine scientists, not EU bureaucrats. The advice from the men working in the broken remnants of Britain’s fishing fleets is simple: scrap quota systems, which lead to discards and high grading, and replace them with weight-based catch limits so that all fish caught are landed for human consumption or for processing into animal and fish feed. We need to replace the system of openly tradeable quotas and so stop financiers, supermarkets and the super rich from speculating in fishermen’s livelihoods. Quotas of all kinds – and in whichever seas – should be owned by fishermen from ports with traditional connections to those waters and be tradeable only between fishermen who are likewise entitled to fish by personal, family and community connections.

 Mr President, before taking advice from any expert it is wise to examine their record to check that they are competent. The Integrated Maritime Policy report is partly the work of the Committee on Fisheries, so before buying into its grand schemes it is worthwhile taking a critical look at the European Union’s record on the management of the seas. Inevitably, this means assessing the situation in the former sovereign UK waters, secretly betrayed to European bureaucracy control in 1973, since nearly 70% of so-called ‘EU fishing stocks’ are actually British fishing stocks. How have our fish and our fishermen fared under the common fisheries policy (CFP)? The figures tell us far more than all the fine words in this report. 88% of the EU’s stocks are overfished, against a global average of about 27%. 30% of our fish species are now officially outside safe biological limits, because there are too few adult fish left for normal reproduction. Under the CFP’s obscene quota system, nearly a million tonnes of fish are discarded dead into the North Sea alone every year. Meanwhile, the industrial hoovering-up of species such as sand eels has led to crashing populations of bird species such as puffins. To Europe’s south, the picture is just as bad. West African fishermen, whose lifestyle had been sustained for generations, are being forced to switch to people trafficking because EU-registered vessels have helped fish their waters to extinction. It is time for the EU to acknowledge that its record in maritime management is the worst in the entire world, a typical example of what is known as the tragedy of the commons – the phenomenon by which shared resources always get exploited ruthlessly, because anyone who exercises restraint is disadvantaged by the unscrupulous. It is time to restore control of the seas and fishing grounds to the sovereign nations, whose track record has shown them fit to exercise such stewardship. In the case of the two-thirds of EU waters that the EU has fished to extinction, that means the British nation and British fishermen. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, as is so often the case with EU proposals, these financial instruments include measures which have great emotional appeal. All decent people like us want to stop drug smuggling, people trafficking and the supply of small arms to conflict zones, but it is very easy to be emotional and generous with other people’s money. Thus, while ordinary people in Greece, France, Ireland and Great Britain are having their societies ripped apart by cuts and their backs broken by taxes, the Scholz report will add EUR 176 million to the EUR 172 million already committed to help third-world capitalists gobble up even more of our jobs. The Goerens report will blow EUR 190 million, including EUR 17.4 million for a facility for rapid response to soaring food prices in developing countries. It may have escaped your attention, but food prices are soaring in our constituencies as well. Worst of all, however, is the Brantner report. Here, on page nine, it speaks of a financial envelope of EUR 2 062 billion by 2013. This is, of course, a misprint. I hope to God it is a misprint, but the fact that such a ridiculous error could slip past all the experts and MEPs who have read this report speaks volumes for the careless abandon with which the European Union spends money. This money does not grow on trees. It is not handed out by a giant tooth fairy. It is not the Commission’s money; it is not MEPs’ money. It is taxpayers’ money and a hugely disproportionate amount of it is British taxpayers’ money. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Madam President, the real significance of the Deepwater disaster is being missed. The real question is why BP is drilling for oil through 5 000 metres of rock, in water 1 500 metres deep, in the middle of a hurricane zone. The answer is peak oil – the point at which we have used the half of the world’s reserves that were easy, safe and cheap to produce, and now rely on shrinking reserves which are increasingly inaccessible, dangerous and expensive, both financially and environmentally. Deepwater is merely a symptom of peak oil. Using it as an excuse for yet another EU power grab will not stop us reaching peak or suffering its potentially catastrophic consequences. Instead of talking about symptoms, it is time to get serious about the disease: the fact that we have used all the easy oil and are still addicted to the stuff. In recent months, this reality has begun to dawn on – among others – President Obama, the British Government and the German military. It is time for the EU to take its head out of the sand, stop obsessing about climate change, and study and address the real crisis: peak oil. Nick Griffin  (NI

Mr President, the prospect of being jailed for thought crimes is shocking. Unlike most of the people here, I can tell you that from personal experience. The British Government has tried to jail me three times under anti-free-speech laws that state that telling the truth is no defence. So I am very sympathetic to Chinese, and especially Tibetan, dissidents forced into slave labour in Communist prison camps. Steps must be taken to prevent the goods they make being allowed to undercut manufacturing and workers in the West. But, if one accepts that items made by forced labour constitute unfair competition, it is impossible to avoid the same conclusion about goods made by sweated labour, by workers who are not allowed to organise into trade unions in a country where there are no environmental protection costs. The truth is that all manufactured goods from China constitute unfair competition. Trade with China, far from being free, costs millions of jobs and destroys our manufacturing base. It is time to protect our workers from this unholy alliance of Communist tyranny and capitalist greed. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, lawyers chase ambulances: where there is an accident, there is a parasite rushing in to profit from someone’s misfortune. The advocates of European Union are ambulance-chasers extraordinaire: from the fantasy of man-made global warming, to earthquakes and forest fires, every crisis becomes an excuse to grab even more power. The Russia-Ukraine gas crisis was an artificial problem caused by neo-con interference in the politics of Eastern Europe. The answer is to stop ‘baiting the bear’ and to leave the nations of Europe free to buy the gas that Russia needs to sell us. Instead, the crisis is used as an excuse for the EU to seize control of gas supplies and ensnare us all in a web of interdependence designed to enforce the Union that voters would never approve. This is not about gas supplies. It is the creeping tyranny of a Socialist superstate using deceit to grab what it cannot get democratically. When it drops the mask of reasonable necessity, its new fascism will be imposed, not with castor oil, but with deadly cold. That is why freedom lovers will vote against this report. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Madam President, the defining feature of the EU conspiracy, apart from endemic waste and fraud, is that it rides roughshod over the wishes of real people. The push to bully Iceland into surrendering to EU rule is an example. Gallup polls reveal that 60% of Icelanders want to retain their freedom by staying out of the EU. Only 26% are now fooled by the pro-Union propaganda of the corporate media. This is no surprise. Icelanders have the oldest tradition of true democracy in the world. They do not want to exchange it for rule by unelected commissars. Icelanders have some of the last great fish stocks in the world. They want to preserve them from being destroyed, as EU membership has destroyed Britain’s fish stocks. Icelanders are proud of their Viking origins, vibrant culture and identity. EU rule would doom Reykjavik to becoming a scale model of the Muslim ghettos of ‘Londonistan’, Paris, Brussels and Copenhagen! So, from the belly of the Euro beast, I urge the people of Iceland: stay free! Say ‘no’ to European Union! Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, the EU’s strategy for jobs sounds good, but the reality behind the scenes is very different. To take just one shocking example, the forthcoming trade agreement between the EU and India will have a devastating impact on Indian agriculture and pharmaceuticals. Indians are rightly worried by this threat to their prosperity and independence. But with the Indians giving up so much, we need to ask what is in it for Indian big business and what is it going to cost workers in Britain and Europe. The answer is Mode 4 immigration, which bypasses any national caps on immigration. Transnational corporations will gain the automatic right to bring in Indian labour to replace, for example, skilled British workers in steel and car plants and all the other industries now owned by Indian-based TNCs. The India-EU trade agreement will devastate the wages and employment prospects of hundreds of thousands of British and European workers. This is not a strategy for jobs but a naked sell-out to corporate greed. Nick Griffin  (NI

– A permanent shortage of organs for transplantation hampers the wonderful efforts of health care professionals to help patients. It is also a sad fact that there is a shortage of donors, and that this drives some vile criminal activities. To seek to address these problems by creating an EU-wide database is, however, a mistake. It is naive to place hopes in a database covering the whole of the EU, with all its different languages and IT systems, when the failed attempt to produce a Health Service database for the UK alone has wasted billions of pounds. Health services across Europe are unable even to fund basics, and face savage cuts as ordinary citizens pay for the bust of globalism. This being so, far more can be done to encourage organ donations by investing in education programmes at national levels, than by diverting funds to pay for well-intentioned bureaucratic meddling. Additionally, there are tight time constraints on organ viability. Thus, an EU-wide network would be of use to very few patients. Proposals to set one up are another pretty-sounding excuse for the further advance of an agenda that has nothing to do with patients’ welfare and everything to do with federalist dogma.

– Mr President, the most important priority of any budget should be only to spend your own money. Spending someone else’s without their permission is not budgeting, it is theft. British taxpayers are fleeced to the tune of GBP 6.4 billion in direct payments to the EU annually and we are still denied our referendum. Taking that money, without a democratic mandate, is not a victimless crime. Fifty thousand of our pensioners died of cold this winter because they could not afford to heat their own homes. Our soldiers are killed by Taliban bombs because we cannot afford blast-proof vehicles. Thousands of cancer victims are denied expensive life-saving drugs. GBP 6.4 billion would right all those wrongs and still leave change to build eight new hospitals and 50 schools. There should be only one budget priority – slash spending and stop robbing Britain. Our pensioners, soldiers and cancer victims need the money more than the EU. To you, it is a budget. To them, it is a matter of life or death. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Madam President, there is an English folk tale about King Canute who, by ordering the tide not to come in and wet his feet, showed his courtiers that not even kings are exempt from reality. In doing so, he became a byword for arrogant folly. King Canute lives on in the Council of the European Union, which begins and ends its conclusion on Arctic affairs with the alleged importance of global warming. This involves a refusal to accept scientific reality. According to the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre, Arctic summer ice has increased by 409 000 square miles, or 26%, since 2007. This is exactly what was predicted by scientists aware that the previous shrinkage of summer ice, wrongly used as evidence for global warming, was in fact nothing more than a snapshot of an ages-old natural cyclical pulse of advance, retreat and advance. So the Arctic summer ice will not vanish by 2013 and polar bears have not, and will not, drown because of global warming. But millions of hard-working voters are drowning in a sea of debt and taxes, and they are growing very impatient with the political class’s use of the global warming fraud to impose undemocratic international governance and bogus green taxes. The UN has now announced a review of the IPCC’s dodgy dossiers and fiddled statistics. On behalf of the taxpayers of Britain, I ask this Parliament to do the same and to stop wasting any more money on the most expensive big lie in human history. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, discussing tax cooperation during the current euro crisis is rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic
. The southern nations are known in English by the harsh acronym PIGS (Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain). However, those being crucified on the euro are not pigs but people, scourged by utopian one-size-fits-all dogma. Their economies will either die of a thousand cuts or be bailed out, to the ruin of taxpayers in Britain and elsewhere. There will be very little tax to cooperate over. There are two ways out: either abolish the euro and return to the captive nations of this Strawberry Soviet their own currencies, or expel the ‘problem countries’ from the euro. That might be the PIGS. More justly, it would be Germany and her French collaborator, because running the euro according to German interests is the root of this shambles. This endless crisis will destroy the federal project – tax cooperation and all. The tragedy is that it will grind so many innocent victims into poverty before it does so. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, after Copenhagen, let us reassess the whole global warming story. At Copenhagen, we had the irony of not just ‘Climategate II’, but also the onset of one of the harshest winters in decades. Since then, we have seen the debunking of the Potsdam sea-level scare; the Goddard Institute has been caught fiddling the temperature records; the vanishing Himalayan glaciers have been exposed as a fantasy; Mr Pachauri has emerged as a climate change profiteer. The world is cooling. Global warming is a fraud. This is not a victimless crime. Carbon taxes push up fuel prices, killing our old folk as we speak. The billions wasted researching this non-existent problem are billions that cannot be spent defeating real scourges such as Alzheimer’s, or ending real environmental disasters such as deforestation. Carbon credit trading makes billions for City sharks at the expense of families in poverty. The loss of agricultural land to biofuels has already doubled world food prices, so millions are starving while greedy corporations make even fatter profits. Those pushing the unscientific nonsense of man-made climate change – Shell, Monsanto, the international banks, Bilderberg one-worlders, carbon billionaires and their useful idiot allies on the left – are running the biggest fraud in human history. They must and will be called to account, as should their collaborators in places such as this. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, the horror of Haiti is shocking. It is only human to feel compassion for the innocent victims of the natural disaster there. All of us here are well paid and can afford to give. I will give my attendance allowance for today if every British MEP will do the same. However, with their taxes, our constituents cannot afford your generosity. Globalism has destroyed our industries. The banks have ruined our economies. EU red tape is strangling our entrepreneurs and the carbon-tax scam is plunging millions into deadly fuel poverty. The death toll in Haiti is shocking, but this winter, more than 50 000 pensioners in Britain alone will die premature deaths because of the cold and the cost of heating. Across Europe, the death toll will run into hundreds of thousands, but, because this truth shames the political elite and because it highlights the inconvenient truth of global cooling, this scandal will be buried as quietly as are our elderly dead. Hundreds of thousands of our own people are dying because of government neglect and EU cold taxes, yet you insist on throwing other people’s money at a disaster in somebody else’s back yard. That is not compassion: that is stinking hypocrisy. I know this place is uneasy with our Christian heritage, but as always, our Bible reveals an eternal truth that most here would rather ignore – first book of Timothy, 5:8: ‘but if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.’ Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, two months ago, my constituency was hit by disastrous floods. Deceitfully blamed on climate change, the real reason for the devastation of the town of Cockermouth was the EU-imposed privatisation/theft of public services. The proper management of reservoirs has been replaced by cost-cutting negligence by United Utilities, leading to safety margins being ignored and a panic-stricken decision to open sluice gates and release a man-made deluge on the town. The fact that only one brave man died in the floods was little short of miraculous, but such disasters will increase in frequency as more and more public services are looted by greedy corporations. Finally, my constituents are shocked that they will not receive a penny from the EU Solidarity Fund, because the UK cannot apply unless the damage exceeds EUR 3 billion. Since Britain is not in an earthquake zone, it is almost impossible to conceive of a disaster which would trigger such a payment, so British taxpayers – who contribute a disproportionate amount to the funds – have no realistic chance of benefiting from it. So much for solidarity. We want our money back! Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, everyone agrees that climate change is the biggest challenge facing humanity: that is the constant claim of the political elite, and it is a lie. Everyone does not agree. Thousands of scientists dispute the very existence of man-made global warming, citing natural cyclical changes that saw vineyards in Roman northern England and a Swedish army march over the frozen Baltic to Copenhagen in 1658. As an army of global-warming zealots marches to Copenhagen, the truth is that their Orwellian consensus is based not on scientific agreement, but on bullying, censorship and fraudulent statistics. In the words of leading climatologist Professor Lindzen, ‘Future generations will wonder in bemused amazement that the early 21st century’s developed world went into hysterical panic over a globally averaged temperature increase of a few tenths of a degree and, on the basis of gross exaggerations of highly uncertain computer projections [...], contemplated a rollback of the industrial age’. In fact, there will be no bemused amazement, for the reason for this hysteria is clear. It is designed to provide the excuse for a political project of the globalists to replace national democracy with new world order global governance. It has nothing to do with science and everything to do with the globalist common purpose to tax and control us, while making billions for corporations in the green industrial complex. The anti-Western intellectual cranks of the Left suffered a collective breakdown when Communism collapsed. Climate change is their new theology, a secular religious hysteria complete with Pope – Al Gore – carbon-credit indulgences and the persecution of heretics. But the heretics will have a voice in Copenhagen and the truth will out. Climate change is being used to impose an anti-human utopia as deadly as anything conceived by Stalin or Mao.

– Madam President, there is endless rhetoric here about friendship and cooperation between every state under the sun except for Russia. China commits genocide in Tibet. Turkey denies its Armenian holocaust. The USA flattens Iraq and this place fawns on them. But for Russia, there are only pompous and hypocritical lectures. This confrontational Russia phobia shamefully feeds the new Cold War drive of America’s warmongering neo-con lobby. Of course, there are some local differences between Russia and her neighbours, but can we not agree that next week’s summit should be used to attempt to build bridges and cooperation between the eastern and western halves of our civilisation? For historical and cultural reasons, this is far more practical and safer than attempting to create unity with Turkey, Europe’s ancient and eternal enemy. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Madam President, in the last two months, I have suffered victimisation by the UK Labour regime, including withdrawal of my House of Commons pass, refusal to allow me to enter the Sellafield nuclear processing plant – despite my position on a subcommittee of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – and the refusal of the Citizens’ Advice Bureau to sell me an information database openly advertised for sale to all other MEPs. Madam President, would you agree that political discrimination is not only unlawful but is also an attack not just on me, but also on the functionality of this place and, most important of all, on the voters and the entire democratic process? Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, there are two overriding themes in this place: first, concern with the growing gulf between the political elite and the ordinary taxpayers. Second, a hysterical obsession with man-made global warming. These two themes are intimately linked. The global-warming fixation is a classic example of how the political class here is out of touch with the little people who have to pay the bills. While the EU backs the Copenhagen proposals to further the deindustrialisation of the West and the corporate domination of the Third World, a growing majority of ordinary people regard climate change as an elite scam – an excuse to tax and control us and to impose internationalist dogma and global government at the expense of the nation state. Can you not see the danger in this growing gulf? It is time to look at the facts. Man-made global warming is an unproven theory based on manipulative statistics. The so-called consensus on the issue is the product not of debate but of the suppression of expert dissent. Before the political class and the green industrial complex dare to impose a single new tax, poisoned light bulb or useless wind farm on the ordinary taxpayer, they need to try to convince the public that global warming is
 man-made, that returning to the warmer climate of medieval times would be a bad thing and that there is something that Europe – as opposed to the United States, China and India – can actually do about it. Either hold a debate and close the gap between you and the people, or do not complain when we nationalists – the ones who listen to the people – close it for you. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, last year I served as a monitor at commemorations for the 1956 revolution in Budapest. I can confirm that Dr Morvai is right to criticise those who fret about Iran while ignoring human rights abuses here in Europe. I trust that no ECR Group members here will be hypocritical enough to condemn Iran for the use of violence in elections when David Cameron is among the sponsors of Unite Against Fascism, an organisation of far-left criminals which routinely deploys intimidation and violence against nationalist dissidents in Britain. The same is true of five current Labour, Lib Dem and Tory MEPs, marked with the shame of supporting the use of British taxpayers’ money to support their own militia, which breaks up opposition meetings and attacks their opponents with bricks, darts and claw hammers. But my main point is this: however well meaning, and even justified, criticisms of Iran made here may be, they will be exploited as war propaganda by the powerful vested interests that stand to gain from a military attack on that country. Neocons, oil companies, construction corporations and the Wahabi mullahs of Saudi Arabia all want to see the sovereign state of Iran destroyed by an aggressive war. Not even European liberals are naive enough to fall for lies about weapons of mass destruction again, so human rights are being drafted in as a new casus belli
. Do not add the voice of this place to the warmongers’ chorus for a third illegal and counterproductive attack by the West on the Muslim world. Or, if you must, do not leave the war – which hypocritical rhetoric will help to justify and unleash – to the usual brave British cannon fodder: 18-year-old boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne. Instead, send your own sons to come home in boxes or without their legs, their arms and their sanity – or mind your own business.Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, there is a principle in English civil law called ‘to one who is willing, no harm is done’. In other words, you cannot sue if you put yourself in danger of loss or injury. These illegal immigrants were not kidnapped in their own countries by wicked Europeans who then brought them to Europe and incarcerated them for eighteen months or more. They chose to enter an EU country illegally and then avoided being repatriated. Presumably they are free to return to their countries of origin, but refuse to do so. We have heard that illegal immigrants – those who do not leave – are usually given a piece of paper ordering them to leave, in order to avoid them disappearing. If their stay is a long one it is usually because of extensive court actions to avoid repatriation. While talking about a breach of the Returns Directive, we learned in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on 31 March that in 2012 only 37% of those given a return decision eventually left. The other 63% remained. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, we are hearing the 1914 language of self-righteous indignation to imply that one side is completely in the right and the others completely in the wrong. We might not like Mr Yanukovych – and there is much about him I do not like, if it is true – but his removal as President did not fall within the categories in Article 108 of the Constitution of Ukraine, and the procedure for impeachment in Article 111 was not followed. The civil disturbances in Ukraine were orchestrated from the EU when Yanukovych rejected the EU trade agreement. This was just as much interference in Ukraine, and with less justification, than anything that Russia has done. The taped conversation of Victoria Nuland and Geoffrey Pyatt about who should lead Ukraine was evidence of blatant US interference. It is all very well to call a referendum held by the Crimean Autonomous Republic illegal, but this was no more illegal than the removal of Mr[nbsp ]Yanukovych. Crimea had traditionally been part of Russia since the 18th Century, until 1954 when it was handed over by Mr Khrushchev, a Soviet leader of Ukrainian descent. The recent referendum was hurried and insufficiently debated, but the result was hardly ambiguous. Large powers, like Russia and the United States, have what they see as legitimate spheres of interest. The United States was not going to allow Soviet missiles in Cuba in 1962. Russia was not prepared to accept with equanimity a member of the EU and NATO within its traditional borders.

 Mr President, ‘own resources’ is a rather misleading euphemism. The EU has only the resources of its Member States, so their populations pay taxes perhaps more directly to the EU instead of through the treasuries of Member States. One of the purposes might be to disguise which countries are net contributors and which are net recipients, thus obviating the necessity for rebates and correction mechanisms and replacing them by a series of lump-sum payments over the next six years. You also remove from potentially rebellious Member States the power to threaten to withhold contributions from the EU. There is also a symbolic – or perhaps a psychological – significance of people paying taxes directly to the EU. It sends a subliminal message to taxpayers that the EU has the status of a state. How will own resources be enforced? By using officials and judges employed by Member States? Or perhaps new EU tax officials and courts will emerge, as though from nowhere.

 Mr President, the 2012 report of RAPEX reported that there had been a 26% increase in the number of alerts for dangerous products. This was not just the result of greater market surveillance, as the rapporteur said; the number of dangerous products really was increasing. Do we know the countries from which these products come? There have been some coded hints this morning, but only coded ones. On 20[nbsp ]January, we learnt from a debate on a proposed regulation for consumer protection that 58% of notifications for dangerous products related to goods from China, and that in a further 16% of cases it was not possible to identify the country of origin. Importation of cheap goods from emergent economies does not only undermine our manufacturing basis (and of course the jobs of our workers), it also has the potential for injuring our consumers. Freedom of movement of goods – not just within the EU, but globally – is the root cause of dangerous products in our markets. The EU is not so much a European Union, as it is becoming a global union.

 Madam President, EU legislation, unlike trade, does not extend beyond its borders, so it might not answer all the animal health needs of animals originating in third countries. This regulation would replace complex existing legislation and much of its substantive content would certainly be beneficial. Healthy farm animals are recognised as a prerequisite of human health. Whilst the rapporteur acknowledges that this is not primarily an animal protection law, she quotes with approval the description in a parallel regulation that animals are sentient beings and has written that the legislation protecting live animals when travelling should be amended to reflect distances travelled rather than just borders crossed. Sentient beings can feel pain and suffer from discomfort and fear. Ritualistic slaughter of animals without pre-stunning is self-evidently cruel treatment of a sentient being. Food from such an animal will not of course be a hazard to human health, but it will be a wound to civilised sensibilities. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, the nature-nurture debate used to be the most important in politics and was the key to a whole range of political views. The nurture side had much to be said for it – perceived kindness and fairness and, of course, non-discrimination. The nature side had only evidence to support it.  However, nurture now seems to have been declared the winner without a contest. Indeed, nature has been airbrushed out of the picture, even as a contestant. All public policies, whether devised by left, right, centrist or a populist safety valve, base their policies on a false assumption. They assume equal potential ability, which does no favours to those without it. They assume third world migrants can be substitute Europeans, when they only turn Europe into the third world. They confuse social mobility with equality of opportunity and do not realise that the latter will eventually bring the former to a shuddering halt. They throw money at continents that cannot benefit from it, because Europe takes their brightest and best. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, the External Action Service seeks to develop a common policy and only then persuade or cajole Member States to adhere to it. I am in favour of joint action, but only when it is necessary. This must be based on prior agreement on objectives and a genuine commonality of interests, not a shared desire for aggressive adventurism.  Paragraph[nbsp ]25 states that there is a strong link between development and conflict prevention. European States should therefore stop fomenting conflict in other countries that can cause devastating recession and dire poverty. Of course, the greatest reason for stagnation in the poorest of countries is a dearth of talent. This is made worse by northern countries looting what talent they have, generation after generation.

 Mr President, I am not an admirer of the Iranian Islamic Republic, but there are many repressive countries in the world and some of them are the West’s allies. Iran has been involved in only one war in recent decades, with Iraq. It is widely accepted that Iraq was the instigator of that conflict. I am afraid I cannot judge whether Iran has only a civil nuclear programme, but the claims about Iraq proved to be unfounded.  There is a certain irony in the fact that many of Iran’s critics, the United States and Israel among them, have been involved in conflicts in the past and have nuclear weapons. I am sceptical about the foreign policy priorities of the United States, though I must say the present administration is showing more restraint than its republican predecessor. I am no supporter of the European External Action Service or of the position of High Representative. However, if an agreement between the United States and Iran, encouraged by Baroness Ashton, prevents conflict and normalises relations it, and she, must be applauded. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, to find out what a meeting is about, it is sometimes necessary to put together different sources as though they were pieces in an intricate jigsaw. The agenda of the forthcoming meeting refers to the European Semester which, among other things, includes inspection by the Commission of reform programmes, including reforms of the labour market. The agenda also mentions industrial competitiveness and the importance of a strong and competitive industrial base as a driver for economic growth and jobs. If we refer back to a meeting of ECOFIN, held on 16[nbsp ]February[nbsp ]2012, about the European Semester of that year, we find that ‘reforms need to focus on labour markets – in particular wage-setting mechanisms – to ensure efficient adjustment of labour costs’. What does all this mean? It means that a relatively high-wage economy, or group of economies, embracing the ideology of globalism and the process of globalisation, must drive down wages to compete with the emergent economies.

 Mr President, the present crisis in Ukraine did not start with a Russian invasion. It started with the EU’s reaction to Ukraine’s rejection of the EU-Ukrainian trade deal. This reaction took the form of the EU’s friends in that country exploiting Ukrainian nationalists to provide paramilitary assistance on the streets. I am no supporter of Mr Yanukovych, of his political or personal background or his tactics against demonstrators. However, the Ukrainian Parliament does not have the power simply to remove the president under Article 108, and it does not appear that the impeachment procedures under Article 111 were followed. The EU is determined to ensnare Ukraine by bribery and intimidation. I certainly do not view the presence of Russian troops in the Ukraine with equanimity; I would like them to withdraw. However, Russia is reacting to extreme acts of provocation, not just by the EU but also the US. We know this … (The President cut off the speaker) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, Mr Cercas’s report explains succinctly the formula being applied to the countries investigated: wage freezes and cuts, cuts in welfare spending, part-time and temporary work, and involuntary emigration. It then leaps to three laudable objectives: increased employment, reduction in poverty and reduction in school drop-out rates. It quite rightly calls for an end to austerity. You do not make people richer or reduce their indebtedness by making them poorer. However, its other recommendations lack substance or definition and amount to a prayer for things to improve. It shies away from the root cause: the fact that the euro’s value is too high for their economies. Only withdrawal from the eurozone and a reintroduction of their national currencies, which will fall in value, will allow them to enjoy export-led expansions. The austerity programmes were designed to save the eurozone; they were not designed to help the four countries concerned. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, I am not an EU enthusiast at all, and I can see even less justification for the EU to facilitate investment in countries beyond its borders. In the case of countries in Eastern Europe, I suppose it can be seen as a bribe to lure them into becoming candidate countries and surrendering their sovereignty. North African countries, of course, are not eligible to be members, at least under present rules, but their receipt of investment is a sign that the EU is not so much a European Union as a global union in waiting. There will undoubtedly be people in the still-crisis-ridden states of the South who wonder why all such available money is not being invested there. The answer might be that investment will be less effective in those countries when expansion is constrained by a currency that is overvalued for their economies. Indeed, withdrawal from the eurozone for those countries would be a prerequisite for effective investment. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, the existence of the EIB is justified on the grounds of perceived need. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) bemoans the fact that there was a lack of sustainable and viable projects that were eligible for EIB funding. It appears that the EIB criteria did not match the investment need. There is certainly a need for investment in infrastructure in the Member States. However, investment can be carried out more cheaply, more efficiently and in a more targeted way by those Member States creating the credit themselves rather than borrowing from external institutions and adding sovereign debt. The principle of ‘what is physically possible must be financially possible’ should be followed. President Obama, no less, when introducing the American Jobs Act, said it was a contradiction for a bridge in Maine to be in need of repair while construction workers were unemployed. However, the resolution of that contradiction seems to have eluded him. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, the explanatory memorandum in Ms[nbsp ]Zuberʼs report says that the effects of austerity in Greece, Ireland, Portugal and elsewhere are that women are suffering disproportionately, but of course all workers are suffering from those measures, not just women. The urgent need is to end the austerity programmes she refers to, and membership of the euro area which is the thing that they are supposed to sustain. When those countries benefit from an export-led expansion following withdrawal from the euro area, there will indeed be prosperity to be divided fairly between men and women, which must happen. To seek to divide austerity fairly is to exonerate its architects from responsibility and distract attention from the cause of their suffering. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, in my first debate in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) five years ago, a noblewoman of Liberal persuasion convinced herself that I did not know the difference between people travelling with or without a visa, on the one hand, and immigrants on the other. I think that I remarked that I did know the difference but sometimes the travellers did not.  People who travel from poor countries to relatively rich ones are not always scrupulously honest about their purposes for, or the intended length of, their visit. In a recent debate in LIBE, a representative of the Commission warned against confusing visa facilitation and visa liberalisation and said that easing the procedure for obtaining the visa, as distinct from waiving it, would not allow the visa holder to overstay. The visa overstayer, he implied, would be waiting in the place he was supposed to have been for the authorities to collect him and return him to his own country.  I have heard the Commission accused of many things but I did not think that naivety was among them. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, in the eyes of the EU all rights are equal but some are more equal than others. In any democracy the political rights – freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and electoral rights – should be pre-eminent. Why? Because they are the key to all the others: their recognition, their extent and their limitations. Indeed many of the personal rights were established only with the exercise of these political rights. However, the EU regards the personal rights – chosen or determined behaviour, freedom from constraint, prohibition of discrimination, freedom of movement – to be paramount. If there should be a conflict between, say, freedom of expression and one of these personal rights, freedom of expression would be the loser. What they are really saying is that the political rights were simply vehicles for campaigning for their range of personal rights. Once these have been elevated to the status of having self-evident virtue, the political rights have served their use and have become redundant. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, this report starts innocently enough by referring to conditions of entry for ostensibly short-term visitors, such as exchange pupils or au[nbsp ]pairs. Then the pretences are cast aside and it admits that it is just a prelude to large-scale permanent immigration, eleven million in the current decade. Why? The pretext is Europe’s ageing population caused, in part, by women’s enslavement to economic forces and subservience to anti-family propaganda. The report envisages ‘third-country’, for which you can often read Third World, immigrants with their large families becoming replacement Europeans. Well, they won’t. They will continue to turn more and more parts of Europe into the Third World. You cannot change a person’s identity by changing his or her country or continent of residence. Furthermore, you do not help poorer countries by robbing them of their most skilled and able workers.

... long list of occupations here, they are not just students and researchers, but in fact the following paragraph mentions quite separately that Europe today has an ageing population and needs immigration.

 Madam President, when the history of the 21st century is written it could be remembered as the one in which Europeans were ethnically cleansed from large parts of their homelands. Within my lifetime large parts of the cities of many countries in the West have been transformed into outposts of Africa and Asia. By the end of the century the East will probably be transformed in the same way.  Now it has not happened autonomously like the wind and tides; it has been brought about deliberately by the people who misrule us: the political class. When the peoples of Europe are no longer the pre-eminent populations our distinctive culture will be no more. Distinctive peoples are not the product of distinctive cultures; distinctive cultures are the product of distinctive peoples. Demographic change is not just about numbers and space. It is about the identities of the peoples doing the replacing and the people being replaced. There is still time for Europeans nationally, and in cooperation, to alter their destiny and take control of their own future. It will require moral courage, determination and resolution.

 Mr President, if you start with the premise that admitting seasonal workers was an economic necessity and would happen anyway, there might be something to be said for at least part of this report. The conditions of work of the seasonal workers in Rosarno, where we went in 2010, were truly appalling. Allowing those sorts of conditions, wages and accommodation to be tolerated would be inhumane and would encourage employers to hire third-country workers before home or EU workers. However, allowing third-country workers to apply from within the EU for seasonal work would reward illegal migrants and encourage the entry of more. Allowing people admitted for another purpose to apply would invite abuse of the admission system.  Nine to twelve months is more than a season. I should like to see the evidence for the conclusion that national and other EU workers would be unwilling to take seasonal work. Many long-term unemployed would be pleased to have paid work with accommodation provided in their own country, or at least in their own continent. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, the ethnic and religious conflict is obviously the most pressing problem, but in a way it distracts us from the underlying long-term problems of poverty, a lack of economic development and a fragile civic infrastructure. We must understand the nature of these problems if they are to be solved.  Now these problems are not just the product of the decades following independence or, for that matter, of the colonial experience. Despite being rich in natural resources and having favourable agricultural conditions, the CAR is one of the world’s poorest countries. We might ask why the area of the Central African Republic, and the rest of sub-Saharan Africa for that matter, did not develop the instruments of technology and transport and use them to spread the fruits of their discoveries, learning and creativity throughout the world in the way that Europe did. If there has been, and continues to be, a hindrance to development it must be identified and addressed. When we address that question honestly we might be ready to start solving Africa’s problems.

 Mr President, insider dealing and market manipulation are undoubtedly wrong and harm countless numbers of people. They are not victimless crimes and should be subject to criminal sanctions. The argument is that when a market becomes international, the regulation must also become international. From that it is concluded that EU legislation is called for – surprise, surprise. There is a slight flaw in the logic or at least in one of the premises. The terms EU and international are not synonymous. What is required is an international treaty, signed by all significant trading countries, to the effect that the signatory countries will legislate for stated minimum standards of legislation. In this example, as in many others, EU harmonising legislation is the objective and the prevention of insider dealer and market manipulation is simply the pretext. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, if you start from a position of 28 countries locked into the EU, and all of them locked into the global trade system governed by the World Trade Organisation, you might be forgiven for thinking that there was some merit in the Commission’s proposal, for example, to modify the lesser duty rule, or to impose provisional duties after establishing proof of what even the EU would consider to be dumping. However, I am tempted to take the part of the man in the joke who, when asked for directions, replied: ‘I would not have started from here.’  I am opposed to EU controls over my country’s ability to manage its own trade. However, I am even more concerned about the EU and the WTO facilitating trade with low-wage economies with whose manufactured goods we cannot possibly compete, and which constitute dumping, without any investigation being necessary.

 Mr President, for a tax to attract one or two non-partisan critics would be unfortunate. To attract dozens sounds a bit like carelessness. The tax is superficially appealing as a levy on institutions blamed for the recession: a tax on the rich to benefit the poor. But, as one critic said: banks simply pass down their taxes to us, the customers. Indeed, the FTT would be levied most heavily on long-term investments such as those of pension funds. The good news is that it will be levied in only eleven countries. The bad news is that it might be drafted in a way that would catch some transactions in countries that have rejected it.  There is reason to believe that its imposition, even at a modest level, would lead to the migration of funds to countries beyond those participating in it. If it were ever to be imposed on all 28 Member States, funds would migrate to New York and elsewhere. Remember: the FTT is the chosen instrument to be an EU own-resources tax.

 Mr President, I am not in favour of freedom of movement, in principle: sovereign states should be able to admit, or refuse to admit, whom they wish. When it applies between countries with widely different wage levels, it leaves the source country devoid of valuable labour and the destination country with home workers jobless.  But the problem is aggravated when third-country citizens abuse the procedure by gaining access using forged and stolen documents, sham marriages and even proxy marriages. We are told that the procedure for authenticating documents is time-consuming and troublesome. It needs to be. The British Home Secretary submitted a document showing the extent of the fraud to the Commission in December, but it is yet to be revealed to the public. The report sees freedom of movement to be not just a right, but an expectation. Those promoting it are trying to eradicate national identity and, by encouraging third-party or third-country nationals, they are seeking to eradicate the identity of Europe too.

 Madam President, the cause of homelessness, which is unmentionable by the silent conspiracy of liberal consensus, is immigration and asylum. Every person or family entering a country adds to the demand for housing by one. If there are homeless among the indigenous population, a house provided for a new arrival is a house denied to an existing resident. The decision-takers – MEPs, MPs, local councillors – are not among the homeless. Indeed, most of them cannot count any homeless among their circle of acquaintances. To them, the homeless are just statistics and not real people. Decision-takers feel terribly generous for granting a home to a newcomer, but funnily enough they do not feel mean for denying one to an existing resident. We heard this morning from UKIP that it was opposed to mass immigration. However, its leader said recently ‘we want immigration, we welcome immigration’.

Mr Farage recently said that Bulgarians and Romanians were responsible for a lot of crime in London.

Mr President, the Lithuanian Presidency claims credit for progress on the Banking Union and enhanced EU control over the economies of Member States, especially those in the eurozone, as though these were simply means of achieving economic well-being. However, these are not a means to an end, but rather an end in itself: centralised control of Member States. The Presidency has boasted of its achievements on hate crime, which properly refers to criminal acts, violence, abuse and property damage motivated by hatred of a particular category of people, and should always be deplored. Hatred is always destructive of the hater as well as the hated. However, assaults and extreme violence and damage motivated by hatred and contempt are not perpetrated only – or even mainly – by the indigenous populations of Europe against ethnic minorities, as we know from the cases of Lee Rigby in London, those of Kriss Donald and Richard Everitt, the London riots in 2011 and the countless victims of Asian grooming. Lithuania boasts of hosting a conference in November of the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), which believes in the criminalisation of disapproved expressions of opinion on ethnicity, including racism – a word undefined but coined by Trotsky – and xenophobia, which can only be described as an Orwellian thought crime. Ironically, the application of these words to political opponents – a favourite activity of the FRA and Eurocrats – is a subliminal message of hatred: stop reading, stop listening, stop judging for yourself; hate the speaker, hate the writer.

 Mr President, given that national legislation is insufficient, this proposal is ostensibly to protect consumers. Yet the more you read, the more you realise that consumer protection is not wanted primarily for its own sake but because it will facilitate free trade. It seems that cutting the budget would not be acceptable. No surprise there! In the context of product safety, the report does contain some interesting revelations. In 2010, 58 % of notifications were in respect of goods from China, and in 16 % of cases it was not possible to identify the country of the manufacturer. Alarmingly, 25 % of notifications concerned toys. The drive to extend free trade worldwide without regard for the job security of Europeans is well documented. However, it seems that consumer safety has also been a victim of international free trade. The countries of Europe, individually or collectively, cannot deal with countries that habitually sell us unsafe or substandard goods. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, I am not reassured that this proposal is not protectionist, because that is exactly what it ought to be. The countries of Europe, individually or collectively, ought to protect their jobs and their businesses. The question which has not been asked is whether it is in the interests of any country or trading bloc, if you will, to open its public procurement market to other countries or blocs. Public expenditure is ultimately funded by domestic taxes, but if it generates economic activity – and it does – it should be for the benefit of that country or those countries’ own peoples. The report confirms that market access by companies from third countries is part of the common commercial policy which falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The EU’s wish to maximise international access to these markets shows that the EU is not so much a European Union as a global union in waiting. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr Farage, you claim – or you imply – that you are against immigration. On 4 May 2010, on the Daily Politics show, you said that Britain should issue 250 000 work permits each year.

 Mr President, yes, the Commission wants to see more single market competition for defence procurement on the ground that fragmented markets create red tape and duplication of defence programmes. It is not fragmentation that leads to red tape; it is the EU requirement that defence contracts should be put out to tender.  Britain could, of course ironically, use the Lisbon Treaty to avoid tendering on the ground of protecting its national interest, as Poland has done to its great credit. The Commission will tackle what it calls market distortions, which will probably take away the rights of Member States to protect their national interest in this area. Defence is too important to the national interest to allow free market competition.  Whilst another European war is, we all hope, unthinkable, our world interests might diverge; the UK cannot be dependent for equipment procurement on states opposed, say, to our protecting the Falklands from Argentinian aggression.

Mr President, in paragraph 13 the rapporteurs express their dislike of Member States excluding themselves from treaties or legislation from the outset, and would prefer legislation to allow for derogations later. This effectively makes the default position that all treaties and legislation should apply to all Member States unless they negotiate an opt-out and only, of course, for as long as they retain it. However, the express disapproval of derogations is intended to make them an exceptional and shameful procedure for which Member States should feel properly contrite. This means that agreements and legislation concerning the euro and instruments to serve it will apply to Britain and other non-euro countries unless they and Britain ask for a derogation: in other words, control of our economy unless the government asks for an opt-out. This would allow Member State governments that are indolent, or perhaps less eurosceptic than they pretend to be, to extend the EU’s control…  (The President cut off the speaker) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, it is tempting to applaud the proposals for increasing the power of Parliament and increasing the accountability of the President of the European Council to it. Equally, it is easy to deprecate the behaviour of the European Council in trying to extend its role. If I were an enthusiast for the EU project, I would succumb to both temptations. However, I am not so I shall not. Do I look at the European Council through rose-tinted spectacles? No. My view of some of their members might involve unparliamentary language. However, whatever I think of particular members of the European Council, its members represent Member States and are ultimately responsible to their electorates and removable by them. The Parliament, whatever its merits, is not responsible to a single electorate with a consciousness of its identity so it cannot take a conscious collective decision as to the choice of Commission President. Indeed its decision will look like the decision of a Ouija board. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the general objective of the programme is to develop further mutual recognition by promoting judicial cooperation in criminal and civil matters. It all sounds rather splendid until, of course, the difficulties are examined. There are enormous differences in substantive law and trial procedure between Member States, and even within them. However, there are also differences in legal culture between the common law and continental systems, with particular reference to freedoms to act. The starting presumption in common law is that persons have the freedom to do whatever is not prohibited by law. The starting position in many continental countries is that rights are created by proclamation and can be easily defined. Whilst even in common law systems they can be defined negatively and repressively, the jury system is a safeguard against legislation and prosecutions that are considered to be unreasonable. We can see how this difference manifests itself in practice: many continental countries restrict freedom of expression in an extreme, obsessive and quite insane way. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, we have the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide but toleration of political repression at home in the EU, selective registration of European parties, party bans and attempted bans on fabricated evidence, the arrest of opposition MPs on trumped-up charges, prosecution meaning even imprisonment for heretical opinion, and even thought crime. Can democracy and human rights be implanted and nurtured even in unpromising soil? It is difficult to prevent it from being corrupted and undermined even in its ancestral home.  Countries with strong vertical divisions have difficulty in making it work. In countries with inflexible and intolerant religious ideologies, democracy can bring social repression for women and religious minorities. It is often thought that social liberalism and observance of human rights complement democracy. However, sometimes politically repressive regimes are socially liberal. There are indispensable social preconditions for democracy to develop and survive but they cannot be bought and paid for from outside. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the long-term prospects for British fishermen depend on withdrawal from the EU, but of course fishermen want solutions to current and immediate problems. We are told that the discard policy involving fish that cannot survive will of course be discontinued, but the survivability rate is said to be higher with some species. There must be research-led distinctions between treatment of different species. Avoidance of by-catch waste is a welcome theme of the Stevenson report, with adult commercial fish to be allowed onto the open market and the remaining by-catch being used for some other commercial purpose: fish meal, pet food, etc. In the end, by-catches must be reduced, possibly with gear that distinguishes between different sizes for selective catch and release, such as the pot-trap developed by my constituent Mr Jeff Stockdale in 2009. Information to consumers is always to be welcomed but the original requirements for gear type, fish stock and flag state might have been excessively costly. That the supply of this information will be voluntary is to be welcomed. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, some in my country would say that Britain in the EU is not British enough, and they would be right. But I would say that the European Union is not European enough. The immigration policies of Western Member States and the embryonic EU policy have brought third world populations to Europe and have turned parts of Europe into the third world. Identities are the product of ancestry and history, not of culture or legal contrivance. The EU does not have a European economic protectionist policy. It has a globalist policy designed to move by gradual degrees to a world economy with a common wage level and standard of living. There are genuine Europhiles, but the Eurocrats are not among them. They are cosmopolitans. Ironically, the main media-created, pretend Eurosceptic party in the UK is in favour of a quarter of a million immigrants each year and embraces globalism and global free trade.

 Mr President, agriculture is unlike any other industry because of the inelasticity of its demand and supply. That makes public-sector support absolutely indispensable. But that support ought to be Member State support and not EU support. The UK receives the smallest share of common agricultural policy funding of any Member State. The EU’s embrace of neo-liberalism opens the door to trade agreements that force Europe’s farmers to face dangerous competition. That same philosophy allows supermarkets to treat farmers as though they were their own outworkers. The multitude of farmers face the tyranny of few buyers, which is a classic example of what an economist would call an oligopsony. We have been warned about a re-nationalisation of agricultural policy. If only that were the case! What we need is abolition of the CAP, not its reform. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, money by itself does not produce intellectual inspiration. That is to be found in what a Commission 2020 document described as a ‘talented and creative populationʼ. That is Europeans, if you were wondering. Indeed, a disproportionately large number of inventions and innovations come from Europe in general, and from a country that modesty prevents me from mentioning in particular. Perhaps ensuring the survival of those talented populations from the replacement from which they are now suffering would be the best way of encouraging and nurturing inventiveness. There are some other populations in the world that have been most cruelly deprived of their fair share of those gifts. Does the public sector, preferably at Member State level, have a role to play? Historically, neither inventions nor innovations receive public funds. However, subsidies are contagious and countries and trading blocs that need to compete must match the subsidies of their rivals. Will research and development ensure that we can compete? Not if the wage levels of competitors are a fraction of our own, or if the elite talent of our competitors is to copy our innovations in breach of patent rights. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the report on the interinstitutional agreement is highly critical of the length of the negotiations within the Council and between the institutions. But the money that is the subject of negotiation is taxpayers’ money, and its expenditure must be given due consideration. The rapporteur is keen that Parliament’s legislative and budgetary powers granted by the Treaty of Lisbon should be fully respected. The report is critical of the Council for binding itself to the conclusions of the European Council.  It is true that Parliament is the only directly elected body and it seems at first sight right that it should be pre-eminent in the budgetary process. However, most of the money spent by the EU comes from or through Member States, and Member States’ governments are, in the eyes of their electorates, held responsible to their electorates for their taxpayers’ money. Parliament might be constitutionally responsible to a theoretical European electorate, but that electorate is not conscious even of its own existence as an entity. There is little dialogue between MEPs and their electors about the precise allocation of funds as distinct from the total amount.  The European Council – unlike the Council – does not have an official legislative role, but as the body representing Heads of Government its members are much more aware of the views of their citizens on expenditure than are MEPs. For as long as the EU continues they must have an important say in the negotiating process. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, this agenda is a distraction from the real causes of unemployment and the lack of growth. They include restrictive budgetary policies, cheap foreign imports from emergent economies, domestic earned income being invested abroad, and the outsourcing of jobs. But the cause of unemployment which is the real taboo is immigration, especially immigration from the Third World. Their migrants are assisted by anti-discrimination laws, while what we really need are native population preference laws, so that each country’s nationals could go to the top of the employment list. Immigration should be on the agenda as one of the causes of unemployment. In the UK, we have an establishment safety-valve party that would pretend to be opposed to mass immigration, but on 4 May 2010, its leader, Mr Farage, said that the UK should issue a quarter of a million work permits each year.

Mr President, I am sure that the High Representative will be believed when she says she wants to promote democracy and the rule of law throughout the world. I am not an enthusiast for her position, but she rightly challenges and criticises countries that imprison opposition leaders on spurious or doubtful pretexts. Of course, this does not just take place in former Soviet Republics or unstable regimes of the Middle East or Africa; it can also happen in Member States. Only a few weeks ago we saw several MP’s of Greece’s third-strongest party arrested and detained on a ‘sovietesque’ charge of founding a criminal organisation. They are not, apparently, charged with complicity in the despicable murder of a left-wing activist, but their party has been transformed into a criminal organisation over night. I know nothing directly about Golden Dawn, and I certainly do not look at them through rose-tinted spectacles. But the rule of law cannot be observed selectively.

 Mr President, if the EU needs to know whether the single market has been a success, it need only look at organised crime. The removal of international borders and visa-free travel make detection much less likely. The creation of a single currency could have been invented by money launderers – possibly it was. Of course, money laundering is not always obviously a cross-border activity. The UK is full of micro and small businesses which deal with cash customers and survive only by divine providence. Indeed, the hand of God – or at least one of his alternatives – must be responsible, because the tiny number of customers they have could not sustain them. The products that they sell in limited quantities are varieties of fast food and taxi rides. The trafficked products and people that they sell on a grander and more profitable scale are the products and services that dare not speak their name. Organised crime is a real problem, and this report has some merit. But it is being used to justify yet more EU centralisation and control, more harmonisation and, of course, use of the EU’s public prosecutor’s office. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, the rapporteur protests in this document that there is no protectionist aim whatsoever, as though the word ‘protectionist’ might be one of those hate labels – like ‘racist’ – that are so popular with cosmopolitans. The rapporteur is using the word ‘protectionist’ in its strict economic sense, referring to tariff and non-tariff barriers to international trade. However, if he had been using it in a more general and everyday sense, his denial would be equally valid. The EU is emphatically not trying to protect Europe’s interests, still less the interests of its Member States. The objective is to follow the World Trade Organisation’s globalist agenda. Retaliation would not be used to protect Europe’s economic interests but to enforce observance of the WTO’s globalist rules. The theory of international trade is that unrestricted trade makes the world as a whole richer. However, even if that were always the case, it would not follow that it made everybody or every country richer too. The free movement of goods and services, capital and labour – which is of course what all globalists, including EU globalists, are driving for – can only work if prices and wages are on undifferentiated scales. If that happens, the developed world, including Europe, has everything to lose. The third world and emergent economies have everything to gain.

The alternative would be that Member States reverted to being sovereign countries and were capable of controlling trade as they wished, but a second best would at least be that Europe looked after Europe’s interests and did not try to drive towards a global free trade area.

Mr President, we have heard from the Commissioner that there ought to be respect for the rule of law in Russia, that people should not be condemned without a distinct breach of the law established by the ordinary courts. But we heard only yesterday from the Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, no less, that people accused of an undoubtedly horrific murder in Greece could be regarded as guilty before any trial. Even people perceived as being beyond the pale must be treated with respect for the rule of law.  Before we point the finger at Russia, Members of this Parliament should look into their own conduct. We have heard that Russia is restricting freedom of expression. If it is, that will be reprehensible. However, many EU Member States lock people up for expressing opinions that do not have any hint of violence. Indeed, Commissioner Reding would like to go further and criminalise thought crime. I am sure that many Members here have been speaking honesty and from the heart, but I believe that behind this debate is an agenda that has got very little to do with sexuality or freedom of expression: it is about Russia’s foreign policy.

 You have used that word ‘extremism’ several times. Do you not think the Belgian government that banned Vlaams Blok was an extremist government? The German government that used fabricated evidence to try to ban a political party, is that not an extremist party? What about Commissar Reding who wants to imprison people for expressing opinions? Is she not an extremist? Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, the loss of life among illegal migrants in the Mediterranean is of course an appalling tragedy. Improving the rapidity of response to accidents is necessary, but of course is only part of the solution. The main answer is to remove the incentive for them to travel to Europe. We must replace the policy of allowing most of these people to stay with a policy of allowing none of them to stay. When that message gets through to would-be migrants, they will stop taking the risk. Repatriation of illegals really will save lives. The architects of the EU asylum policies, including people in this House, are directly and personally responsible for deaths in the Mediterranean. They should really hang their heads in shame. The logical extension of non-refoulement is a recipe for allowing all Third World illegal migrants to stay. Of course, the real unspoken migratory policy of the EU is to cleanse ethnically the indigenous populations of Europe and replace them with people from the Third World. When that happens, parts of Europe become outposts of the Third World. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, investment, in its simplest form, is the deferral of present consumption in order to facilitate production that will enable greater enrichment in the future. If the people deferring present consumption are the ones to benefit from the future enrichment, all is well and good. However, if the deferred consumption is used to facilitate more efficient production and greater enrichment elsewhere, there has been a mismatch.  That sums up the investment relationship between European countries and China. Europe invests nearly seven times as much in China as China does in Europe. Europe is deferring current consumption to make China a more efficient producer and – of course – competitor. Most of the arguments about trade with and investment in and from China have concentrated on the level playing field argument: a removal of tariff barriers, getting China to improve working conditions, paying attention to environmental concerns and ending counterfeiting. No attention has been paid to the question of whether we should be helping a potentially enormous emerging economy to compete with the developed world for scarce resources, compete with our industries and, possibly, direct its newfound industrial wealth into even greater military capability. The West insists on being globalist – to its own detriment – when dealing with China which, whatever its lip service to Marxist rhetoric, is in fact an economic nationalist state. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, the EU has a trade deficit with Taiwan but it has a surplus in services. The UK has a substantial trade deficit with Taiwan, a ratio of almost 3:1, which has undermined and is continuing to undermine British industry. Our surplus in services is diminishing year by year. UK investment in Taiwan dwarfs Taiwan’s investment in Britain by a factor of almost 4:1. Thus British capital, deferred consumption if you like, is financing competition from Taiwan. Furthermore, that country is investing in low-wage economies in the Far East that will also compete with all of our industries.  The rapporteurs are not commending trade with Taiwan pragmatically because it benefits the EU: they commend it because it advances the WTO objective of open trade worldwide. The EU is not pursuing European objectives, but global objectives. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, MPs must not be above the law, especially if they are implicated in crimes of violence. However, the arrest of six Greek MPs, including their party leader, at the behest of the government, only days after violent protests against their party by left-wing demonstrators following the horrific stabbing of a left-wing activist, must give us cause for concern We must think of what Pastor Martin Niemöller might have said: ‘First they came for Golden Dawn, and I did not speak out because it was not my party.’ These were the first arrests of MPs in Greece since the fall of the infamous Colonels’ dictatorship in 1974. Whatever we might think of that party, no evidence has been cited of a connection between the alleged murderer and the MPs and it appears that the arrests took place to assuage the anger of violent demonstrators. I am sure that, if the Hungarian Government had imprisoned opposition MPs instead of just tinkering with the constitution, we would have held non-stop debates. Democratic rights are not to be granted or withheld at the whim of government. We must always be sceptical when governments imprison oppositions. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, we are used to the EU using the crisis as a pretext for greater integration of Member States’ economies: it is now being used as a pretext for pooling defence industries and capabilities. Apparently, surrender of the ability to take independent action is a panacea for all ills. Sovereign states that lose their own capabilities and defence industries cease to be sovereign. Supranational bodies that gain a capacity to wage war without the express consent of member countries become, by stealth, sovereign states. But of course that is the idea. The report seems to look back at previous involvement in conflicts with a degree of nostalgia and bemoans the fact that the EU does not have a clear common security and defence policy. It refers with approval to the 2008 European Council meeting at which the objective was set to be capable of deploying a force of 60 000 in 60 days. I am afraid I cannot be sanguine about the possibility of a trigger-happy EU deploying an army of that size. Alliances such as the EU mutual defence clause have the potential for transforming a localised conflict into a world war. If we doubt it, think of 1914. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, unemployment is caused by a single currency that is overvalued for the countries of the South where youth unemployment is at its highest. It is caused by high energy costs because of the EU’s mad dash for renewables. The EU’s energy costs are between twice and four times those of the United States. It is also caused by the EU’s embrace of globalisation and unlimited trade with low-wage economies. Last but not least, it is caused by unrestricted immigration.  Mr Nuttall’s hypocrisy on this was astounding. UKIP’s leader, Mr Farage, has advocated 250 000 work permits to be issued by the UK every year. UKIP is a pro-immigration party like all of the others that have expressed pretended and very recent concerns about it. Youth unemployment is particularly significant because it is even more difficult to find a new job than it is to hold on to an existing one. However, its causes and solutions are not qualitatively different. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, whilst this might not yet apply to the UK, there are issues of wider concern. The substantive content of the proposal is completely sound. Suspects should indeed enjoy access to a lawyer as well as the other rights listed. However, in my view, there is no need for EU legislation, and indeed such legislation would not satisfy the need completely. The EU is not – not yet at least – the whole world and people travelling internationally do not restrict their visits to other Member States. What is needed is not EU legislation but an international treaty encompassing as many countries as possible throughout the world, to the effect that the rights listed should apply with reciprocity to all countries that are signatories. I cannot help feeling that this proposal is not so much about the rights of the suspect, with EU legislation being the means. It is much more about extending EU legislation competence and the rights of the suspect are simply a means to an end. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, this Presidency will be even more inspired by the EU and less by the presiding country because unusually the key player will be the President rather than the Prime Minister. Why? Because the President is a former commissioner with an EU mindset. There will be more of the same: single market, banking union, neo-liberal global free trade, talk about growth and unemployment without considering the conditions for the first or the causes of the second. The Eastern Partnership is of particular interest. We are told that the politically inspired prosecution of Yulia Tymoshenko has affected relations with Ukraine. I look forward to the politically inspired prosecution of Marine Le Pen affecting relations with France.  The most important players in the EU project are invited to Bilderberg conferences. I wonder whether the Lithuanian President was invited this year. If not, why not? I think we should be told. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, there is sometimes a presumption that if we have done nothing wrong, we have nothing to fear from surveillance. However, there is evidence that security services collect political information that is not concerned with the committing of criminal offences. Sometimes they collect personal information unconnected with politics – perhaps to create leverage over individuals. Furthermore, they do not only collect information but also sometimes engage in disruptive action on the basis of that information. We know all of this from the revelations in 2011 about the activities of a British police officer, Mark Kennedy, who infiltrated Green protest groups. Some states – the United Kingdom is a particular example – practise formal and systematic discrimination against members of named political parties. A Merseyside police officer lost his career in 2009 as the result of alleged membership of a perfectly legal but heretical political party. I will stop there. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI
). -  
Mr President, increased mobility is not so much a cure for youth unemployment as it is a cause, at least in the West. Unemployment in the South is caused directly by a euro that is over-valued for those countries, but the European Council is determined to keep on expanding the zone. The European Council wants to improve growth and competitiveness, but the EU’s energy policy pushes up energy costs, making industry less competitive. It even provides incentives for manufacturers like Corus near Middlesbrough to move production to India. Immigration – two thirds of it from outside the EU in the case of the UK – is giving our jobs to people from outside. Increasing globalism will make industry in the EU try unsuccessfully to compete with emergent economies. The European Council does not so much have a cure for the recession, it is part of the problem. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the authors of this report seem not to appreciate the irony of their calls for restrictions on freedom of speech in protection of fundamental rights. To justify themselves, they use the emotive term ‘hate speech’. Hatred is an ugly word because it is an ugly concept.  We know from the experience of France how low the threshold can be. The mere careless choice of words, such as ‘detail’ or ‘debate’, can land you in court. The FN presidential candidate in 2012 is now being prosecuted for drawing parallels between military and migratory occupation. Has Hungary, under the present government, prosecuted any opposition, presidential or other candidates? Has Hungary banned any political parties, as Belgium did in 2004? Has it attempted to ban a political party using evidence fabricated by the security services, as Germany did in 2001? Has Hungary, under the present government, acted like its predecessor in 2006 and sent armed police to attack peaceful demonstrators? Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, bonuses awarded in the fund management sector are certainly high. It is difficult to justify them morally and it is always tempting to want to do something about them. I am certainly tempted to do so. But we have got to look at this rationally. A restriction on bonuses would inevitably lead to compensatory increases in basic income. That would be worse because, of course, basic salaries – unlike bonuses – cannot easily be reduced to reflect poor performance. Should we then restrict incomes in basic salaries? Well we could, but then we should logically say that perhaps we ought to limit all people’s salaries. Do we really want the EU – or even Member States for that matter – to have that kind of power?  The real problem which needs to be addressed is the high level of expense ratios of investment funds – the amount paid by investors to the funds. In the United States, equity funds charge an average of 0.64%; in Europe most funds charge over 1%. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI
). -  
Mr President, the implementation of the Compact for Jobs and Growth is to be discussed. If only words were deeds, if only wishes were achievements. The impact of tight budgetary constraint was to be monitored, but it did not act on what it saw. You cannot make a population richer by making it poorer. It promised to promote growth and competitiveness. How do the high-wage economies of Europe compete with the slave-labour wages of the so-called ‘emergent economies’? How do countries with an over-valued currency that cannot be changed unilaterally become more competitive without devaluation?  The single market is seen as a panacea for all ills, but it has facilitated the export of jobs from higher-wage economies to lower-wage economies. Improving training for the unemployed will make individuals better able to compete with their fellows. It might also marginally improve the efficiency of industry and commerce. However, it will not increase the total number of jobs immediately.  Mr Barroso believes confidence is a key to growth. It will be effective only if that confidence is soundly based. However, investors can see that the EU’s embrace of the ideology of globalism will destroy European industry and reward the emergent economies, and they will invest accordingly. Individuals might prefer to invest in their own countries, but their investment funds are, unfortunately, profit maximisers. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, paragraph 12 of the motion for a resolution says that freedom of expression – even if it offends – is at the heart of democracy. I agree absolutely. Physical attacks on peaceful demonstrators should certainly bring Turkey’s application to the EU to a complete halt. We could also mention the attempted prosecution of Mr Orhan Pamuk for a heretical view of Turkish history – but of course, France attempted to enact an almost exact mirror image or converse of that law under which Mr Pamuk was prosecuted. Many other EU countries prosecute and imprison people for heretical, historical or political opinion. The Belgian Government of Mr Verhofstadt actually banned a political party – Vlaams Blok – and Germany tried to ban a party with fabricated evidence. Turkey certainly deserves censure, but EU Member States must put their own houses in order first. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, asylum has got far less to do with shielding people from persecution, and much more to do with serving as a pretext for facilitating immigration.  The political class knows that there is opposition to mass immigration, so they present asylum as a system over which they have no control. If applicants are not detained or allowed to seek work, they will also need housing. Jobs and houses are in short supply, so they will be employed or housed at the expense of the home populations. Perhaps complicit MEPs should open their homes to these applicants and fund them from their salaries, rather than letting the poor and dispossessed bear the burden.  Of course if asylum is refused, the applicant will be given a piece of paper asking them to leave, but there will be no coercion. They can also use the legal system to frustrate removal. An Iranian asylum seeker, Mr Rostami, came to Britain in 2001 and was refused asylum in 2002. He is still in Britain after several appeals, a prison sentence and a deportation order. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI
). -  
Mr President, the solution to these problems, we are told, is more EU legislation and greater competence for the EU. Unlike the literary character Topsy, organised crime did not just grow: it has been facilitated by the EU. Schengen removed borders for organised crime just as it did for legitimate business. Drugs, arms and trafficked people can be more easily moved. A single currency makes it possible to launder the profits of crime much more easily anywhere in the zone, just as lax immigration controls and connivance with bogus asylum claims allow criminals and sometimes their wares to pass from one country and one continent to another.  Of course, not all organised crime involves crossing frontiers. The predominance of the same distinct population groups both in ostensibly legitimate cash business such as taxi firms and take-away food shops, and in drug dealing and prostitution, allows the profits of the latter to be laundered through the former. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, the substance of this proposal has every merit. People who have been subjected to domestic or other violence or harassment need to be protected wherever they happen to be – their home country, another EU Member State or, for that matter, anywhere in the world. I would be happier with a worldwide treaty to which all well-meaning countries would freely subscribe, recognising protection orders from other countries. To have EU legislation suggests that people move between countries only within the EU. I do not favour EU legislation on principle, but I do accept that it is better for vulnerable people to be partially protected in a form that I do not favour than not to be protected at all. I do not want to facilitate movement of people in the EU, but I do want them to be protected when they do move. Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that sometimes, behind this apparently well-meaning legislation, some people are more interested in the extension of EU legislative competence than they are in the substantive issue. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, the appalling problem of the millions of external and internal refugees cannot be considered in isolation. Their difficulties will only be overcome when the conflict comes to an end. The problem is, of course, that neither side seems likely to win decisively in the foreseeable future. The conflict is often depicted as being one between incontrovertible good – the opposition – and incontrovertible evil – the Government. In fact, both sides have committed hideous atrocities. The Government is politically repressive but socially secular. Some of the opposition are – or claim to be – both politically and socially liberal. Others, the Islamists, are neither, and they certainly are not secular. Their regime would be more oppressive than Assad’s Syria. The answer is not to provide arms to either side, and it is not to bring the population to neighbouring countries or to Europe. The answer is for the whole international community to urge talks between government and opposition without preconditions – except, of course, for a ceasefire. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, I congratulate Bosnia and Herzegovina on making little progress towards meeting the political criteria. The more resistance a country shows to the EU, the better, in my opinion. In particular it has resisted the move towards a neo-liberal market economy as distinct from simply a private enterprise economy. Apparently, too, little progress has been made towards freedom of movement, for which I might be inclined to congratulate them – until I discovered they are referring to freedom of movement within Bosnia and Herzegovina. If you are a Croat or a Bosniac, you might think twice about travelling through some parts of the Republic of Srpska. There is a coded reference to there being no shared vision. What this means is that the population is split three ways and political cooperation is minimal. Would it really be desirable to bring such a divided country into the EU? There is of course a lesson for us. A vertically-divided state is ungovernable, as Swedes in Stockholm must be concluding at this very moment. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI
). -  
Mr President, it is the Member States that have the responsibility to collect taxes and fight fraud, yet here the EU is trying to extend its legislative competence. It is obviously true that fraud is often committed across international borders, often by the multinationals that are so beloved by the EU’s neo-liberal policies. But ‘borders’ means all borders, and not just the borders of Member States. Action needs to be by extensive international agreement and not confined to the EU. On another subject, to talk about growth, jobs and competitiveness in the context of the EU’s energy policy is wildly optimistic. Renewable energy might well be a desirable ideal, but it is inefficient and expensive. High energy costs will not create growth, jobs and competitiveness, they will destroy them. Suppliers of energy wishing to use fossil fuels are penalised financially, and those plants will eventually be closed down. To make matters worse, emergent countries seem to be immune from strictures against the use of fossil fuels. In the UK we have vast quantities of oil locked in the ground as the result of Mrs Thatcher’s policies in the 1980s. We must discard our prejudices against fossil fuels and against nuclear energy. They will be the key to growth and jobs. The difficulty facing the eurozone will doubtless come up. Perhaps they might heed the words of Oscar Lafontaine and begin an orderly dismantling of the eurozone. Only escape from the eurozone will rescue the troubled economies of the South from permanent stagnation. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, the terms ‘pro-European’ and ‘anti-European’ are often used as shorthand for ‘pro-EU’ and ‘anti-EU’. I for one find the use of the term ‘anti-European’ to describe those of us who are opposed to EU membership, or even the existence of the EU, as highly offensive. Europe is much older and much more than the EU; it is a cultural entity, a religious entity and an entity with overlapping and related ancestries. The EU goes out of its way to welcome third-world immigration and embraces the political and economic doctrine of globalism. It is the EU that is anti-European because its policies will eventually destroy the distinctiveness of Europe. If third-world immigrants come to Europe they do not become new Europeans to replace unborn European babies, they turn parts of Europe irreversibly into the third world. It is global capitalism and the related political ideologies that fuel immigration because it regards human beings as though they were merely facts of production. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, thank you. Twenty-two years ago, Croatia fought for and eventually won its independence, for which it paid with the lives of many of its nationals. That independence has now been surrendered to the European Union. To add insult to injury, Croatia has had to pay to be allowed to surrender. Part of this price was handing over two of its generals, Generals Markac and Gotovina, to the UN War Crimes Tribunal so that they could be stigmatised – quite unjustly, as it turns out – as war criminals. Croatia is praised in the report for its democratic consolidation. Let us hope that democracy is contagious and that it spreads to the EU and its worst Member States. Croatia has been told that it must respect the rights of minorities. If some Croats have problems with minorities at present, then, in the words of Al Jolson: ‘you ain’t seen nothin’ yet’. Wait until the poor of Africa and Asia, admitted by the EU through its common immigration policy, turn up in your towns and cities and outnumber your tiny population. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, Turkey certainly abuses human rights when it prosecutes academics for expressing opinions, such as describing the 1915 killing of Armenians as genocide. Of course Turkey is not alone. France proposes an exact mirror image of that law. People will be prosecuted for saying that it was not genocide. France and many other Member States prosecute and jail people for heretical opinions, so perhaps Turkey might fit in after all. I am not an enthusiast for the European Union, but for as long as it exists, I prefer it to be more European rather than less European. Turkey is not European by its geography, ancestry, religion or culture. Whilst not being an EU enthusiast, I really find it extraordinary that a country that is still occupying nearly 40% of Cyprus should even be considered for membership. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the Prime Minister’s statement was preceded by a speech on 26 March. He spoke of the uniqueness of Europe’s regional integration being based on supposed common values. The EU talks about democracy and freedom of expression, but then it and its Member States seek to jail people for exercising that right. The values for which the EU is most enthusiastic are those of social liberalism; consensus values only amongst social liberals. He then revealed that regional integration was on the agenda all over the world. He might have said it was on the same agenda drawn up by the same people. What will this regional integration achieve? It will promote trade and remove barriers to trade not only within each region, but between regions. In that trade, Europe must be competitive, we are told. He implied strongly that labour costs would have to be curbed or even lowered. (The President cut off the speaker) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, the eurozone and the ECB are not a solution to the difficulties of the European Union; they are part of the problem. During the early years of the eurozone, northern Europe needed low interest rates to improve its growth. However, those low interest rates caused a property boom in Spain. When that boom came to an end, the banks found that they had insufficient security for their loans. In 2011, the ECB conducted two distinct and contradictory interest rate policies. The answer is that a common interest rate, like a common currency value, cannot be appropriate for 17 different economies. The report suggests that there ought to be wage increases in the north of the EU in order to stimulate aggregate demand in the south. However, would you encourage employers to increase wages above the market rate? They will certainly not be encouraged to do so when there is a plentiful supply of labour resulting from an open-door policy on immigration, nor will they do so when they have the freedom to export jobs to the Far East by relocating industry. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI
). -  
Mr President, unemployment is not falling, and is unlikely to do so in 2013. The value of the euro will not allow the countries of the south to emerge from recession. Austerity programmes will not cure unemployment. You do not make countries richer by making them poorer. Globalisation might make the emergent economies richer, but it will make European countries poorer. The single market might help low income Member States, but only at the expense of higher income Member States.  Uncontrolled immigration will make unemployment even worse. We heard earlier from a Mr Farage about immigration. Is that the same Mr Farage who said in 2010, on 4 May, that the UK ought to issue a quarter of a million work permits each year? Incidentally, the Romanian citizens he was referring to were not ordinary Romanians, they were Roma. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, Syria is, of course, anything but a democracy, but not many countries in the Middle East are, including of course its fiercest critic, Saudi Arabia. Nor for that matter are all of Mr Assad’s opponents in Syria democrats.  The Syrian government’s handling of the protest was, from the beginning, grossly disproportionate, but its brutality has sometimes been matched by the opposition. We can judge a regime also by its substantive policies. Before the conflict, women were relatively liberated in Syria. Religious minorities, particularly Christians, were free to worship without interference, although, of course, some Christians have been attacked by Islamist members of the opposition.  It is all very well to bemoan the huge humanitarian toll of the conflict, but that is what happens when neither side is capable of winning decisively. It is also what happens when the protagonists are armed, albeit covertly, by outsiders.  How long will it be before the armed forces of Member States are dragged into the conflict and body bags start to be flown home to Europe? How ethical was it, and is it, for the West to encourage other people to risk their lives to advance the West’s political agenda: that is, depriving Iran of an ally and Israel of an adversary? Was regime change really worth 70 000 lives?  The priority now must be to bring the bloodshed to an end. That can happen only when there are talks, without preconditions, on neutral territory.

 Madam President, dispute resolutions are self-evidently beneficial. Most disputes with retailers over goods and services would not be worth taking to court, which means, of course, that consumer complaints would not be considered and unscrupulous traders would take advantage of this. Of course, of the various forms of ADR, arbitration is undoubtedly the best, because at least it guarantees an early conclusion.  I have a greater problem with the underlying motive for these measures. It is not primarily to improve consumer rights, but to facilitate online cross-border trade in manufactured goods. This will undoubtedly affect adversely the manufacturing sectors of the higher wage economies of the West and the retail sectors of the West.  Nevertheless, they will benefit consumers buying products at home as well as abroad. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Violence and incitement to violence must of course be recognised as thoroughly despicable criminal acts. However, it appears that racism and xenophobia go beyond violence. Can you define these terms? I asked the Commission and the Council to do so and they were not able to. Is it not absurd to try to criminalise something that cannot be defined? Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, so Mali is going to be on the agenda. All actions have consequences, some of them unintended as well as those that are planned. Those who are disposed to learn from past mistakes will recall that Britain’s war against the appalling regime in Afghanistan, and our ill-founded war against Iraq, resulted in the London bombings by third-generation Islamists from a large fifth column in Britain. The political leaders of France, Britain and the rest will not be thanked by the families of service personnel killed in this conflict or by the families of victims of retaliatory atrocities in Europe, which will be the direct result of this perceived incursion into Muslim territory. Of course the atrocities in Europe are facilitated by a large Muslim and significant Islamist population in the cities of Western Europe. Even those like the opportunists from whom we heard yesterday, who find it expedient to oppose this latest adventure, refuse to see the presence of fifth columns in Europe as the threat they undoubtedly are. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, of course British withdrawal from the EU and the recovery of exclusive use of our waters would solve the problem, but in the mean time any attempt to improve the common fisheries policy must be welcomed. Ending the practice of discarding dead and dying fish back into the sea is self-evidently right. The practice must be ended, whether it involves under-sized fish that have been caught accidentally, or less valuable fish that are discarded to make way for more valuable fish, so-called ‘high-grading’. Of course, enforcement with regard to the latter practice might be rather difficult.  Enabling Member States to enact their own conservation measures within a 12-nautical-mile zone is clearly desirable, but the Member State must be able to enforce that against other Member States. The rapporteur’s proposal that fishing concessions should cease to be freely transferable is particularly good. It would stop concessions from being bought and sold, and the concessions would remain the property of each Member State.  Successful policymaking is dependent on accurate supporting information. It has been estimated that stocks of 70% of the species caught in the EU have not been assessed accurately. The report particularly does not fully address the problem of incompatibility between the conservation of fish stocks and the survival of fishing industries. The only solution is for countries that have provided the bulk of the fish stock to be given priority in their own waters. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the year begins with unjustified optimism about growth prospects, but that recedes as the year’s realities begin to emerge. If you persuade countries to share a currency that is over-valued for some of them, if you import manufactured goods from countries of low wages and inhuman conditions and tolerate the transfer of production and investment to emergent economies, you will not get growth, you will get recession. If you import cheap labour from poorer countries, you will not get increased employment of our own nationals, you will increase unemployment. We have unsatisfied needs in our economies and unemployed people who could satisfy them.

 Mr President, whilst I am not an enthusiast for the European Union, if we must have it, I prefer it to be more European rather than less European. These negotiations between the EU and Mercosur – and many other trading associations – show that the EU is not exclusively, or even mainly, focused on Europe. It is globalist. It has the ambitions that all cosmopolitans and neo-liberals have, of a borderless, undifferentiated world in which goods, services and people will move without let or hindrance.  The result of this is not only that eventually all distinctive peoples and therefore cultures will disappear, but that all wage rates and standards of living will approximate to the same level – which would not be the level that modern Europeans enjoy. The theory of international trade is that the world as a whole will be richer as the result of comparative advantage. However, it is not necessarily true that each country or continent, or each social group and sector, will also be richer. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, we have heard a lot about the priorities of the Irish Presidency, including improving economic growth and creating jobs. Of course neither is very likely at all with the euro being grossly overvalued for many of the southern European countries and the EU’s disastrous embrace of globalisation, neo-liberal economics and austerity measures.   Of course these and other priorities were not initiated by Ireland any more than Cyprus’s priorities were devised by that country. The Irish Foreign Minister let the cat out of the bag on 12 January: he said, “Today’s meeting helped to build on 18 months of Presidency preparations in close contact with the Commission”. It is all an elaborate delusion in which the rotating presidency provides a sort of demographic or democratic legitimacy to the programme of the unelected Commission. The President of the Council presides over a meeting of Member State representantives with an agenda provided for it from outside. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, I found the Cypriot President’s New Year’s Eve message refreshingly honest, as far as it went. He admitted that the policies implemented on a pan-European level had not succeeded in providing a solution to the crisis. He could, of course, have gone further and said that, if southern European countries in the eurozone were to revert to their own currencies, each being left to find its own value, those countries would enjoy export-led recoveries. He could have said that EU countries – individually or collectively – should protect their industries from imports from the so-called emergent economies. Earlier in December 2012, he did explain that the impasse on the Cyprus problem had been caused by Turkey, which used the Cyprus Presidency as an excuse. He might have added that the EU, for all its talk of solidarity, appears not to regard the Turkish occupation of Northern Cyprus and the desecration of its Christian places of worship as an impediment to talks on Turkey becoming a member.

Mr President, this report makes many valuable proposals about how companies ought to respond to restructuring. It is self-evidently right that workers should receive the maximum notice of redundancies and of course receive improved opportunities for re-employment. However, recital AC states, quite rightly, that different companies, sectors and countries have different needs, so I think Member State legislation would be more appropriate than EU legislation. There is one glaring flaw in the report. It treats the need for restructuring as though it were an autonomous need over which neither the EU nor Member States had any control. Recommendation 1 mentions the need for companies to be competitive. The question is with whom or what and why? The answer is twofold: relatively low labour costs within the EU and peripheral countries in Europe and much lower labour costs and appalling working conditions in the Third World and the so-called emergent economies. The unspoken cause of the need for restructuring is the process of globalisation which all the countries have signed up to. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, Mr Donskis is quite rightly concerned about selective justice under the guise of the rule of law, but of course only in new and transitional democracies.  In a number of EU Member States it is possible to be jailed for stating one’s views on immigration or expressing an opinion on academic subjects. Honest tyrannies that admit expressly to jailing people for being opponents are rare indeed. Nearly all tyrannies inside and outside the EU pretend that they are adhering to the rule of law but in fact they have passed laws which are tailor-made for their political opponents. France is probably the worst culprit in the EU, where the incautious choice of a word, detail or debate might lead to prosecution, as might the posing of an unfavoured analogy or comparison between events. Ms Le Pen is the latest victim of such a prosecution. Such countries are not so much democracies as gulags or prison camps. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, I am in principle opposed to all EU legislation but, other things being equal, I prefer that legislation to be in the form of a directive rather than the form of a regulation, which of course is self-enacting. The content of the 1996 Groundhandling Directive was bad enough because it resulted in an increase in short-term contracts and greater use of new staff. This has led to a fall in wage levels. The proposed regulation would bring about further liberalisation. This might look good from an accountant’s perspective, but the jobs involved include aircraft maintenance, cargo handling and dealing with passengers, encompassing security checks.  Is it really desirable to jeopardise safety, security and handling of valuables to transient staff without continuity of service? Liberalisation in this sphere, as in every other, is a recipe for oppressive working conditions, wage cuts and a lower standard of service. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, the report talks of the liberalisation of trade, investment and public tendering leading to mutual benefit. Trade liberalisation is, of course, a euphemism for globalisation, which actually leads to mutual detriment. The European Union will export its industrial technology to Central America, or possibly even relocate its manufacturing there, employing cheaper labour working in inferior conditions.  Cheap, duty-free goods will flow into the EU, jeopardising profits, wages and jobs in Member States. These are already in deep recession, with rising government debt. The report boasts of the expansion of the quantity and range of goods that will be tariff-free. The commitment to public tendering will allow multinationals based in the EU to swallow up public procurement contracts in Central America. This agreement, like globalisation – of which it is a part – is not for the benefit of ordinary people there or here, but in the interests of multinational corporations. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, we are used to hearing supporters of the EU project saying that we need more economic union, not less – not a sentiment I agree with. But I would say that the European Union is not European enough, and has become wedded to the political and economic ideology of globalism. The report refers with approval to the EU document of 2006 entitled ‘Global Europe’. This agreement, like many similar ones, removes virtually all tariff and non-tariff barriers after a transitional period. The EU is moving slowly but surely towards a world free of tariffs, a situation in which all living standards in the world will gravitate to the same level. The EU is sailing under a false flag. It is not a European Union, but a global union. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, human trafficking does not need to involve the crossing of national frontiers or even travel within a country. According to the UN it includes ‘recruiting people by deception for exploitation for prostitution’ – what we in Britain call ‘grooming’. British police and politicians were for years frightened to act for fear of being called racists. When my colleagues on Bradford Metropolitan Council in 2006 proposed a motion urging action against grooming, all the other councillors and parties voted against it. Those councillors included the present Conservative MP for Keighley, who is belatedly trying to exploit the issue. Whilst nationalists came to the rescue of British adolescents, all of the other parties walked by on the other side. When my former colleague, an MEP for the North-West, tried to draw public attention to the issue, the police and CPS tried unsuccessfully to prosecute him for incitement.

– Mr President, the real problem is all manufactured imports from, and all relocations to, China and other emerging economies. Indeed, the problem lies with ourselves, or rather with yourselves – addicted to neo-liberalism and the economic and political ideology of globalism. I will let you into a secret. China might have transformed itself into a capitalist economy and country but it is not neo-liberal. It competes with us with artificially depressed wage levels, which not only reduce costs, but also prevent the development of a market for imports from the West. Flagrant patent violations, 19th century working conditions, cheap state loans and subsidies and a grossly under-valued currency. In the meanwhile, they are stock-piling resources and Western currencies. If you think that global companies originating in the West are on our side, remember they are eagerly relocating where the costs are lowest and the conditions worst. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

– Mr President, there are several distinct questions apart from the obvious one of asking whether the EU should exist to spend any money at all. Is it spending money on the right things and the right recipients? Should it be the EU, as distinct from Member States, that spends that money? There are some items on which I would be happy for no money to be spent at all: the Year of the Citizen or the resettlement of economic migrants posing as asylum seekers. There are other targets of expenditure which are perfectly proper, such as the support for industry or agriculture, but in these cases the function ought to be exercised by Member States. How much should each country pay and how much should each receive? The EU does not advertise itself as an instrument for the redistribution of income and wealth as an end in itself, although it does precisely that, in the name of social cohesion. Fellow nationals of a Member State have a sufficiently shared identity to regard the pooling of resources and support as perfectly justifiable. However, the pooling of resources and support further afield is often a stimulus for resentment and even aggression – not exactly what the EU would like to produce, which is social cohesion. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

– Mr President, (inaudible)
 … austerity programmes do anything but aggravate a country’s problems of unemployment and debt. However, if people in various Member States are suffering because of those programmes, it seems a contradiction that a supranational body of which their country is a member should be asking for an increase in spending. It seems a contradiction, that is, if the country is a net contributor. Perhaps net recipients are less worried by that contradiction. Britain has always been a net contributor, which is why a previous prime minister negotiated the British rebate. Those who are now seeking to reduce our rebate by recalculating it want us to be even more of a net contributor. The UK might achieve a freeze on spending but still increase its net contribution. The British rebate is not money paid into a begging bowl held by a richer-than-average – and therefore undeserving – country; it represents the return of part of an excess of contributions over receipts.

 Mr President, ‘economic and monetary union is not an end in itself’, says the report. Quite right: it is an instrument to achieve political union. The report claims that it will achieve sustainable growth and a high level of employment, but it admits that unemployment in the 27 has risen by 50% from 2008 to 2012. In those countries for which the euro is overvalued, mass unemployment and negative growth are directly attributable to euro area membership. If they were to leave the zone they would experience export-led growth and a fall in their unemployment. The euro-led recession in the South has not left the North unscathed. Its exports to the South have been reduced severely. More control and austerity measures will not reduce debt. They will reduce employment and profits, which will cut government revenue. This will lead to more debt rather than less debt. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 – Mr President, this is an unusual example of the EU recognising a real problem which does need to be addressed internationally, though not necessarily by the EU. The problem with passing a law which prohibits people from purchasing something is that, the longer the process takes, the greater the chance of the purchasers – in this case would-be terrorists – stockpiling the items in advance of the ban. I can remember this proposal first being mentioned in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs at least a year ago, possibly longer than that, and of course we do not know when the legislation is likely to be passed and come into effect. I think it would have been preferable, initially, to agree internationally to enlist the support of the industry in adopting a voluntary code of practice, and then to encourage all countries, including Member States, to pass legislation without delay. In the UK, for example, it is possible in certain circumstances to pass a law within 24 hours. The procedure in the European Parliament is so long and detailed that it is likely that would-be offenders will already have stockpiled before the legislation is enforced. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, the report is not so much a piece of economic reasoning as a tautology. More integration is seen as necessary to achieve more integration. Coordination is not an answer to unemployment but is seen as an end in itself; it is not so much a cure for unemployment as displacement activity for those without a cure. The answer to the problems of the South is not austerity, which produces only more unemployment. It does not even do what is written on the tin, which is reducing debt. Most of the countries of Europe need reflation without inflation. We must remember that what is physically possible must be financially possible, or there is something wrong with the financial system. We need to see an abandonment of the euro experiment and southern countries released to enjoy export-led booms. We must reject globalism, protect and recreate our industries and reject the coded references in this report to wage cuts and worsened economic conditions. We must not drive down our wages and conditions... (The President cut off the speaker) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI
).  
– Madam President, the Commission’s priorities are directed towards greater integration as an end in itself and not towards measures that will solve the real economic problems facing the populations of Europe. The greatest of course is the recession, with its unemployment and under-employment, squeezed incomes and reduced benefits. Indeed, the austerity programme is calculated to produce unemployment and not to combat it. One policy area mentioned is genuine economic and monetary union: the euro, with its common external value that is hideously overvalued for the countries of the South, and which is aggravating and perpetuating the recession for them. Another Commission priority is said to be to use EU resources to improve competitiveness. Well, countries with overvalued currencies cannot compete even with other countries in their region. The EU’s embrace of globalism means that European manufacturers have to compete with emergent economies with pirated designs, workers on artificially depressed wages and slave-labour conditions.

 Madam President, yet again we vote on a report full of insane sabre-rattling against undemocratic Russia but, as the nominations deadline for the EU elections approached for Italy yesterday, the police force of your occupation government arrested dozens of Forza Nuova activists, imprisoning them without any justification ...

 Mr President, the plight of minorities and refugees in Syria is indeed terrible, but who have they fled from? I went to Syria twice last summer and wrote the letter that the Syrian Government sent to help sway the UK Parliament’s vote against a bombing campaign that would have killed and displaced even more innocent victims. While I was there, I met Christian, Alawite and Muslim refugees. I can tell you that huge numbers of them have been forced from their homes by the same Jihadi rebel terrorists that the EU has done so much to help. If you really care about the people of Syria, you should insist that the CIA and Zionist warmongers stop arming their Jihadi mercenaries and you should impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia and Qatar for funding the invasion of Syria by the thousands of Islamist cut-throats from whom so many Shia, Christians, Alawites and moderate Sunnis have had to flee for their lives. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, we all agree that the Communist regime in North Korea is an undemocratic shame. What are we to make of a regime that jails its opponents on trumped-up charges and keeps them in prison, even when the political motivation for it is tape-recorded and exposed? What are we to make of a regime that claims to hold free and fair elections, but then arrests its opponents to stop them collecting and delivering the 300[nbsp ]000 signatures they need to stand? If it happened in North Korea you would rightly condemn it, but the victims in my first example are Greeks, and in my second, Italians. Because the systematic police repression of Forza Nuova activists has happened there in the last 24 hours. So stop whining about North Korea, as it is totally hypocritical unless you also stand for the right of European electors to choose Golden Dawn or Forza Nuova if they so wish. You have no power at all to change North Korea, vile though the Communist regime there undoubtedly is, but you could order your backyard occupation puppet regimes to restore democracy in Greece and Italy this afternoon.

 Mr President, what is the main aspect of EU foreign policy? To help the USA meddle around the world in places that have nothing to do with us – Iraq, Serbia, Libya, Afghanistan, Syria. You have acted as cheerleaders for aggressive neo-con interference which has benefited only radical Islamists but has destroyed societies, while costing British taxpayers billions of pounds. Now the target is Russia.  Members know full well that the so-called Ukrainian revolution was manufactured with everything from the agitprop to the snipers provided from the USA and the EU. We all know the root of the tough Russian reaction is aggressive NATO expansionism, first into Poland, next into Ukraine. Yet you persist in irresponsible sabre-rattling in someone else’s natural sphere of influence. It is said that in 1914, Europe sleepwalked into war. This time you are heading there with eyes wide open. The basic choice is war or peace. You seem hell-bent on war, so remember: whatever excuses you manufacture, plotting an aggressive war is itself a crime. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr[nbsp ]President, when the godfather of the European Union, Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, published the plan for a united Europe and the ethnocide of the peoples of Europe, the encouragement of mass non-white immigration was central to the plot. Since then, an unholy alliance of leftists, capitalists and Zionist supremacists has schemed to promote immigration and miscegenation with the deliberate aim of breeding us out of existence in our homelands. As indigenous resistance to this human genetic-modification industry grows, the criminal elite seeks new ways to camouflage their project. First, their immigrant pawns were temporary guest workers; then it was a multiracial experiment; then they were refugees, and then the answer to a shrinking population. Different excuses, different lies – and asylum is just another one. But the real aim stays the same: the biggest genocide in human history, the final solution to the Christian European problem. This crime demands a new set of Nuremberg trials, and you people will be in the dock. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nick Griffin  (NI

I have a constructive suggestion to help those poor asylum seekers from Africa. Yes, make it clear they cannot come here so they do not try to cross the sea and drown in huge numbers. The best way for them is to get the banks off the backs of their countries so that they can live in peace in their countries and we Europeans can live in peace in ours. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Madam President, unlike the others in this debate I have gone twice to war-torn Syria to see at first hand what is really going on there. So I can tell you that the majority of the refugees do not want or need to come to Europe. They just want the West to leave the Syrian army to finish off the Islamist terror gangs from whom the Christians, Alawites and moderate Sunnis fled for their lives. Then they will be able to go home.  The Wahhabi minority should go to their Gulf State sponsors, where they too would be at home. I can also tell you that, having used the CIA to help the rebels destroy so much of Syria, American and French corporations are already in contact with Damascus to negotiate multi-billion-dollar reconstruction contracts. While the EU and Mr Farage unite to import a wave of violently Islamist asylum seekers to already poor and stressed parts of our constituencies, American and French companies are chasing profits for big business, as usual.

Madam President, Prime Minister, 2014 is supposed to be the year of democracy in Europe, but what kind of democracy tears up its own constitution, bans demonstrations to prove the people are happy, sends machine gun-toting storm-troopers to arrest democratically elected MPs and imprisons opponents without trial when they cannot disprove hearsay allegations made against them by police informers? Totalitarians like you always justify such attacks on freedom with propaganda lies about criminal association but, Mr Samaras, your bankers’ occupation government – now busy helping your masters loot Greece – are the real criminals. You are the heir of the communists who refused to fight when your country was invaded by Mussolini, when Metaxas said ‘no’ and fought foreign occupation and exploitation – which is of course the real crime of its modern political descendants, Golden Dawn. Nick Griffin  (NI

Mr President, there is all this fuss over the activities of an unelected pressure group which was warned in advance not to invade the waters of a sovereign nation and break legitimate laws. No Russian citizen has ever voted for Greenpeace. They have no democratic mandate whatsoever. So imagine how much bigger the fuss would be if Russia launched a totally illegal assault on a legitimately-elected political party. Imagine if the Russian Government were to use the excuse of waves of lies from a controlled mass media to arrest the leaders of the opposition. Imagine if President Putin were to tear up the constitutional rights of democratically-elected parliamentarians and spit in the face of a growing body of opinion of up to 20 % of voters. We would never hear the end of it, and rightly so. But when these things happen in Greece, you hypocrites either say nothing or actively applaud the repression. No one ever voted for Greenpeace, but half a million Greek voters have been disenfranchised by the attempted murder of Golden Dawn at the behest of EU bureaucrats, German bankers and Zionist gangsters. This looters’ coup against the Greek people by the puppets of the privatisation criminals is a thousand times more important than this artificial hysteria on behalf of an unelected, unrepresentative group of watermelon-green cranks.

 You do not like the truth, do you? You really should stop lecturing Russia about a speck of dust in her eye when you have a large, splintered beam in your own. Nick Griffin  (NI

Mr President, having spoken in Damascus with many relatives of victims of the Islamist war on Syria, I hope that we all welcome the Russian proposal to put chemical weapons beyond use, without an escalation of the conflict. We should do everything possible to help this diplomacy to succeed, because if it falters Obama, Hollande, Cameron and the other neo-con puppets will drag us into a conflict that is certain to spiral out of control. Obama claims there will be no boots on the ground. That is a lie, because if the US bombs Syria into the clutches of al-Qa’ida, then Syria’s chemical weapon stockpile will end up in the hands not of the United Nations decommissioning teams, but of the heirs of Osama bin Laden. American, British and European troops will then have to be sent in to try and secure those weapons, and our soldiers will die in Syria in order to stop children dying in Islamist poison gas attacks, not just in Damascus but in Paris, London and New York. That is why we should turn the Russian peace proposal into reality. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, I recently spent four days in Damascus, a city that is striking for its normality and religious tolerance. Contrary to the propaganda about repression, Sunni mosques are open and some women wear clothing which shows the Salafist sympathies of their husbands. Others wear mini-skirts. It is a secular society much like ours. I also met captured free-Syria army rebels not only from North Africa and Central Asia, but also from France and Spain. They spoke freely about their aim, once they were done in Syria, to bring their bloody jihad to Europe – to London, Paris, Madrid, Stockholm and Manchester. At least 600 EU-born Islamists are fighting with the rebels. If you send arms to Syria, they will go to men who will bring them back here and turn them against us. If you arm the rebels, you will not just help these cut-throats destroy the last tolerant secular state in the Middle East, you will also bring Wahabi terror to our streets. Stop and think before you plunge your hands in so much innocent blood. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, tonight several hundred more British old-age pensioners will freeze to death. Why? Because of fuel poverty. Because carbon profiteers, wind farm wide-boys and left-wing broadcast media like the BBC have conned and bullied and bribed MPs and MEPs into believing – or pretending to believe – that man-made global warming is going to destroy the world. This modern version of an ancient religious fantasy is being used as an excuse for the biggest corporate scam in human history. Carbon taxes make fortunes for the super rich while old Mrs Smith shivers to death. Tonight, while out-of-touch politicians waffle on about unattainable targets that will de-industrialise Europe, real people are dying one by one. There is a legal term for what the political elite are doing here: corporate manslaughter. Nick Griffin  (NI

Madam President, when we discuss violence against women, there is a desperate attempt to avoid mentioning the giant green elephant in our midst: Islam. Islam’s inherent devaluing of women and hostility to unbelievers combine to make it the greatest threat to millions of women and girls in many parts of the EU. In Britain, the crime of on-street grooming for sex, drugs and prostitution is directed against thousands of girls as young as 10. Many of the victims are beaten, threatened and gang-raped. While the majority community produces many perpetrators of internet paedophilia and one-on-one sex crimes, paedophile gang rape is a crime in which the perpetrators are overwhelmingly Muslim, while their innocent victims are invariably from other communities.  In my constituency, 14-year-old Charlene Downes was groomed, raped and murdered. Her body has never been found. The case against two Muslim men collapsed on a technicality; however, while the police say that they are not looking for anyone else, they continue to ignore evidence of jury rigging and refuse to seek a retrial. Charlene’s mother and grandmother are bravely and actively campaigning for justice. Shockingly, this has resulted in both of them being repeatedly threatened with arrest for involvement in entirely peaceful protests. The problem of officialdom turning a blind eye to the inconvenient truth about Islam and sexual violence is thus endemic. I urge those here who are concerned about this issue to face the politically-incorrect truth, because denial will not make the problem go away. Justice for Charlene Downs!

 Madam President, while the people on that side of the House are denying the facts, thousands more young girls will suffer as a direct consequence of your denial. Of course Islam is directly involved. When you have a religion which says that a woman’s rights in court are half those of a man, when you have a religion which says that a woman who is raped can be stoned to death for adultery unless she can produce four male witnesses to prove she is innocent, then of course that creates a mentality within that community which is fundamentally anti-women.  It started with Muhammad, who raped a captive – a Jewish captive – whose husband he just had murdered. He started that, and he is regarded by Muslims as the perfect man. His example colours what Muslims do. Many Muslims do not, but within their community this is real problem. You need to recognise that fact and address it, not run away from it. Nick Griffin  (NI

You say your heart beats strongly for women raped in India – mine does, too – but does your heart not also beat for the thousands of young girls gang-raped in Britain over the last few years, or are you simply left in ignorance because the facts are concealed by the controlled liberal media?

 Mr President, this is a depressing but predictable report: the persecution of hundreds of thousands of Christians, one and a half million refugees, broken infrastructure, murderous sectarian militias, daily bombings and shootings, child prostitution, honour killings, female genital mutilation and brutal Islamist repression of women. It is good to see the EU, albeit indirectly, admit that Western meddling in Iraq has led to disaster. It would be even better if the cheerleaders for the illegal war of 2003 that created this shambles were to apologise and learn from their terrible error. It is utterly hypocritical for members of the globalist elite to shed crocodile tears over the collapse of Iraq while at the same time striving to replicate it in Syria. Just as in Iraq, so the fall of Assad would lead not to Syria becoming a replica Switzerland, but to its collapse into bloody anarchy and the triumph of Wahhabi fundamentalism. This meddling has already helped kill hundreds of thousands in Iraq. It is time for a little humility and to leave Syria to the Syrians. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, I was an international observer in the Ukraine elections. I had unrestricted access in Kiev to polling stations, election officials and party activists.  I have seen corrupt elections where gangs of thugs sponsored by the prime minister attack opposition activists; where council workers are threatened with losing their jobs if they vote the wrong way on ballot papers that carry traceable serial marks; where two million voters do not even exist but still vote by post; where, at the close of polls, unsealed ballot boxes are taken to central counting places by unsupervised officials; where the election officials are appointed by the local ruling party. But all these assaults on democracy go on routinely in the United Kingdom. In Ukraine I saw a robust and well-designed system, ensuring elections which, while not perfect, are much freer and fairer than those in Britain. EU hypocrites do not have any right to criticise Ukrainian elections. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Madam President, the fracking debate is full of deceit by those who stand to profit from shale gas or who see it as a weapon in neocon hostility to Russia. We are told that most fracking in the USA is by small and medium-sized enterprises, yet few real SMEs have the capital or technology for fracking. What looked like SMEs are in fact limited liability fronts for giant corporations. They exist solely to spare the parent companies the huge cost of eventual clean-up operations, which will therefore fall on the taxpayers. The game is simple: loot, pollute and scoot. Claims of massive job creation are lies too. The Public Policy Institute of New York State claimed that 500 new wells per year would produce 62 000 jobs, yet a review by Food and Water Watch showed that the true figure is fewer than 7 000, scarcely one tenth of the promised boom. In every part of the USA where shale gas is exploited, house prices crash by 25%, with environmental devastation from hundreds of platforms and huge, poisoned slurry ponds. The longer-term threat to water supplies could be even more costly. Gas fracking is short-termist, boom-and-bust exploitation. Yes, it produces energy, but so would burning all our forests. It makes no sense except to lobbyists and politicians in the pay of the companies doing the looting. The answer to the energy crunch is not short-term fracking but long-term, safe, sustainable nuclear power and electricity- and hydrogen-fuelled transport systems. That is the energy economy of the future. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Madam President, the voluntary system proposed would have very little effect on Britain because the British system is already very effective. But I have heard from a number of constituents who are concerned that anything involved in the transportation of live animals can, in the end, be used to facilitate the transport of animals for slaughter over a long distance. This is something that is clearly unnecessary in an era of modern refrigeration, and which needs to be phased out. On the question of labelling, the great concern of everyone concerned with animal welfare is that all meat originating from animals suffering ritual slaughter should be labelled: consumers have the right to know and to reject it.

– Mr President, in May, President Barroso bragged of the EU and its Member States throwing EUR 1.2 billion a year down the Afghan drain. But EUR 1.2 billion is only a fraction of the true cost. Britain’s contribution alone to the Afghan farce, according to the British Ministry of Defence, is already over GBP 18 billion, plus GBP 3 billion in aid, plus GBP 4 billion in equipment that is to be left behind, plus GBP 5 billion that will be screwed out of the British taxpayer to run Afghanistan for a further 30 years. Most importantly, 417 British dead are the highest price of all and the most obscene, because it is a war that has nothing to do with Britain. We should bring our troops home at once and put the neo-con crooks who sent them there on trial as war criminals. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, no decent human being can feel anything other than deep sympathy for young men who leave their families and risk death in overcrowded boats in order to reach a new land of milk and honey. But why do they do it? Who is responsible for luring these poor people into so much disappointment and even danger? The politicians. Because every time the political class insists on giving one batch of immigrants the houses, taxes and jobs that belong to the long-suffering natives in Manchester or Malmö or Brussels or Birmingham, you incite another boatload to risk their lives to get to the promised land and be given other peoples’ milk and honey. Three simple rules would end the immigration crisis. One: no jobs for immigrants while our own people face mass unemployment. Two: if a greedy boss is caught employing illegal labour, the business should be confiscated. Three: if you have not paid in, you do not get a house or a penny in benefits. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, it would be easy to mock this report. Indeed, it is being laughed at by millions of British voters reading their papers this morning. Coming at a time when the euro disaster is breaking nations and driving desperate people to suicide, this staggering exercise in politically correct sloganising could – had it been on the agenda at the start of this month – easily have been mistaken for an April Fool’s joke. But in truth, this attempt to institutionalise discrimination and contempt against half the population of Europe is not a laughing matter. Men and women are conceived to complement each other for the common good. This proposal is an attempt to sow discord between the sexes, break family values and export EU Frankfurt School poison worldwide, using the excuse of climate change. Such incitement to gender-based contempt, division and hate is not a victimless crime. Hundreds of thousands of men are denied access to their children after bitter divorces. Thousands of children are snatched by the state because the crucial importance of fathers and loving, united families is denied and undermined by militant feminism of the sort that underlies this report. Meanwhile, there are real problems out there hurting real people. Voters expect us at least to try to solve them, not to waste our time and their money on sexist anti-male, anti-family gibberish. Ladies and gentlemen, please, let us drop this empty, bigoted sloganising and work together to deal with real problems. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, be careful what you wish for because you may get it. This old saying is very true about reducing our use of hydrocarbons. By 2050 we will have a low-carbon economy for the simple reason that we will largely have run out of carbon. All the increases in non-conventional hydrocarbons, including from environmentally catastrophic shale oil and gas fracking, are only just about keeping up with the worldwide decline of conventional oil production. The long emergency of peak oil has begun. Those who think we can deal with it by building wind farms and eating nut cutlets may mean well, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. The biggest threat is to food production. In agriculture, before the age of oil, for every calorie of energy invested by man, horse or ox, the average return was one-and-a-half calories. On that small surplus our ancestors built their cathedrals, painted their Rembrandts and wrote their Rights of Man. Oil-based agriculture uses far fewer people to produce far more food. Its ratio is twenty-to-one. That is an input of 20 calories of oil energy for machinery, fertilisers and pesticides for every calorie of food produced. Today’s globalised world is a house of cards, built on the suicidally-unsustainable use of finite fossilised sunlight. This is the real carbon crisis which we need to address. If we continue to fail to do so, today’s children will look back in despair at all the time and energy that our generation wasted trying to kill the wrong pig. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, as an observer in Moscow at the Duma elections, I witnessed a robust system which is far more democratic than the fraud-ridden shambles in Britain. If observers come to elections in London this May, they will find hundreds of thousands of non-existent ghosts voting by post without any kind of ID check. They will see flimsy cardboard ballot boxes with voting papers falling out of gaps at the bottom, mainly under the control of appointees of Baroness Ashton’s Labour Party. At least the Russians have elections. Baroness Ashton became one of the most powerful figures in post-democratic Europe without a single vote. And who elected the technocrats now asset-stripping occupied Greece and Italy? We all know the real reasons for the attacks on Putin. George Soros and his banker friends want to privatise and loot Russia just like they are looting the West. So forget about the specks of dust in Mr Putin’s eye and remove the giant planks of electoral fraud and elite greed from the European Union’s. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, I can start by saying that Mr Bové’s report is so comprehensive that it is difficult to add anything to the excellent job he has done. But I will point out that, with agricultural wages in Morocco at an average of just five euros a day, trade liberalisation can only add to the desperate plight of farmers in Greece, Sicily and Spain. It is madness for the EU to give preferential treatment to big business concerns exploiting the Maghreb while its banking elite force murderous poverty on hard-working people in our own back yard. Since not even the most crazed global-warmist still claims that we will soon be growing olives in Lancashire or oranges in Kent, it follows that we will have to continue to import such produce. Let us do so from our hard-pressed fellow Europeans in Greece, Italy, France, Portugal and Spain. Leave the farmland of Morocco to support farming families in Morocco, rather than helping international agri-business swallow it all up and spit the human wreckage out at our shores as destitute and angry Islamist refugees.

 Mr President, on weapons of mass destruction, one should remember how politicians and media liars queued up to demand action against Iraq over WMDs. That propaganda lie justified sanctions and an illegal war. MEPs who voted for sanctions against Iraq over those non-existent WMDs might have meant well, but they helped to murder hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children, who died through lack of food and medicine. Now it is nuclear weapons of mass destruction. It is a new target, Iran, but the main victims will be the same – children – because a successful oil and banking embargo would make it impossible for Iran to buy enough food and medicine for its population. If the EU votes for sanctions it exposes itself as bankrupt – not merely financially, but morally too. If Saudi Wahabis and Zionist neo-Cons want war with Iran, that is their business, but it is not ours, and we should stay out of it.

 Mr President, I am no friend of Iran. I am very critical of Islam and all things Islamic, and the Islamic threat to Europe. But, as regards the Middle East, that is the affair of the countries of the Middle East. It is not for us to interfere. When the Iranians look at what happened to Libya – which did not have effective weapons – you really cannot blame them for wanting to defend themselves, if that is what they are doing. As for weapons of mass destruction, however, we have heard the lies before and I think we are hearing the lies again. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, in discussing Durban, the most obvious question is whether an agreement last year to reach an agreement in three years’ time to do something in eight years’ time is really an agreement at all. Likewise, one has to ask whether the agreement to create a green climate fund and transfer USD 1 billion a year from hard-pressed taxpayers in countries like Britain to corrupt third world oligarchies reflects a serious threat of global communism or a happily unattainable fantasy. Given the way in which EU Commissioners are forcing economically suicidal spending cuts on the protectorates of Greece and Italy – a move likely to spark a chain-reaction implosion of the entire financial system – the fantasy answer is fortunately the more realistic. But the most significant thing about Durban is what was not discussed: climate science. This is no surprise, as it is now crystal clear that the so-called scientific consensus on man-made global warming simply does not exist. It is not just a matter of the thousands of independent scientists who dispute the whole theory: even the warmists themselves now admit that the computer models on which the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) cult is based are simplistic and flawed. The more they learn about feedback mechanisms and the complexity of real climate, the more they realise they do not know. To crucify our taxpayers and de-industrialise our economies in pursuit of the one-world government madness of the United Nations is therefore crazy. Hence the failure of 10 000 well-meaning tax-eaters to agree anything serious in Durban is to be warmly applauded. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, when there is a stench of death and decay in your house, there is no point complaining about the neighbour’s drains or arguing about which air freshener to try next. The first thing to do is to admit that the real problem is the rotting corpse of the dead elephant in the living room. It is absurd to speak of economic governance while ignoring the root cause of the debt crisis that is dragging Europe, and indeed the world, down to economic disaster. The thing that is rotten is the fiat money banking system. A system that allows the banks to create credit out of nothing and lend it into circulation as interest-bearing debt; a system that makes bankers the masters of the universe, instead of the servants of productive industry. A system that leads to poverty, division and war. The first step to long-term economic stability is to put an end to the international bankers’ swindle and restore the power to create credit to sovereign national governments. This is the only way out of the crisis; the way to prosperity and peace. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Madam President, my constituency is suffering a hidden epidemic of sexual grooming so I appreciate the efforts of all those involved in producing this report. The grassroots campaigners for the protection of children tell me that the report misses the most important target. To concentrate on online pornography while relegating real-life child sexual abuse to a page 33 annex is to worry about a speck in one eye while ignoring a splintered plank in another. Real-life abuse is described in the report as ‘offline grooming’. Such terminology is an insult to the victims and their families. It is not offline: it is on our streets. It is not a matter of images: it is a matter of real-life degradation, gang rape, and even murder. But because a disproportionately large number of street groomers are Muslims, politically-correct censorship prevents the issue from being properly discussed. Because of this deliberate downplaying of the problem, on-street grooming is not even a specific offence in many countries. As a result, the crime remains statistically virtually invisible. This undermines attempts to secure justice for the victims, effective responses from the authorities, and proper penalties for the perpetrators. In my own constituency, the family of Charlene Downs still waits for justice following the botched prosecution of those arrested over the grooming, rape and murder of their little girl in 2003. Despite their belief that 60 other girls had been groomed by the same gang, and that Charlene’s body was disposed of in kebabs, the police regarded their report as too sensitive to publish. The consequences of such cowardice became clear four years later when 15-year-old Paige Chivers went missing, believed murdered, at the hands of the same gang. Of course, not all police officers are politically correct cowards, any more than all Muslims are groomers. The vast majority are as sickened by these things as we are, but the playing down of the problem in reports like this aids the criminal minority and leaves new victims at risk. The more serious crimes should get the attention. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, for some years now climate realists like me have struggled to understand what lies behind the man-made global warming hoax which will be further exploited at Rio+20. Various theories have been put forward. Post-1989, it gave the far left a new stick with which to beat the West. Maurice Strong and the United Nations saw it as a way of promoting one-world government. It has handed carbon traders and wind factory profiteers a taxpayer-funded blank cheque. But none of the above explains the hitherto puzzling role of big oil and neo-con foundations in funding the environmentalist protest groups which have led the climate-change and anti-nuclear propaganda offensives. Now, however, their real agenda is coming to light. Phoney green hysteria has blocked the potential for nuclear and coal electricity to power our civilisation in the post-peak oil world. This gap allows those who will profit from gas fracking to say that we have no choice but to exploit this environmentally disastrous energy source. Of course we have no choice, because their useful idiot Greens have denied us the other alternatives. So now we face a fracking gold rush in, among other targets, Lancashire, Wales, southern England, France and Poland, where George Soros has just won an almost exclusive licence to loot and pollute almost the entire country. The neo-cons and globalists are also excited about the potential of fracked gas to advance their geopolitical agenda of reducing the influence of Russia and destabilising the Arab world. Climate change never was about drowning polar bears. It was always about big business profit and elite power. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, EUR 1 billion every year: that is the amount of taxpayers’ money that the Commission and Member States give to the Palestinian Authority. EUR 1 billion a year to a corrupt regime that does very little for its own people, while ordinary voters in our countries are crushed by rising taxes and inflation. It is unreal. Worse than that, EU policy is based on the false concept that a two-state solution is workable. It might have been once, but it is too late now. The Palestinians are geographically dispersed: over two million live east of the 1947 armistice lines, a million in Gaza, and about a million in Israel. In the Occupied Territories, the illegal Zionist settlement programme has sliced their land into disjointed parcels. Even if all the territories conquered in 1967 were included, Palestine would still be only 22% of the territory of the current Greater Israel. It would be an economic basket case, forever reliant on foreign aid handouts. The two-state solution sounds pretty, but it is simply not realistic. Yet again, the EU is throwing money away on a policy doomed to failure. We must accept that we cannot solve every problem in the world. We should turn our attention and money to solving our own. Let us face it: thanks to the euro disaster, this place is not going to run out of problems. EU meddling in the Holy Land is not only stealing money from overtaxed British families; combined with even more massive US aid for Israel it encourages both sides to refuse to get serious about sorting out their own differences. None of it helps real people. It is a counterproductive waste of EUR 1 billion a year. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, my voters and my party are overwhelmingly sceptical about GM crops. Like the majority of voters in every country of Europe, we reject technology imposed for the profit of giant multinationals without safeguards or consent. We reject technology that will replace sustainable local family farming with short-sighted international agri-business. Where we part company with the Commission is over the way in which the Europhiles, as always, are seeking to exploit such genuine concerns and real problems by pushing for federal European solutions. This report, giving back a little power to nation-states, is a welcome exception. But, in the long term, if the people of Britain want to secure the freedom to reject Frankenstein foods, they will not get it by bowing to the European project. They will only get it when they reject the rule of the corrupt Westminster political elite and their big business puppet masters, because it is that out-of-touch greedy elite which is forcing upon us both Frankenstein foods and the Frankenstein monster that is the European Union. Our voters demand the freedom to reject both in free and fair referendums. The Westminster elite is not only allowing reckless multinationals to genetically modify our food, their mass immigration policy is also genetically modifying the entire British population, just as your utopian multiculturalism is destroying traditional identities all over Europe. This is why, both in Westminster and Strasbourg, we the people have to get rid of the elites before the elites get rid of us. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, first it was cucumbers, yesterday it was bean sprouts. Today, it is not bean sprouts. The truth is that the experts just do not know, but each time such allegations are made, they destroy livelihoods in countries’ economies. What we do know is that there is something very strange about this outbreak. There is an unnatural combination of strains and DNA in the virus. It is affecting unusual groups of people in a way not normally associated with E coli outbreaks. It has already struck far more people and in far more places than a normal outbreak and, unlike in normal outbreaks, it has not been rapidly traced to one or two food suppliers. Given all these inexplicable factors and the fact that various countries – including Britain, the USA, Iraq and Israel – have, in the past, been reported as experimenting with genetically manipulated E coli as a biological weapon, should there not be an urgent inquiry into the possibility that this outbreak is, in fact, an instance of, and perhaps a test run for, biological terrorism?

 I voted to oppose the removal of the Parliamentary immunity of Bruno Gollnisch because: 1. Free speech is a core value of our society and the cornerstone of our democracy. It should not be curtailed by political opponents. The comments attributed to Mr Gollnisch were not incitements to violence and were not abusive or insulting. The comments were about the intolerance of Islamist regimes towards Unbelievers. 2. No debate was allowed before the votes on this issue, which affect the fundamental rights of an MEP. 3. The proposal to lift Bruno Gollnisch’s immunity (and the politically motivated decision to lift it) were inconsistent with the proposal to allow the German MEP Elmar Brok to retain his immunity from prosecution for an (alleged) greed offence of tax evasion. It is clear that the prosecution is a vexatious one, by a private organisation, designed to deprive Mr Gollnisch of his elected position and his good name. It is equally clear that, in the increasingly intolerant atmosphere of Political Correctness that is permeating the Parliament, some MEPs are more equal than others. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, the explosion at Chernobyl was a disaster, but let us keep it in perspective: 64 people were killed by Chernobyl radiation over 23 years, and it caused an unknown proportion of 6000 cases of thyroid cancer. These are tragic figures but they pale into insignificance compared to the death toll on our roads. Yet, while no one is using road traffic accidents to campaign to ban the motor car, a small army of leftists is using Chernobyl to push for an end to nuclear power. I do not doubt that they mean well but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. The same people meant well when they helped to create the biofuels rush, pushing the price of food beyond the reach of the world’s poor. Tonight millions of children will go to bed slowly dying of hunger because people on that side of the House meant well: that is what the fuzzy ideals of the Utopian left do in the real world. The impact of a nuclear ban would be even worse because the alternative to nuclear power is not wind farms and solar panels. In our energy-scarce, post-peak oil world, the alternative to reactors is mass starvation. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, as is so common here, this debate has little connection to reality and none whatsoever to democracy. Most here talk as though Iceland being sucked into the Euro black hole is a done deal. But that is not the message coming from Icelanders. Current opinion polls show that those who wish to keep their independence outnumber the Euro-Quislings and Europhiles nearly two to one. Seventy-five percent of Icelanders wisely do not trust the EU. The only Icelandic party in favour of membership has slumped from 30% to 18% in the polls. It is the same all over Europe. While the political elite move to ever closer union and federal empire, the people want freedom and independence. Such mismatches are the seedbed of revolution. Congratulate yourselves on accession progress all you like, but the coming financial meltdown in the countries being crushed in your Euro straightjacket will be costly to us all, but fatal to your Utopia. Iceland, and the nations now stuck in your raspberry Reich, will be free at last. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, as I hear discussions on ways to screw more money out of the little people in the name of climate change, I am struck by two things. The first is how no one talks about global warming anymore. Even the most out-of-touch MEPs have clearly realised that exposés of fraudulent pseudoscience and record cold winters across the globe have made the public, rightly, very sceptical about all the deceitful propaganda about drowning polar bears. The second is the car park beneath us – Porches, Mercedes, BMWs, SUVs, a showroom of gas-guzzling luxury from the people who tut-tut in disapproval at many white vans and plot to make working lives even harder with speed limiters and financial penalties, all for a dogma based on discredited statistics pedalled by a clique of bought and paid-for academics, funded and hyped by super-rich vested interests in the green industrial complex – Al Gore, Prince Charles, Shell and Goldman Sachs – all of whom stand to steal a fortune from the taxes harvested through wind factory subsidies and carbon trading. While I appreciate the efforts of some MEPs to blunt the worst excesses of this CO2
 hysteria, the plain truth is that anyone who even gives credence to the threadbare hoax of man-made global warming is a collaborator with the deadliest scam in history. Yes, deadly, because it is not only robbing ordinary people and de-industrialising the West; it is also right now starving to death hundreds of thousands of the world’s poorest children as food crops are replaced by taxpayer-subsidised biofuels. But it is boosting profits for Monsanto and giving MEPs all expenses paid trips to palm oil plantations in Malaysia, so that is all right is it not? No, it is not, particularly as it is diverting attention from the real crisis – not that we are releasing carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, but that we are beginning to run low on the oil which powers our civilisation. Every day wasted talking about limiting emissions of nature’s most important fertiliser is a day lost in the struggle to sustain more and more people on less and less energy. If it was not such a tragedy, it would be a farce. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, I do not know if the House noticed, but yesterday was also the record snowfall in Korea for 100 years, so it is not just a few places. Just as it was two years ago in Copenhagen, when the climate change conference was there, it was the coldest at the climate change conference in Cancún that it had been for decades. Secondly, there is no evidence whatsoever of meltwater from the Arctic impeding the Gulf Stream. There has been no change in that whatsoever. Thirdly, your arguments would be more effective if the climate change computer models had foreseen this a couple of years ago. They did not. A couple of years ago, we were told that our children would not know what snow was. What an absolute nonsense this has been. Finally, as for the statistics showing a global warming trend, the key factor everyone is ignoring here is that 65% of the world’s weather stations are within 10 metres of an artificial heat source. They are virtually all in cities. The collapse of the Soviet Union meant that most of the weather stations in naturally cold areas were closed down. That is what has skewed the statistics, which are fundamentally bogus because people, boosted by the United Nations, set about finding man-made global warming in order to impose the solutions they wanted.

 Madam President, a young woman in my constituency has this morning, as every weekday morning at this time, just returned home from walking her two young children to school. Jenny used to drive them there but she can no longer afford to put petrol in the car for anything other than her twice-weekly trip to the cheapest supermarket in her part of Manchester. This morning, as every morning, Jenny is hungry because she has a choice for breakfast: either she eats or her two little girls eat. There is not enough bread and jam for all of them. Meanwhile, here on planet EU, MEPs discuss tweaks to a financial instrument that involves the spending of EUR 1.1 billion of taxpayers’ money on promoting democracy and human rights, mainly in the third world. Most of those tweaks further reduce the oversight the nation states have, as the Commission burns its way through vast amounts of British taxpayers’ money. What a waste and what hypocrisy to bang on about women’s rights in Africa when thousands of Jennies cannot even feed their kids properly. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Madam President, this report demolishes the lies of the British political class about the Afghan War. I do not know the names of any of the innocent Afghan victims of this wicked war, but I do know that it has nothing to do with British interests. And I know the names of the 18 brave young men from my constituency who paid with their lives for this madness in the last year alone. Corporal Simon Hornby, Liverpool; Warrant Officer David Markland, Lancashire; Kingsman Sean Dawson, Stalybridge; Corporal Harvey Holmes, Hyde; Corporal Terry Webster, Chester; Lance Corporal Andrew Breeze, Manchester; Marine Steven Birdsall, Warrington; Marine Paul Warren, Preston; Sergeant Steven Darbyshire, Wigan; Private Alex Isaac, Wirral; Private Douglas Halliday, Wallasey; Colour Sergeant Martyn Horton, Runcorn; Private Thomas Sephton, Warrington; Sergeant David Monkhouse, Cumbria; Sapper Darren Foster, Carlisle; Lance Corporal Jordan Bancroft, Burnley; Kingsman Darren Deady, Bolton; Guardsman Christopher Davies, St Helens. What a criminal waste of brave young lives! It is, of course, no business of the European Union what wars Britain should or should not fight. That is for the British people and our elected representatives in our House of Parliament in Westminster to decide, just as it will be for us to decide one happy day to put Messrs Blair, Brown and Cameron on trial for war crimes, because Afghanistan, just like Iraq, is a criminal war.

– Mr President, as carbon crooks and One World Government conspirators celebrate their advances at Cancún, UK Prime Minister Dave Cameron declared his satisfaction with the outcome. At the end of the coldest first half of December in central England since records began in 1772, Dave is satisfied that the Green Climate Fund will cost British taxpayers GBP 2.9 billion on top of the GBP 18.3 billion a year that the Climate Change Act siphons from British consumers for the corporate crooks in the green industrial complex. Coincidently, GBP 2.9 billion is also the amount the Treasury will save by increasing the debts of British students, condemning them to a lifetime of bondage to the banks. That scam has already caused student riots. Taxpayer riots over far bigger scams – bail-outs to corrupt and incompetent banks, propping up the zombie euro and the global warming hoax – are yet to come, but come they will and, unlike Prince Charles and Camilla, their targets will deserve everything they get. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, I should like to say to the Commissioner that the new energy strategy report ignores the elephant in the living room: peak oil. But at least the Commission has at last woken up to this gigantic and immediate threat. The moment one recognises peak oil, the majority of this largely well-meaning report becomes, sadly, incinerator fuel. The huge energy gap opening up cannot possibly be filled by Mickey Mouse renewables or shale carbons. Coal, nuclear fusion – and in the long term nuclear fusion plus fission – are the only energy sources dense enough to save us as the oil age comes to an end. Commissioner, now that this has been recognised, can we look forward to a new, serious approach to energy? We must ditch all the nonsense about wind-power grids and global warming and concentrate on real scientific solutions to the peak oil crisis. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, choosing sunny Mexico for COP 16 was a good move. We should be spared a repeat of last year’s embarrassment, when global warmists shivered in the coldest Copenhagen December for decades. Likewise, using the deceitfully ambiguous term ‘climate change’ rather than ‘global warming’ may blind a few British taxpayers to the irony of holding it just as an unusually cold summer gives way to an early, icy winter. An even better trick would be to hold these events only in the spring: look, it is getting warmer every day. How much longer can the fascistic EU impose ever more punitive taxes and controls on ordinary citizens on the pretext of man-made global warming, when an ever-increasing number of real scientists are rejecting the theory as unfounded and demolished? AGW is baseless propaganda, a Josef Goebbels-scale big lie from the green industrial complex because they favour massive transfers of wealth from the little people to carbon-trading crooks, such as Al Gore and Goldman Sachs. And it is being exploited by leftist political elites to complete the deindustrialisation of the west because spineless conservatives are too browbeaten by global warming hysteria to stand up and tell the really inconvenient truth: man-made climate change is the most profitable con trick in history. This year’s Bilderberg conference, held in Spain in June, included a session on the dangers of global cooling. When will the new realism of the people who really shape global politics creep in here, among the people who merely think they do? Andrew Henry William Brons and Nick Griffin  (NI

– We abstained on the Bilbao Barandica, Gallagher and Ferreira reports on the grounds that they contained beneficial and harmful proposals in the same instrument. However, we voted in favour of the Gróbarczyk report, despite having misgivings about some of its content (e.g. its suggestion that the discard system might have worked well for certain species of fish – we are opposed to the discard system completely). We voted in favour of it because it promised a review of the discard system. This is about as much as we can hope for within the confines of the common fisheries policy. Nick Griffin  (NI
).  
– Mr President, it is good that the EU is trying to preserve endangered fish stocks, but before there is too much self-congratulation on these proposals, we must remember that many past EU fishing rules have been appalling failures. Britain’s home waters have been fished to near extinction under European fisheries policies. The reality is that the protection of fish stocks is best left to local fishermen and national government marine scientists, not EU bureaucrats. The advice from the men working in the broken remnants of Britain’s fishing fleets is simple: scrap quota systems, which lead to discards and high grading, and replace them with weight-based catch limits so that all fish caught are landed for human consumption or for processing into animal and fish feed. We need to replace the system of openly tradeable quotas and so stop financiers, supermarkets and the super rich from speculating in fishermen’s livelihoods. Quotas of all kinds – and in whichever seas – should be owned by fishermen from ports with traditional connections to those waters and be tradeable only between fishermen who are likewise entitled to fish by personal, family and community connections. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, before taking advice from any expert it is wise to examine their record to check that they are competent. The Integrated Maritime Policy report is partly the work of the Committee on Fisheries, so before buying into its grand schemes it is worthwhile taking a critical look at the European Union’s record on the management of the seas. Inevitably, this means assessing the situation in the former sovereign UK waters, secretly betrayed to European bureaucracy control in 1973, since nearly 70% of so-called ‘EU fishing stocks’ are actually British fishing stocks. How have our fish and our fishermen fared under the common fisheries policy (CFP)? The figures tell us far more than all the fine words in this report. 88% of the EU’s stocks are overfished, against a global average of about 27%. 30% of our fish species are now officially outside safe biological limits, because there are too few adult fish left for normal reproduction. Under the CFP’s obscene quota system, nearly a million tonnes of fish are discarded dead into the North Sea alone every year. Meanwhile, the industrial hoovering-up of species such as sand eels has led to crashing populations of bird species such as puffins. To Europe’s south, the picture is just as bad. West African fishermen, whose lifestyle had been sustained for generations, are being forced to switch to people trafficking because EU-registered vessels have helped fish their waters to extinction. It is time for the EU to acknowledge that its record in maritime management is the worst in the entire world, a typical example of what is known as the tragedy of the commons – the phenomenon by which shared resources always get exploited ruthlessly, because anyone who exercises restraint is disadvantaged by the unscrupulous. It is time to restore control of the seas and fishing grounds to the sovereign nations, whose track record has shown them fit to exercise such stewardship. In the case of the two-thirds of EU waters that the EU has fished to extinction, that means the British nation and British fishermen. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, as is so often the case with EU proposals, these financial instruments include measures which have great emotional appeal. All decent people like us want to stop drug smuggling, people trafficking and the supply of small arms to conflict zones, but it is very easy to be emotional and generous with other people’s money. Thus, while ordinary people in Greece, France, Ireland and Great Britain are having their societies ripped apart by cuts and their backs broken by taxes, the Scholz report will add EUR 176 million to the EUR 172 million already committed to help third-world capitalists gobble up even more of our jobs. The Goerens report will blow EUR 190 million, including EUR 17.4 million for a facility for rapid response to soaring food prices in developing countries. It may have escaped your attention, but food prices are soaring in our constituencies as well. Worst of all, however, is the Brantner report. Here, on page nine, it speaks of a financial envelope of EUR 2 062 billion by 2013. This is, of course, a misprint. I hope to God it is a misprint, but the fact that such a ridiculous error could slip past all the experts and MEPs who have read this report speaks volumes for the careless abandon with which the European Union spends money. This money does not grow on trees. It is not handed out by a giant tooth fairy. It is not the Commission’s money; it is not MEPs’ money. It is taxpayers’ money and a hugely disproportionate amount of it is British taxpayers’ money. Nick Griffin  (NI

The real question is why BP is drilling for oil through 5 000 metres of rock, in water 1 500 metres deep, in the middle of a hurricane zone. The answer is peak oil – the point at which we have used the half of the world’s reserves that were easy, safe and cheap to produce, and now rely on shrinking reserves which are increasingly inaccessible, dangerous and expensive, both financially and environmentally. Deepwater is merely a symptom of peak oil. Using it as an excuse for yet another EU power grab will not stop us reaching peak or suffering its potentially catastrophic consequences. Instead of talking about symptoms, it is time to get serious about the disease: the fact that we have used all the easy oil and are still addicted to the stuff. In recent months, this reality has begun to dawn on – among others – President Obama, the British Government and the German military. It is time for the EU to take its head out of the sand, stop obsessing about climate change, and study and address the real crisis: peak oil. Nick Griffin  (NI

Mr President, the prospect of being jailed for thought crimes is shocking. Unlike most of the people here, I can tell you that from personal experience. The British Government has tried to jail me three times under anti-free-speech laws that state that telling the truth is no defence. So I am very sympathetic to Chinese, and especially Tibetan, dissidents forced into slave labour in Communist prison camps. Steps must be taken to prevent the goods they make being allowed to undercut manufacturing and workers in the West. But, if one accepts that items made by forced labour constitute unfair competition, it is impossible to avoid the same conclusion about goods made by sweated labour, by workers who are not allowed to organise into trade unions in a country where there are no environmental protection costs. The truth is that all manufactured goods from China constitute unfair competition. Trade with China, far from being free, costs millions of jobs and destroys our manufacturing base. It is time to protect our workers from this unholy alliance of Communist tyranny and capitalist greed. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, lawyers chase ambulances: where there is an accident, there is a parasite rushing in to profit from someone’s misfortune. The advocates of European Union are ambulance-chasers extraordinaire: from the fantasy of man-made global warming, to earthquakes and forest fires, every crisis becomes an excuse to grab even more power. The Russia-Ukraine gas crisis was an artificial problem caused by neo-con interference in the politics of Eastern Europe. The answer is to stop ‘baiting the bear’ and to leave the nations of Europe free to buy the gas that Russia needs to sell us. Instead, the crisis is used as an excuse for the EU to seize control of gas supplies and ensnare us all in a web of interdependence designed to enforce the Union that voters would never approve. This is not about gas supplies. It is the creeping tyranny of a Socialist superstate using deceit to grab what it cannot get democratically. When it drops the mask of reasonable necessity, its new fascism will be imposed, not with castor oil, but with deadly cold. That is why freedom lovers will vote against this report. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Madam President, the defining feature of the EU conspiracy, apart from endemic waste and fraud, is that it rides roughshod over the wishes of real people. The push to bully Iceland into surrendering to EU rule is an example. Gallup polls reveal that 60% of Icelanders want to retain their freedom by staying out of the EU. Only 26% are now fooled by the pro-Union propaganda of the corporate media. This is no surprise. Icelanders have the oldest tradition of true democracy in the world. They do not want to exchange it for rule by unelected commissars. Icelanders have some of the last great fish stocks in the world. They want to preserve them from being destroyed, as EU membership has destroyed Britain’s fish stocks. Icelanders are proud of their Viking origins, vibrant culture and identity. EU rule would doom Reykjavik to becoming a scale model of the Muslim ghettos of ‘Londonistan’, Paris, Brussels and Copenhagen! So, from the belly of the Euro beast, I urge the people of Iceland: stay free! Say ‘no’ to European Union! Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, the EU’s strategy for jobs sounds good, but the reality behind the scenes is very different. To take just one shocking example, the forthcoming trade agreement between the EU and India will have a devastating impact on Indian agriculture and pharmaceuticals. Indians are rightly worried by this threat to their prosperity and independence. But with the Indians giving up so much, we need to ask what is in it for Indian big business and what is it going to cost workers in Britain and Europe. The answer is Mode 4 immigration, which bypasses any national caps on immigration. Transnational corporations will gain the automatic right to bring in Indian labour to replace, for example, skilled British workers in steel and car plants and all the other industries now owned by Indian-based TNCs. The India-EU trade agreement will devastate the wages and employment prospects of hundreds of thousands of British and European workers. This is not a strategy for jobs but a naked sell-out to corporate greed. Nick Griffin  (NI

– A permanent shortage of organs for transplantation hampers the wonderful efforts of health care professionals to help patients. It is also a sad fact that there is a shortage of donors, and that this drives some vile criminal activities. To seek to address these problems by creating an EU-wide database is, however, a mistake. It is naive to place hopes in a database covering the whole of the EU, with all its different languages and IT systems, when the failed attempt to produce a Health Service database for the UK alone has wasted billions of pounds. Health services across Europe are unable even to fund basics, and face savage cuts as ordinary citizens pay for the bust of globalism. This being so, far more can be done to encourage organ donations by investing in education programmes at national levels, than by diverting funds to pay for well-intentioned bureaucratic meddling. Additionally, there are tight time constraints on organ viability. Thus, an EU-wide network would be of use to very few patients. Proposals to set one up are another pretty-sounding excuse for the further advance of an agenda that has nothing to do with patients’ welfare and everything to do with federalist dogma.

– Mr President, the most important priority of any budget should be only to spend your own money. Spending someone else’s without their permission is not budgeting, it is theft. British taxpayers are fleeced to the tune of GBP 6.4 billion in direct payments to the EU annually and we are still denied our referendum. Taking that money, without a democratic mandate, is not a victimless crime. Fifty thousand of our pensioners died of cold this winter because they could not afford to heat their own homes. Our soldiers are killed by Taliban bombs because we cannot afford blast-proof vehicles. Thousands of cancer victims are denied expensive life-saving drugs. GBP 6.4 billion would right all those wrongs and still leave change to build eight new hospitals and 50 schools. There should be only one budget priority – slash spending and stop robbing Britain. Our pensioners, soldiers and cancer victims need the money more than the EU. To you, it is a budget. To them, it is a matter of life or death. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Madam President, there is an English folk tale about King Canute who, by ordering the tide not to come in and wet his feet, showed his courtiers that not even kings are exempt from reality. In doing so, he became a byword for arrogant folly. King Canute lives on in the Council of the European Union, which begins and ends its conclusion on Arctic affairs with the alleged importance of global warming. This involves a refusal to accept scientific reality. According to the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre, Arctic summer ice has increased by 409 000 square miles, or 26%, since 2007. This is exactly what was predicted by scientists aware that the previous shrinkage of summer ice, wrongly used as evidence for global warming, was in fact nothing more than a snapshot of an ages-old natural cyclical pulse of advance, retreat and advance. So the Arctic summer ice will not vanish by 2013 and polar bears have not, and will not, drown because of global warming. But millions of hard-working voters are drowning in a sea of debt and taxes, and they are growing very impatient with the political class’s use of the global warming fraud to impose undemocratic international governance and bogus green taxes. The UN has now announced a review of the IPCC’s dodgy dossiers and fiddled statistics. On behalf of the taxpayers of Britain, I ask this Parliament to do the same and to stop wasting any more money on the most expensive big lie in human history. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, discussing tax cooperation during the current euro crisis is rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic
. The southern nations are known in English by the harsh acronym PIGS (Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain). However, those being crucified on the euro are not pigs but people, scourged by utopian one-size-fits-all dogma. Their economies will either die of a thousand cuts or be bailed out, to the ruin of taxpayers in Britain and elsewhere. There will be very little tax to cooperate over. There are two ways out: either abolish the euro and return to the captive nations of this Strawberry Soviet their own currencies, or expel the ‘problem countries’ from the euro. That might be the PIGS. More justly, it would be Germany and her French collaborator, because running the euro according to German interests is the root of this shambles. This endless crisis will destroy the federal project – tax cooperation and all. The tragedy is that it will grind so many innocent victims into poverty before it does so. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, after Copenhagen, let us reassess the whole global warming story. At Copenhagen, we had the irony of not just ‘Climategate II’, but also the onset of one of the harshest winters in decades. Since then, we have seen the debunking of the Potsdam sea-level scare; the Goddard Institute has been caught fiddling the temperature records; the vanishing Himalayan glaciers have been exposed as a fantasy; Mr Pachauri has emerged as a climate change profiteer. The world is cooling. Global warming is a fraud. This is not a victimless crime. Carbon taxes push up fuel prices, killing our old folk as we speak. The billions wasted researching this non-existent problem are billions that cannot be spent defeating real scourges such as Alzheimer’s, or ending real environmental disasters such as deforestation. Carbon credit trading makes billions for City sharks at the expense of families in poverty. The loss of agricultural land to biofuels has already doubled world food prices, so millions are starving while greedy corporations make even fatter profits. Those pushing the unscientific nonsense of man-made climate change – Shell, Monsanto, the international banks, Bilderberg one-worlders, carbon billionaires and their useful idiot allies on the left – are running the biggest fraud in human history. They must and will be called to account, as should their collaborators in places such as this. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, the horror of Haiti is shocking. It is only human to feel compassion for the innocent victims of the natural disaster there. All of us here are well paid and can afford to give. I will give my attendance allowance for today if every British MEP will do the same. However, with their taxes, our constituents cannot afford your generosity. Globalism has destroyed our industries. The banks have ruined our economies. EU red tape is strangling our entrepreneurs and the carbon-tax scam is plunging millions into deadly fuel poverty. The death toll in Haiti is shocking, but this winter, more than 50 000 pensioners in Britain alone will die premature deaths because of the cold and the cost of heating. Across Europe, the death toll will run into hundreds of thousands, but, because this truth shames the political elite and because it highlights the inconvenient truth of global cooling, this scandal will be buried as quietly as are our elderly dead. Hundreds of thousands of our own people are dying because of government neglect and EU cold taxes, yet you insist on throwing other people’s money at a disaster in somebody else’s back yard. That is not compassion: that is stinking hypocrisy. I know this place is uneasy with our Christian heritage, but as always, our Bible reveals an eternal truth that most here would rather ignore – first book of Timothy, 5:8: ‘but if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.’ Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, two months ago, my constituency was hit by disastrous floods. Deceitfully blamed on climate change, the real reason for the devastation of the town of Cockermouth was the EU-imposed privatisation/theft of public services. The proper management of reservoirs has been replaced by cost-cutting negligence by United Utilities, leading to safety margins being ignored and a panic-stricken decision to open sluice gates and release a man-made deluge on the town. The fact that only one brave man died in the floods was little short of miraculous, but such disasters will increase in frequency as more and more public services are looted by greedy corporations. Finally, my constituents are shocked that they will not receive a penny from the EU Solidarity Fund, because the UK cannot apply unless the damage exceeds EUR 3 billion. Since Britain is not in an earthquake zone, it is almost impossible to conceive of a disaster which would trigger such a payment, so British taxpayers – who contribute a disproportionate amount to the funds – have no realistic chance of benefiting from it. So much for solidarity. We want our money back! Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, everyone agrees that climate change is the biggest challenge facing humanity: that is the constant claim of the political elite, and it is a lie. Everyone does not agree. Thousands of scientists dispute the very existence of man-made global warming, citing natural cyclical changes that saw vineyards in Roman northern England and a Swedish army march over the frozen Baltic to Copenhagen in 1658. As an army of global-warming zealots marches to Copenhagen, the truth is that their Orwellian consensus is based not on scientific agreement, but on bullying, censorship and fraudulent statistics. In the words of leading climatologist Professor Lindzen, ‘Future generations will wonder in bemused amazement that the early 21st century’s developed world went into hysterical panic over a globally averaged temperature increase of a few tenths of a degree and, on the basis of gross exaggerations of highly uncertain computer projections [...], contemplated a rollback of the industrial age’. In fact, there will be no bemused amazement, for the reason for this hysteria is clear. It is designed to provide the excuse for a political project of the globalists to replace national democracy with new world order global governance. It has nothing to do with science and everything to do with the globalist common purpose to tax and control us, while making billions for corporations in the green industrial complex. The anti-Western intellectual cranks of the Left suffered a collective breakdown when Communism collapsed. Climate change is their new theology, a secular religious hysteria complete with Pope – Al Gore – carbon-credit indulgences and the persecution of heretics. But the heretics will have a voice in Copenhagen and the truth will out. Climate change is being used to impose an anti-human utopia as deadly as anything conceived by Stalin or Mao.

– Madam President, there is endless rhetoric here about friendship and cooperation between every state under the sun except for Russia. China commits genocide in Tibet. Turkey denies its Armenian holocaust. The USA flattens Iraq and this place fawns on them. But for Russia, there are only pompous and hypocritical lectures. This confrontational Russia phobia shamefully feeds the new Cold War drive of America’s warmongering neo-con lobby. Of course, there are some local differences between Russia and her neighbours, but can we not agree that next week’s summit should be used to attempt to build bridges and cooperation between the eastern and western halves of our civilisation? For historical and cultural reasons, this is far more practical and safer than attempting to create unity with Turkey, Europe’s ancient and eternal enemy. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Madam President, in the last two months, I have suffered victimisation by the UK Labour regime, including withdrawal of my House of Commons pass, refusal to allow me to enter the Sellafield nuclear processing plant – despite my position on a subcommittee of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – and the refusal of the Citizens’ Advice Bureau to sell me an information database openly advertised for sale to all other MEPs. Madam President, would you agree that political discrimination is not only unlawful but is also an attack not just on me, but also on the functionality of this place and, most important of all, on the voters and the entire democratic process? Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, there are two overriding themes in this place: first, concern with the growing gulf between the political elite and the ordinary taxpayers. Second, a hysterical obsession with man-made global warming. These two themes are intimately linked. The global-warming fixation is a classic example of how the political class here is out of touch with the little people who have to pay the bills. While the EU backs the Copenhagen proposals to further the deindustrialisation of the West and the corporate domination of the Third World, a growing majority of ordinary people regard climate change as an elite scam – an excuse to tax and control us and to impose internationalist dogma and global government at the expense of the nation state. Can you not see the danger in this growing gulf? It is time to look at the facts. Man-made global warming is an unproven theory based on manipulative statistics. The so-called consensus on the issue is the product not of debate but of the suppression of expert dissent. Before the political class and the green industrial complex dare to impose a single new tax, poisoned light bulb or useless wind farm on the ordinary taxpayer, they need to try to convince the public that global warming is
 man-made, that returning to the warmer climate of medieval times would be a bad thing and that there is something that Europe – as opposed to the United States, China and India – can actually do about it. Either hold a debate and close the gap between you and the people, or do not complain when we nationalists – the ones who listen to the people – close it for you. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, last year I served as a monitor at commemorations for the 1956 revolution in Budapest. I can confirm that Dr Morvai is right to criticise those who fret about Iran while ignoring human rights abuses here in Europe. I trust that no ECR Group members here will be hypocritical enough to condemn Iran for the use of violence in elections when David Cameron is among the sponsors of Unite Against Fascism, an organisation of far-left criminals which routinely deploys intimidation and violence against nationalist dissidents in Britain. The same is true of five current Labour, Lib Dem and Tory MEPs, marked with the shame of supporting the use of British taxpayers’ money to support their own militia, which breaks up opposition meetings and attacks their opponents with bricks, darts and claw hammers. But my main point is this: however well meaning, and even justified, criticisms of Iran made here may be, they will be exploited as war propaganda by the powerful vested interests that stand to gain from a military attack on that country. Neocons, oil companies, construction corporations and the Wahabi mullahs of Saudi Arabia all want to see the sovereign state of Iran destroyed by an aggressive war. Not even European liberals are naive enough to fall for lies about weapons of mass destruction again, so human rights are being drafted in as a new casus belli
. Do not add the voice of this place to the warmongers’ chorus for a third illegal and counterproductive attack by the West on the Muslim world. Or, if you must, do not leave the war – which hypocritical rhetoric will help to justify and unleash – to the usual brave British cannon fodder: 18-year-old boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne. Instead, send your own sons to come home in boxes or without their legs, their arms and their sanity – or mind your own business.Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, there is a principle in English civil law called ‘to one who is willing, no harm is done’. In other words, you cannot sue if you put yourself in danger of loss or injury. These illegal immigrants were not kidnapped in their own countries by wicked Europeans who then brought them to Europe and incarcerated them for eighteen months or more. They chose to enter an EU country illegally and then avoided being repatriated. Presumably they are free to return to their countries of origin, but refuse to do so. We have heard that illegal immigrants – those who do not leave – are usually given a piece of paper ordering them to leave, in order to avoid them disappearing. If their stay is a long one it is usually because of extensive court actions to avoid repatriation. While talking about a breach of the Returns Directive, we learned in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on 31 March that in 2012 only 37% of those given a return decision eventually left. The other 63% remained. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, we are hearing the 1914 language of self-righteous indignation to imply that one side is completely in the right and the others completely in the wrong. We might not like Mr Yanukovych – and there is much about him I do not like, if it is true – but his removal as President did not fall within the categories in Article 108 of the Constitution of Ukraine, and the procedure for impeachment in Article 111 was not followed. The civil disturbances in Ukraine were orchestrated from the EU when Yanukovych rejected the EU trade agreement. This was just as much interference in Ukraine, and with less justification, than anything that Russia has done. The taped conversation of Victoria Nuland and Geoffrey Pyatt about who should lead Ukraine was evidence of blatant US interference. It is all very well to call a referendum held by the Crimean Autonomous Republic illegal, but this was no more illegal than the removal of Mr[nbsp ]Yanukovych. Crimea had traditionally been part of Russia since the 18th Century, until 1954 when it was handed over by Mr Khrushchev, a Soviet leader of Ukrainian descent. The recent referendum was hurried and insufficiently debated, but the result was hardly ambiguous. Large powers, like Russia and the United States, have what they see as legitimate spheres of interest. The United States was not going to allow Soviet missiles in Cuba in 1962. Russia was not prepared to accept with equanimity a member of the EU and NATO within its traditional borders.

 Mr President, ‘own resources’ is a rather misleading euphemism. The EU has only the resources of its Member States, so their populations pay taxes perhaps more directly to the EU instead of through the treasuries of Member States. One of the purposes might be to disguise which countries are net contributors and which are net recipients, thus obviating the necessity for rebates and correction mechanisms and replacing them by a series of lump-sum payments over the next six years. You also remove from potentially rebellious Member States the power to threaten to withhold contributions from the EU. There is also a symbolic – or perhaps a psychological – significance of people paying taxes directly to the EU. It sends a subliminal message to taxpayers that the EU has the status of a state. How will own resources be enforced? By using officials and judges employed by Member States? Or perhaps new EU tax officials and courts will emerge, as though from nowhere.

 Mr President, the 2012 report of RAPEX reported that there had been a 26% increase in the number of alerts for dangerous products. This was not just the result of greater market surveillance, as the rapporteur said; the number of dangerous products really was increasing. Do we know the countries from which these products come? There have been some coded hints this morning, but only coded ones. On 20[nbsp ]January, we learnt from a debate on a proposed regulation for consumer protection that 58% of notifications for dangerous products related to goods from China, and that in a further 16% of cases it was not possible to identify the country of origin. Importation of cheap goods from emergent economies does not only undermine our manufacturing basis (and of course the jobs of our workers), it also has the potential for injuring our consumers. Freedom of movement of goods – not just within the EU, but globally – is the root cause of dangerous products in our markets. The EU is not so much a European Union, as it is becoming a global union.

 Madam President, EU legislation, unlike trade, does not extend beyond its borders, so it might not answer all the animal health needs of animals originating in third countries. This regulation would replace complex existing legislation and much of its substantive content would certainly be beneficial. Healthy farm animals are recognised as a prerequisite of human health. Whilst the rapporteur acknowledges that this is not primarily an animal protection law, she quotes with approval the description in a parallel regulation that animals are sentient beings and has written that the legislation protecting live animals when travelling should be amended to reflect distances travelled rather than just borders crossed. Sentient beings can feel pain and suffer from discomfort and fear. Ritualistic slaughter of animals without pre-stunning is self-evidently cruel treatment of a sentient being. Food from such an animal will not of course be a hazard to human health, but it will be a wound to civilised sensibilities. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, the nature-nurture debate used to be the most important in politics and was the key to a whole range of political views. The nurture side had much to be said for it – perceived kindness and fairness and, of course, non-discrimination. The nature side had only evidence to support it.  However, nurture now seems to have been declared the winner without a contest. Indeed, nature has been airbrushed out of the picture, even as a contestant. All public policies, whether devised by left, right, centrist or a populist safety valve, base their policies on a false assumption. They assume equal potential ability, which does no favours to those without it. They assume third world migrants can be substitute Europeans, when they only turn Europe into the third world. They confuse social mobility with equality of opportunity and do not realise that the latter will eventually bring the former to a shuddering halt. They throw money at continents that cannot benefit from it, because Europe takes their brightest and best. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, the External Action Service seeks to develop a common policy and only then persuade or cajole Member States to adhere to it. I am in favour of joint action, but only when it is necessary. This must be based on prior agreement on objectives and a genuine commonality of interests, not a shared desire for aggressive adventurism.  Paragraph[nbsp ]25 states that there is a strong link between development and conflict prevention. European States should therefore stop fomenting conflict in other countries that can cause devastating recession and dire poverty. Of course, the greatest reason for stagnation in the poorest of countries is a dearth of talent. This is made worse by northern countries looting what talent they have, generation after generation. We must reverse the brain drain and encourage their brightest and best to reinvest their abilities in the countries of their birth or descent. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, I am not an admirer of the Iranian Islamic Republic, but there are many repressive countries in the world and some of them are the West’s allies. Iran has been involved in only one war in recent decades, with Iraq. It is widely accepted that Iraq was the instigator of that conflict. I am afraid I cannot judge whether Iran has only a civil nuclear programme, but the claims about Iraq proved to be unfounded.  There is a certain irony in the fact that many of Iran’s critics, the United States and Israel among them, have been involved in conflicts in the past and have nuclear weapons. I am sceptical about the foreign policy priorities of the United States, though I must say the present administration is showing more restraint than its republican predecessor. I am no supporter of the European External Action Service or of the position of High Representative. However, if an agreement between the United States and Iran, encouraged by Baroness Ashton, prevents conflict and normalises relations it, and she, must be applauded. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, to find out what a meeting is about, it is sometimes necessary to put together different sources as though they were pieces in an intricate jigsaw. The agenda of the forthcoming meeting refers to the European Semester which, among other things, includes inspection by the Commission of reform programmes, including reforms of the labour market. The agenda also mentions industrial competitiveness and the importance of a strong and competitive industrial base as a driver for economic growth and jobs. If we refer back to a meeting of ECOFIN, held on 16[nbsp ]February[nbsp ]2012, about the European Semester of that year, we find that ‘reforms need to focus on labour markets – in particular wage-setting mechanisms – to ensure efficient adjustment of labour costs’. What does all this mean? It means that a relatively high-wage economy, or group of economies, embracing the ideology of globalism and the process of globalisation, must drive down wages to compete with the emergent economies.

 Mr President, the present crisis in Ukraine did not start with a Russian invasion. It started with the EU’s reaction to Ukraine’s rejection of the EU-Ukrainian trade deal. This reaction took the form of the EU’s friends in that country exploiting Ukrainian nationalists to provide paramilitary assistance on the streets. I am no supporter of Mr Yanukovych, of his political or personal background or his tactics against demonstrators. However, the Ukrainian Parliament does not have the power simply to remove the president under Article 108, and it does not appear that the impeachment procedures under Article 111 were followed. The EU is determined to ensnare Ukraine by bribery and intimidation. I certainly do not view the presence of Russian troops in the Ukraine with equanimity; I would like them to withdraw. However, Russia is reacting to extreme acts of provocation, not just by the EU but also the US. We know this … (The President cut off the speaker) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, Mr Cercas’s report explains succinctly the formula being applied to the countries investigated: wage freezes and cuts, cuts in welfare spending, part-time and temporary work, and involuntary emigration. It then leaps to three laudable objectives: increased employment, reduction in poverty and reduction in school drop-out rates. It quite rightly calls for an end to austerity. You do not make people richer or reduce their indebtedness by making them poorer. However, its other recommendations lack substance or definition and amount to a prayer for things to improve. It shies away from the root cause: the fact that the euro’s value is too high for their economies. Only withdrawal from the eurozone and a reintroduction of their national currencies, which will fall in value, will allow them to enjoy export-led expansions. The austerity programmes were designed to save the eurozone; they were not designed to help the four countries concerned. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, I am not an EU enthusiast at all, and I can see even less justification for the EU to facilitate investment in countries beyond its borders. In the case of countries in Eastern Europe, I suppose it can be seen as a bribe to lure them into becoming candidate countries and surrendering their sovereignty. North African countries, of course, are not eligible to be members, at least under present rules, but their receipt of investment is a sign that the EU is not so much a European Union as a global union in waiting. There will undoubtedly be people in the still-crisis-ridden states of the South who wonder why all such available money is not being invested there. The answer might be that investment will be less effective in those countries when expansion is constrained by a currency that is overvalued for their economies. Indeed, withdrawal from the eurozone for those countries would be a prerequisite for effective investment. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, the existence of the EIB is justified on the grounds of perceived need. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) bemoans the fact that there was a lack of sustainable and viable projects that were eligible for EIB funding. It appears that the EIB criteria did not match the investment need. There is certainly a need for investment in infrastructure in the Member States. However, investment can be carried out more cheaply, more efficiently and in a more targeted way by those Member States creating the credit themselves rather than borrowing from external institutions and adding sovereign debt. The principle of ‘what is physically possible must be financially possible’ should be followed. President Obama, no less, when introducing the American Jobs Act, said it was a contradiction for a bridge in Maine to be in need of repair while construction workers were unemployed. However, the resolution of that contradiction seems to have eluded him. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, the explanatory memorandum in Ms[nbsp ]Zuberʼs report says that the effects of austerity in Greece, Ireland, Portugal and elsewhere are that women are suffering disproportionately, but of course all workers are suffering from those measures, not just women. The urgent need is to end the austerity programmes she refers to, and membership of the euro area which is the thing that they are supposed to sustain. When those countries benefit from an export-led expansion following withdrawal from the euro area, there will indeed be prosperity to be divided fairly between men and women, which must happen. To seek to divide austerity fairly is to exonerate its architects from responsibility and distract attention from the cause of their suffering. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, in my first debate in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) five years ago, a noblewoman of Liberal persuasion convinced herself that I did not know the difference between people travelling with or without a visa, on the one hand, and immigrants on the other. I think that I remarked that I did know the difference but sometimes the travellers did not.  People who travel from poor countries to relatively rich ones are not always scrupulously honest about their purposes for, or the intended length of, their visit. In a recent debate in LIBE, a representative of the Commission warned against confusing visa facilitation and visa liberalisation and said that easing the procedure for obtaining the visa, as distinct from waiving it, would not allow the visa holder to overstay. The visa overstayer, he implied, would be waiting in the place he was supposed to have been for the authorities to collect him and return him to his own country.  I have heard the Commission accused of many things but I did not think that naivety was among them. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, in the eyes of the EU all rights are equal but some are more equal than others. In any democracy the political rights – freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and electoral rights – should be pre-eminent. Why? Because they are the key to all the others: their recognition, their extent and their limitations. Indeed many of the personal rights were established only with the exercise of these political rights. However, the EU regards the personal rights – chosen or determined behaviour, freedom from constraint, prohibition of discrimination, freedom of movement – to be paramount. If there should be a conflict between, say, freedom of expression and one of these personal rights, freedom of expression would be the loser. What they are really saying is that the political rights were simply vehicles for campaigning for their range of personal rights. Once these have been elevated to the status of having self-evident virtue, the political rights have served their use and have become redundant. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, this report starts innocently enough by referring to conditions of entry for ostensibly short-term visitors, such as exchange pupils or au[nbsp ]pairs. Then the pretences are cast aside and it admits that it is just a prelude to large-scale permanent immigration, eleven million in the current decade. Why? The pretext is Europe’s ageing population caused, in part, by women’s enslavement to economic forces and subservience to anti-family propaganda. The report envisages ‘third-country’, for which you can often read Third World, immigrants with their large families becoming replacement Europeans. Well, they won’t. They will continue to turn more and more parts of Europe into the Third World. You cannot change a person’s identity by changing his or her country or continent of residence. Furthermore, you do not help poorer countries by robbing them of their most skilled and able workers.

... long list of occupations here, they are not just students and researchers, but in fact the following paragraph mentions quite separately that Europe today has an ageing population and needs immigration.

 Madam President, when the history of the 21st century is written it could be remembered as the one in which Europeans were ethnically cleansed from large parts of their homelands. Within my lifetime large parts of the cities of many countries in the West have been transformed into outposts of Africa and Asia. By the end of the century the East will probably be transformed in the same way.  Now it has not happened autonomously like the wind and tides; it has been brought about deliberately by the people who misrule us: the political class. When the peoples of Europe are no longer the pre-eminent populations our distinctive culture will be no more. Distinctive peoples are not the product of distinctive cultures; distinctive cultures are the product of distinctive peoples. Demographic change is not just about numbers and space. It is about the identities of the peoples doing the replacing and the people being replaced. There is still time for Europeans nationally, and in cooperation, to alter their destiny and take control of their own future. It will require moral courage, determination and resolution.

 Mr President, if you start with the premise that admitting seasonal workers was an economic necessity and would happen anyway, there might be something to be said for at least part of this report. The conditions of work of the seasonal workers in Rosarno, where we went in 2010, were truly appalling. Allowing those sorts of conditions, wages and accommodation to be tolerated would be inhumane and would encourage employers to hire third-country workers before home or EU workers. However, allowing third-country workers to apply from within the EU for seasonal work would reward illegal migrants and encourage the entry of more. Allowing people admitted for another purpose to apply would invite abuse of the admission system.  Nine to twelve months is more than a season. I should like to see the evidence for the conclusion that national and other EU workers would be unwilling to take seasonal work. Many long-term unemployed would be pleased to have paid work with accommodation provided in their own country, or at least in their own continent. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, the ethnic and religious conflict is obviously the most pressing problem, but in a way it distracts us from the underlying long-term problems of poverty, a lack of economic development and a fragile civic infrastructure. We must understand the nature of these problems if they are to be solved.  Now these problems are not just the product of the decades following independence or, for that matter, of the colonial experience. Despite being rich in natural resources and having favourable agricultural conditions, the CAR is one of the world’s poorest countries. We might ask why the area of the Central African Republic, and the rest of sub-Saharan Africa for that matter, did not develop the instruments of technology and transport and use them to spread the fruits of their discoveries, learning and creativity throughout the world in the way that Europe did. If there has been, and continues to be, a hindrance to development it must be identified and addressed. When we address that question honestly we might be ready to start solving Africa’s problems.

 Mr President, insider dealing and market manipulation are undoubtedly wrong and harm countless numbers of people. They are not victimless crimes and should be subject to criminal sanctions. The argument is that when a market becomes international, the regulation must also become international. From that it is concluded that EU legislation is called for – surprise, surprise. There is a slight flaw in the logic or at least in one of the premises. The terms EU and international are not synonymous. What is required is an international treaty, signed by all significant trading countries, to the effect that the signatory countries will legislate for stated minimum standards of legislation. In this example, as in many others, EU harmonising legislation is the objective and the prevention of insider dealer and market manipulation is simply the pretext. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, if you start from a position of 28 countries locked into the EU, and all of them locked into the global trade system governed by the World Trade Organisation, you might be forgiven for thinking that there was some merit in the Commission’s proposal, for example, to modify the lesser duty rule, or to impose provisional duties after establishing proof of what even the EU would consider to be dumping. However, I am tempted to take the part of the man in the joke who, when asked for directions, replied: ‘I would not have started from here.’  I am opposed to EU controls over my country’s ability to manage its own trade. However, I am even more concerned about the EU and the WTO facilitating trade with low-wage economies with whose manufactured goods we cannot possibly compete, and which constitute dumping, without any investigation being necessary.

 Mr President, for a tax to attract one or two non-partisan critics would be unfortunate. To attract dozens sounds a bit like carelessness. The tax is superficially appealing as a levy on institutions blamed for the recession: a tax on the rich to benefit the poor. But, as one critic said: banks simply pass down their taxes to us, the customers. Indeed, the FTT would be levied most heavily on long-term investments such as those of pension funds. The good news is that it will be levied in only eleven countries. The bad news is that it might be drafted in a way that would catch some transactions in countries that have rejected it.  There is reason to believe that its imposition, even at a modest level, would lead to the migration of funds to countries beyond those participating in it. If it were ever to be imposed on all 28 Member States, funds would migrate to New York and elsewhere. Remember: the FTT is the chosen instrument to be an EU own-resources tax.

 Mr President, I am not in favour of freedom of movement, in principle: sovereign states should be able to admit, or refuse to admit, whom they wish. When it applies between countries with widely different wage levels, it leaves the source country devoid of valuable labour and the destination country with home workers jobless.  But the problem is aggravated when third-country citizens abuse the procedure by gaining access using forged and stolen documents, sham marriages and even proxy marriages. We are told that the procedure for authenticating documents is time-consuming and troublesome. It needs to be. The British Home Secretary submitted a document showing the extent of the fraud to the Commission in December, but it is yet to be revealed to the public. The report sees freedom of movement to be not just a right, but an expectation. Those promoting it are trying to eradicate national identity and, by encouraging third-party or third-country nationals, they are seeking to eradicate the identity of Europe too.

 Madam President, the cause of homelessness, which is unmentionable by the silent conspiracy of liberal consensus, is immigration and asylum. Every person or family entering a country adds to the demand for housing by one. If there are homeless among the indigenous population, a house provided for a new arrival is a house denied to an existing resident. The decision-takers – MEPs, MPs, local councillors – are not among the homeless. Indeed, most of them cannot count any homeless among their circle of acquaintances. To them, the homeless are just statistics and not real people. Decision-takers feel terribly generous for granting a home to a newcomer, but funnily enough they do not feel mean for denying one to an existing resident. We heard this morning from UKIP that it was opposed to mass immigration. However, its leader said recently ‘we want immigration, we welcome immigration’. In 2010, he said that the UK needed 250 000 every year. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr Farage recently said that Bulgarians and Romanians were responsible for a lot of crime in London.

Mr President, the Lithuanian Presidency claims credit for progress on the Banking Union and enhanced EU control over the economies of Member States, especially those in the eurozone, as though these were simply means of achieving economic well-being. However, these are not a means to an end, but rather an end in itself: centralised control of Member States. The Presidency has boasted of its achievements on hate crime, which properly refers to criminal acts, violence, abuse and property damage motivated by hatred of a particular category of people, and should always be deplored. Hatred is always destructive of the hater as well as the hated. However, assaults and extreme violence and damage motivated by hatred and contempt are not perpetrated only – or even mainly – by the indigenous populations of Europe against ethnic minorities, as we know from the cases of Lee Rigby in London, those of Kriss Donald and Richard Everitt, the London riots in 2011 and the countless victims of Asian grooming. Lithuania boasts of hosting a conference in November of the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), which believes in the criminalisation of disapproved expressions of opinion on ethnicity, including racism – a word undefined but coined by Trotsky – and xenophobia, which can only be described as an Orwellian thought crime. Ironically, the application of these words to political opponents – a favourite activity of the FRA and Eurocrats – is a subliminal message of hatred: stop reading, stop listening, stop judging for yourself; hate the speaker, hate the writer.

 Mr President, given that national legislation is insufficient, this proposal is ostensibly to protect consumers. Yet the more you read, the more you realise that consumer protection is not wanted primarily for its own sake but because it will facilitate free trade. It seems that cutting the budget would not be acceptable. No surprise there! In the context of product safety, the report does contain some interesting revelations. In 2010, 58 % of notifications were in respect of goods from China, and in 16 % of cases it was not possible to identify the country of the manufacturer. Alarmingly, 25 % of notifications concerned toys. The drive to extend free trade worldwide without regard for the job security of Europeans is well documented. However, it seems that consumer safety has also been a victim of international free trade. The countries of Europe, individually or collectively, cannot deal with countries that habitually sell us unsafe or substandard goods. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI
). -  
Madam President, I am not reassured that this proposal is not protectionist, because that is exactly what it ought to be. The countries of Europe, individually or collectively, ought to protect their jobs and their businesses. The question which has not been asked is whether it is in the interests of any country or trading bloc, if you will, to open its public procurement market to other countries or blocs. Public expenditure is ultimately funded by domestic taxes, but if it generates economic activity – and it does – it should be for the benefit of that country or those countries’ own peoples. The report confirms that market access by companies from third countries is part of the common commercial policy which falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The EU’s wish to maximise international access to these markets shows that the EU is not so much a European Union as a global union in waiting. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr Farage, you claim – or you imply – that you are against immigration. On 4 May 2010, on the Daily Politics show, you said that Britain should issue 250 000 work permits each year.

 Mr President, yes, the Commission wants to see more single market competition for defence procurement on the ground that fragmented markets create red tape and duplication of defence programmes. It is not fragmentation that leads to red tape; it is the EU requirement that defence contracts should be put out to tender.  Britain could, of course ironically, use the Lisbon Treaty to avoid tendering on the ground of protecting its national interest, as Poland has done to its great credit. The Commission will tackle what it calls market distortions, which will probably take away the rights of Member States to protect their national interest in this area. Defence is too important to the national interest to allow free market competition.  Whilst another European war is, we all hope, unthinkable, our world interests might diverge; the UK cannot be dependent for equipment procurement on states opposed, say, to our protecting the Falklands from Argentinian aggression.

Mr President, in paragraph 13 the rapporteurs express their dislike of Member States excluding themselves from treaties or legislation from the outset, and would prefer legislation to allow for derogations later. This effectively makes the default position that all treaties and legislation should apply to all Member States unless they negotiate an opt-out and only, of course, for as long as they retain it. However, the express disapproval of derogations is intended to make them an exceptional and shameful procedure for which Member States should feel properly contrite. This means that agreements and legislation concerning the euro and instruments to serve it will apply to Britain and other non-euro countries unless they and Britain ask for a derogation: in other words, control of our economy unless the government asks for an opt-out. This would allow Member State governments that are indolent, or perhaps less eurosceptic than they pretend to be, to extend the EU’s control…  (The President cut off the speaker) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, it is tempting to applaud the proposals for increasing the power of Parliament and increasing the accountability of the President of the European Council to it. Equally, it is easy to deprecate the behaviour of the European Council in trying to extend its role. If I were an enthusiast for the EU project, I would succumb to both temptations. However, I am not so I shall not. Do I look at the European Council through rose-tinted spectacles? No. My view of some of their members might involve unparliamentary language. However, whatever I think of particular members of the European Council, its members represent Member States and are ultimately responsible to their electorates and removable by them. The Parliament, whatever its merits, is not responsible to a single electorate with a consciousness of its identity so it cannot take a conscious collective decision as to the choice of Commission President. Indeed its decision will look like the decision of a Ouija board. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the general objective of the programme is to develop further mutual recognition by promoting judicial cooperation in criminal and civil matters. It all sounds rather splendid until, of course, the difficulties are examined. There are enormous differences in substantive law and trial procedure between Member States, and even within them. However, there are also differences in legal culture between the common law and continental systems, with particular reference to freedoms to act. The starting presumption in common law is that persons have the freedom to do whatever is not prohibited by law. The starting position in many continental countries is that rights are created by proclamation and can be easily defined. Whilst even in common law systems they can be defined negatively and repressively, the jury system is a safeguard against legislation and prosecutions that are considered to be unreasonable. We can see how this difference manifests itself in practice: many continental countries restrict freedom of expression in an extreme, obsessive and quite insane way. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, we have the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide but toleration of political repression at home in the EU, selective registration of European parties, party bans and attempted bans on fabricated evidence, the arrest of opposition MPs on trumped-up charges, prosecution meaning even imprisonment for heretical opinion, and even thought crime. Can democracy and human rights be implanted and nurtured even in unpromising soil? It is difficult to prevent it from being corrupted and undermined even in its ancestral home.  Countries with strong vertical divisions have difficulty in making it work. In countries with inflexible and intolerant religious ideologies, democracy can bring social repression for women and religious minorities. It is often thought that social liberalism and observance of human rights complement democracy. However, sometimes politically repressive regimes are socially liberal. There are indispensable social preconditions for democracy to develop and survive but they cannot be bought and paid for from outside. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the long-term prospects for British fishermen depend on withdrawal from the EU, but of course fishermen want solutions to current and immediate problems. We are told that the discard policy involving fish that cannot survive will of course be discontinued, but the survivability rate is said to be higher with some species. There must be research-led distinctions between treatment of different species. Avoidance of by-catch waste is a welcome theme of the Stevenson report, with adult commercial fish to be allowed onto the open market and the remaining by-catch being used for some other commercial purpose: fish meal, pet food, etc. In the end, by-catches must be reduced, possibly with gear that distinguishes between different sizes for selective catch and release, such as the pot-trap developed by my constituent Mr Jeff Stockdale in 2009. Information to consumers is always to be welcomed but the original requirements for gear type, fish stock and flag state might have been excessively costly. That the supply of this information will be voluntary is to be welcomed. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, some in my country would say that Britain in the EU is not British enough, and they would be right. But I would say that the European Union is not European enough. The immigration policies of Western Member States and the embryonic EU policy have brought third world populations to Europe and have turned parts of Europe into the third world. Identities are the product of ancestry and history, not of culture or legal contrivance. The EU does not have a European economic protectionist policy. It has a globalist policy designed to move by gradual degrees to a world economy with a common wage level and standard of living. There are genuine Europhiles, but the Eurocrats are not among them. They are cosmopolitans. Ironically, the main media-created, pretend Eurosceptic party in the UK is in favour of a quarter of a million immigrants each year and embraces globalism and global free trade.

 Mr President, agriculture is unlike any other industry because of the inelasticity of its demand and supply. That makes public-sector support absolutely indispensable. But that support ought to be Member State support and not EU support. The UK receives the smallest share of common agricultural policy funding of any Member State. The EU’s embrace of neo-liberalism opens the door to trade agreements that force Europe’s farmers to face dangerous competition. That same philosophy allows supermarkets to treat farmers as though they were their own outworkers. The multitude of farmers face the tyranny of few buyers, which is a classic example of what an economist would call an oligopsony. We have been warned about a re-nationalisation of agricultural policy. If only that were the case! What we need is abolition of the CAP, not its reform. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, money by itself does not produce intellectual inspiration. That is to be found in what a Commission 2020 document described as a ‘talented and creative populationʼ. That is Europeans, if you were wondering. Indeed, a disproportionately large number of inventions and innovations come from Europe in general, and from a country that modesty prevents me from mentioning in particular. Perhaps ensuring the survival of those talented populations from the replacement from which they are now suffering would be the best way of encouraging and nurturing inventiveness. There are some other populations in the world that have been most cruelly deprived of their fair share of those gifts. Does the public sector, preferably at Member State level, have a role to play? Historically, neither inventions nor innovations receive public funds. However, subsidies are contagious and countries and trading blocs that need to compete must match the subsidies of their rivals. Will research and development ensure that we can compete? Not if the wage levels of competitors are a fraction of our own, or if the elite talent of our competitors is to copy our innovations in breach of patent rights. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the report on the interinstitutional agreement is highly critical of the length of the negotiations within the Council and between the institutions. But the money that is the subject of negotiation is taxpayers’ money, and its expenditure must be given due consideration. The rapporteur is keen that Parliament’s legislative and budgetary powers granted by the Treaty of Lisbon should be fully respected. The report is critical of the Council for binding itself to the conclusions of the European Council.  It is true that Parliament is the only directly elected body and it seems at first sight right that it should be pre-eminent in the budgetary process. However, most of the money spent by the EU comes from or through Member States, and Member States’ governments are, in the eyes of their electorates, held responsible to their electorates for their taxpayers’ money. Parliament might be constitutionally responsible to a theoretical European electorate, but that electorate is not conscious even of its own existence as an entity. There is little dialogue between MEPs and their electors about the precise allocation of funds as distinct from the total amount.  The European Council – unlike the Council – does not have an official legislative role, but as the body representing Heads of Government its members are much more aware of the views of their citizens on expenditure than are MEPs. For as long as the EU continues they must have an important say in the negotiating process. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, this agenda is a distraction from the real causes of unemployment and the lack of growth. They include restrictive budgetary policies, cheap foreign imports from emergent economies, domestic earned income being invested abroad, and the outsourcing of jobs. But the cause of unemployment which is the real taboo is immigration, especially immigration from the Third World. Their migrants are assisted by anti-discrimination laws, while what we really need are native population preference laws, so that each country’s nationals could go to the top of the employment list. Immigration should be on the agenda as one of the causes of unemployment. In the UK, we have an establishment safety-valve party that would pretend to be opposed to mass immigration, but on 4 May 2010, its leader, Mr Farage, said that the UK should issue a quarter of a million work permits each year.

Mr President, I am sure that the High Representative will be believed when she says she wants to promote democracy and the rule of law throughout the world. I am not an enthusiast for her position, but she rightly challenges and criticises countries that imprison opposition leaders on spurious or doubtful pretexts. Of course, this does not just take place in former Soviet Republics or unstable regimes of the Middle East or Africa; it can also happen in Member States. Only a few weeks ago we saw several MP’s of Greece’s third-strongest party arrested and detained on a ‘sovietesque’ charge of founding a criminal organisation. They are not, apparently, charged with complicity in the despicable murder of a left-wing activist, but their party has been transformed into a criminal organisation over night. I know nothing directly about Golden Dawn, and I certainly do not look at them through rose-tinted spectacles. But the rule of law cannot be observed selectively.

 Mr President, if the EU needs to know whether the single market has been a success, it need only look at organised crime. The removal of international borders and visa-free travel make detection much less likely. The creation of a single currency could have been invented by money launderers – possibly it was. Of course, money laundering is not always obviously a cross-border activity. The UK is full of micro and small businesses which deal with cash customers and survive only by divine providence. Indeed, the hand of God – or at least one of his alternatives – must be responsible, because the tiny number of customers they have could not sustain them. The products that they sell in limited quantities are varieties of fast food and taxi rides. The trafficked products and people that they sell on a grander and more profitable scale are the products and services that dare not speak their name. Organised crime is a real problem, and this report has some merit. But it is being used to justify yet more EU centralisation and control, more harmonisation and, of course, use of the EU’s public prosecutor’s office. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, the rapporteur protests in this document that there is no protectionist aim whatsoever, as though the word ‘protectionist’ might be one of those hate labels – like ‘racist’ – that are so popular with cosmopolitans. The rapporteur is using the word ‘protectionist’ in its strict economic sense, referring to tariff and non-tariff barriers to international trade. However, if he had been using it in a more general and everyday sense, his denial would be equally valid. The EU is emphatically not trying to protect Europe’s interests, still less the interests of its Member States. The objective is to follow the World Trade Organisation’s globalist agenda. Retaliation would not be used to protect Europe’s economic interests but to enforce observance of the WTO’s globalist rules. The theory of international trade is that unrestricted trade makes the world as a whole richer. However, even if that were always the case, it would not follow that it made everybody or every country richer too. The free movement of goods and services, capital and labour – which is of course what all globalists, including EU globalists, are driving for – can only work if prices and wages are on undifferentiated scales. If that happens, the developed world, including Europe, has everything to lose. The third world and emergent economies have everything to gain.

Mr President, we have heard from the Commissioner that there ought to be respect for the rule of law in Russia, that people should not be condemned without a distinct breach of the law established by the ordinary courts. But we heard only yesterday from the Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, no less, that people accused of an undoubtedly horrific murder in Greece could be regarded as guilty before any trial. Even people perceived as being beyond the pale must be treated with respect for the rule of law.  Before we point the finger at Russia, Members of this Parliament should look into their own conduct. We have heard that Russia is restricting freedom of expression. If it is, that will be reprehensible. However, many EU Member States lock people up for expressing opinions that do not have any hint of violence. Indeed, Commissioner Reding would like to go further and criminalise thought crime. I am sure that many Members here have been speaking honesty and from the heart, but I believe that behind this debate is an agenda that has got very little to do with sexuality or freedom of expression: it is about Russia’s foreign policy.

Madam President, the loss of life among illegal migrants in the Mediterranean is of course an appalling tragedy. Improving the rapidity of response to accidents is necessary, but of course is only part of the solution. The main answer is to remove the incentive for them to travel to Europe. We must replace the policy of allowing most of these people to stay with a policy of allowing none of them to stay. When that message gets through to would-be migrants, they will stop taking the risk. Repatriation of illegals really will save lives. The architects of the EU asylum policies, including people in this House, are directly and personally responsible for deaths in the Mediterranean. They should really hang their heads in shame. The logical extension of non-refoulement is a recipe for allowing all Third World illegal migrants to stay. Of course, the real unspoken migratory policy of the EU is to cleanse ethnically the indigenous populations of Europe and replace them with people from the Third World. When that happens, parts of Europe become outposts of the Third World. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, investment, in its simplest form, is the deferral of present consumption in order to facilitate production that will enable greater enrichment in the future. If the people deferring present consumption are the ones to benefit from the future enrichment, all is well and good. However, if the deferred consumption is used to facilitate more efficient production and greater enrichment elsewhere, there has been a mismatch.  That sums up the investment relationship between European countries and China. Europe invests nearly seven times as much in China as China does in Europe. Europe is deferring current consumption to make China a more efficient producer and – of course – competitor. Most of the arguments about trade with and investment in and from China have concentrated on the level playing field argument: a removal of tariff barriers, getting China to improve working conditions, paying attention to environmental concerns and ending counterfeiting. No attention has been paid to the question of whether we should be helping a potentially enormous emerging economy to compete with the developed world for scarce resources, compete with our industries and, possibly, direct its newfound industrial wealth into even greater military capability. The West insists on being globalist – to its own detriment – when dealing with China which, whatever its lip service to Marxist rhetoric, is in fact an economic nationalist state.

Madam President, the EU has a trade deficit with Taiwan but it has a surplus in services. The UK has a substantial trade deficit with Taiwan, a ratio of almost 3:1, which has undermined and is continuing to undermine British industry. Our surplus in services is diminishing year by year. UK investment in Taiwan dwarfs Taiwan’s investment in Britain by a factor of almost 4:1. Thus British capital, deferred consumption if you like, is financing competition from Taiwan. Furthermore, that country is investing in low-wage economies in the Far East that will also compete with all of our industries.  The rapporteurs are not commending trade with Taiwan pragmatically because it benefits the EU: they commend it because it advances the WTO objective of open trade worldwide. The EU is not pursuing European objectives, but global objectives. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, MPs must not be above the law, especially if they are implicated in crimes of violence. However, the arrest of six Greek MPs, including their party leader, at the behest of the government, only days after violent protests against their party by left-wing demonstrators following the horrific stabbing of a left-wing activist, must give us cause for concern We must think of what Pastor Martin Niemöller might have said: ‘First they came for Golden Dawn, and I did not speak out because it was not my party.’ These were the first arrests of MPs in Greece since the fall of the infamous Colonels’ dictatorship in 1974. Whatever we might think of that party, no evidence has been cited of a connection between the alleged murderer and the MPs and it appears that the arrests took place to assuage the anger of violent demonstrators. I am sure that, if the Hungarian Government had imprisoned opposition MPs instead of just tinkering with the constitution, we would have held non-stop debates. Democratic rights are not to be granted or withheld at the whim of government. We must always be sceptical when governments imprison oppositions. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, we are used to the EU using the crisis as a pretext for greater integration of Member States’ economies: it is now being used as a pretext for pooling defence industries and capabilities. Apparently, surrender of the ability to take independent action is a panacea for all ills. Sovereign states that lose their own capabilities and defence industries cease to be sovereign. Supranational bodies that gain a capacity to wage war without the express consent of member countries become, by stealth, sovereign states. But of course that is the idea. The report seems to look back at previous involvement in conflicts with a degree of nostalgia and bemoans the fact that the EU does not have a clear common security and defence policy. It refers with approval to the 2008 European Council meeting at which the objective was set to be capable of deploying a force of 60 000 in 60 days. I am afraid I cannot be sanguine about the possibility of a trigger-happy EU deploying an army of that size. Alliances such as the EU mutual defence clause have the potential for transforming a localised conflict into a world war. If we doubt it, think of 1914. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, unemployment is caused by a single currency that is overvalued for the countries of the South where youth unemployment is at its highest. It is caused by high energy costs because of the EU’s mad dash for renewables. The EU’s energy costs are between twice and four times those of the United States. It is also caused by the EU’s embrace of globalisation and unlimited trade with low-wage economies. Last but not least, it is caused by unrestricted immigration.  Mr Nuttall’s hypocrisy on this was astounding. UKIP’s leader, Mr Farage, has advocated 250 000 work permits to be issued by the UK every year. UKIP is a pro-immigration party like all of the others that have expressed pretended and very recent concerns about it. Youth unemployment is particularly significant because it is even more difficult to find a new job than it is to hold on to an existing one. However, its causes and solutions are not qualitatively different. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, whilst this might not yet apply to the UK, there are issues of wider concern. The substantive content of the proposal is completely sound. Suspects should indeed enjoy access to a lawyer as well as the other rights listed. However, in my view, there is no need for EU legislation, and indeed such legislation would not satisfy the need completely. The EU is not – not yet at least – the whole world and people travelling internationally do not restrict their visits to other Member States. What is needed is not EU legislation but an international treaty encompassing as many countries as possible throughout the world, to the effect that the rights listed should apply with reciprocity to all countries that are signatories. I cannot help feeling that this proposal is not so much about the rights of the suspect, with EU legislation being the means. It is much more about extending EU legislation competence and the rights of the suspect are simply a means to an end. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, this Presidency will be even more inspired by the EU and less by the presiding country because unusually the key player will be the President rather than the Prime Minister. Why? Because the President is a former commissioner with an EU mindset. There will be more of the same: single market, banking union, neo-liberal global free trade, talk about growth and unemployment without considering the conditions for the first or the causes of the second. The Eastern Partnership is of particular interest. We are told that the politically inspired prosecution of Yulia Tymoshenko has affected relations with Ukraine. I look forward to the politically inspired prosecution of Marine Le Pen affecting relations with France.  The most important players in the EU project are invited to Bilderberg conferences. I wonder whether the Lithuanian President was invited this year. If not, why not? I think we should be told. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, there is sometimes a presumption that if we have done nothing wrong, we have nothing to fear from surveillance. However, there is evidence that security services collect political information that is not concerned with the committing of criminal offences. Sometimes they collect personal information unconnected with politics – perhaps to create leverage over individuals. Furthermore, they do not only collect information but also sometimes engage in disruptive action on the basis of that information. We know all of this from the revelations in 2011 about the activities of a British police officer, Mark Kennedy, who infiltrated Green protest groups. Some states – the United Kingdom is a particular example – practise formal and systematic discrimination against members of named political parties. A Merseyside police officer lost his career in 2009 as the result of alleged membership of a perfectly legal but heretical political party. I will stop there. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, increased mobility is not so much a cure for youth unemployment as it is a cause, at least in the West. Unemployment in the South is caused directly by a euro that is over-valued for those countries, but the European Council is determined to keep on expanding the zone. The European Council wants to improve growth and competitiveness, but the EU’s energy policy pushes up energy costs, making industry less competitive. It even provides incentives for manufacturers like Corus near Middlesbrough to move production to India. Immigration – two thirds of it from outside the EU in the case of the UK – is giving our jobs to people from outside. Increasing globalism will make industry in the EU try unsuccessfully to compete with emergent economies. The European Council does not so much have a cure for the recession, it is part of the problem. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the authors of this report seem not to appreciate the irony of their calls for restrictions on freedom of speech in protection of fundamental rights. To justify themselves, they use the emotive term ‘hate speech’. Hatred is an ugly word because it is an ugly concept.  We know from the experience of France how low the threshold can be. The mere careless choice of words, such as ‘detail’ or ‘debate’, can land you in court. The FN presidential candidate in 2012 is now being prosecuted for drawing parallels between military and migratory occupation. Has Hungary, under the present government, prosecuted any opposition, presidential or other candidates? Has Hungary banned any political parties, as Belgium did in 2004? Has it attempted to ban a political party using evidence fabricated by the security services, as Germany did in 2001? Has Hungary, under the present government, acted like its predecessor in 2006 and sent armed police to attack peaceful demonstrators? Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, bonuses awarded in the fund management sector are certainly high. It is difficult to justify them morally and it is always tempting to want to do something about them. I am certainly tempted to do so. But we have got to look at this rationally. A restriction on bonuses would inevitably lead to compensatory increases in basic income. That would be worse because, of course, basic salaries – unlike bonuses – cannot easily be reduced to reflect poor performance. Should we then restrict incomes in basic salaries? Well we could, but then we should logically say that perhaps we ought to limit all people’s salaries. Do we really want the EU – or even Member States for that matter – to have that kind of power?  The real problem which needs to be addressed is the high level of expense ratios of investment funds – the amount paid by investors to the funds. In the United States, equity funds charge an average of 0.64%; in Europe most funds charge over 1%. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the implementation of the Compact for Jobs and Growth is to be discussed. If only words were deeds, if only wishes were achievements. The impact of tight budgetary constraint was to be monitored, but it did not act on what it saw. You cannot make a population richer by making it poorer. It promised to promote growth and competitiveness. How do the high-wage economies of Europe compete with the slave-labour wages of the so-called ‘emergent economies’? How do countries with an over-valued currency that cannot be changed unilaterally become more competitive without devaluation?  The single market is seen as a panacea for all ills, but it has facilitated the export of jobs from higher-wage economies to lower-wage economies. Improving training for the unemployed will make individuals better able to compete with their fellows. It might also marginally improve the efficiency of industry and commerce. However, it will not increase the total number of jobs immediately.  Mr Barroso believes confidence is a key to growth. It will be effective only if that confidence is soundly based. However, investors can see that the EU’s embrace of the ideology of globalism will destroy European industry and reward the emergent economies, and they will invest accordingly. Individuals might prefer to invest in their own countries, but their investment funds are, unfortunately, profit maximisers. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, paragraph 12 of the motion for a resolution says that freedom of expression – even if it offends – is at the heart of democracy. I agree absolutely. Physical attacks on peaceful demonstrators should certainly bring Turkey’s application to the EU to a complete halt. We could also mention the attempted prosecution of Mr Orhan Pamuk for a heretical view of Turkish history – but of course, France attempted to enact an almost exact mirror image or converse of that law under which Mr Pamuk was prosecuted. Many other EU countries prosecute and imprison people for heretical, historical or political opinion. The Belgian Government of Mr Verhofstadt actually banned a political party – Vlaams Blok – and Germany tried to ban a party with fabricated evidence. Turkey certainly deserves censure, but EU Member States must put their own houses in order first. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, asylum has got far less to do with shielding people from persecution, and much more to do with serving as a pretext for facilitating immigration.  The political class knows that there is opposition to mass immigration, so they present asylum as a system over which they have no control. If applicants are not detained or allowed to seek work, they will also need housing. Jobs and houses are in short supply, so they will be employed or housed at the expense of the home populations. Perhaps complicit MEPs should open their homes to these applicants and fund them from their salaries, rather than letting the poor and dispossessed bear the burden.  Of course if asylum is refused, the applicant will be given a piece of paper asking them to leave, but there will be no coercion. They can also use the legal system to frustrate removal. An Iranian asylum seeker, Mr Rostami, came to Britain in 2001 and was refused asylum in 2002. He is still in Britain after several appeals, a prison sentence and a deportation order. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the solution to these problems, we are told, is more EU legislation and greater competence for the EU. Unlike the literary character Topsy, organised crime did not just grow: it has been facilitated by the EU. Schengen removed borders for organised crime just as it did for legitimate business. Drugs, arms and trafficked people can be more easily moved. A single currency makes it possible to launder the profits of crime much more easily anywhere in the zone, just as lax immigration controls and connivance with bogus asylum claims allow criminals and sometimes their wares to pass from one country and one continent to another.  Of course, not all organised crime involves crossing frontiers. The predominance of the same distinct population groups both in ostensibly legitimate cash business such as taxi firms and take-away food shops, and in drug dealing and prostitution, allows the profits of the latter to be laundered through the former. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, the substance of this proposal has every merit. People who have been subjected to domestic or other violence or harassment need to be protected wherever they happen to be – their home country, another EU Member State or, for that matter, anywhere in the world. I would be happier with a worldwide treaty to which all well-meaning countries would freely subscribe, recognising protection orders from other countries. To have EU legislation suggests that people move between countries only within the EU. I do not favour EU legislation on principle, but I do accept that it is better for vulnerable people to be partially protected in a form that I do not favour than not to be protected at all. I do not want to facilitate movement of people in the EU, but I do want them to be protected when they do move. Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that sometimes, behind this apparently well-meaning legislation, some people are more interested in the extension of EU legislative competence than they are in the substantive issue.

Madam President, the appalling problem of the millions of external and internal refugees cannot be considered in isolation. Their difficulties will only be overcome when the conflict comes to an end. The problem is, of course, that neither side seems likely to win decisively in the foreseeable future. The conflict is often depicted as being one between incontrovertible good – the opposition – and incontrovertible evil – the Government. In fact, both sides have committed hideous atrocities. The Government is politically repressive but socially secular. Some of the opposition are – or claim to be – both politically and socially liberal. Others, the Islamists, are neither, and they certainly are not secular. Their regime would be more oppressive than Assad’s Syria. The answer is not to provide arms to either side, and it is not to bring the population to neighbouring countries or to Europe. The answer is for the whole international community to urge talks between government and opposition without preconditions – except, of course, for a ceasefire. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, I congratulate Bosnia and Herzegovina on making little progress towards meeting the political criteria. The more resistance a country shows to the EU, the better, in my opinion. In particular it has resisted the move towards a neo-liberal market economy as distinct from simply a private enterprise economy. Apparently, too, little progress has been made towards freedom of movement, for which I might be inclined to congratulate them – until I discovered they are referring to freedom of movement within Bosnia and Herzegovina. If you are a Croat or a Bosniac, you might think twice about travelling through some parts of the Republic of Srpska. There is a coded reference to there being no shared vision. What this means is that the population is split three ways and political cooperation is minimal. Would it really be desirable to bring such a divided country into the EU? There is of course a lesson for us. A vertically-divided state is ungovernable, as Swedes in Stockholm must be concluding at this very moment. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, it is the Member States that have the responsibility to collect taxes and fight fraud, yet here the EU is trying to extend its legislative competence. It is obviously true that fraud is often committed across international borders, often by the multinationals that are so beloved by the EU’s neo-liberal policies. But ‘borders’ means all borders, and not just the borders of Member States. Action needs to be by extensive international agreement and not confined to the EU. On another subject, to talk about growth, jobs and competitiveness in the context of the EU’s energy policy is wildly optimistic. Renewable energy might well be a desirable ideal, but it is inefficient and expensive. High energy costs will not create growth, jobs and competitiveness, they will destroy them. Suppliers of energy wishing to use fossil fuels are penalised financially, and those plants will eventually be closed down. To make matters worse, emergent countries seem to be immune from strictures against the use of fossil fuels. In the UK we have vast quantities of oil locked in the ground as the result of Mrs Thatcher’s policies in the 1980s. We must discard our prejudices against fossil fuels and against nuclear energy. They will be the key to growth and jobs. The difficulty facing the eurozone will doubtless come up. Perhaps they might heed the words of Oscar Lafontaine and begin an orderly dismantling of the eurozone. Only escape from the eurozone will rescue the troubled economies of the South from permanent stagnation. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, the terms ‘pro-European’ and ‘anti-European’ are often used as shorthand for ‘pro-EU’ and ‘anti-EU’. I for one find the use of the term ‘anti-European’ to describe those of us who are opposed to EU membership, or even the existence of the EU, as highly offensive. Europe is much older and much more than the EU; it is a cultural entity, a religious entity and an entity with overlapping and related ancestries. The EU goes out of its way to welcome third-world immigration and embraces the political and economic doctrine of globalism. It is the EU that is anti-European because its policies will eventually destroy the distinctiveness of Europe. If third-world immigrants come to Europe they do not become new Europeans to replace unborn European babies, they turn parts of Europe irreversibly into the third world. It is global capitalism and the related political ideologies that fuel immigration because it regards human beings as though they were merely facts of production. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, thank you. Twenty-two years ago, Croatia fought for and eventually won its independence, for which it paid with the lives of many of its nationals. That independence has now been surrendered to the European Union. To add insult to injury, Croatia has had to pay to be allowed to surrender. Part of this price was handing over two of its generals, Generals Markac and Gotovina, to the UN War Crimes Tribunal so that they could be stigmatised – quite unjustly, as it turns out – as war criminals. Croatia is praised in the report for its democratic consolidation. Let us hope that democracy is contagious and that it spreads to the EU and its worst Member States. Croatia has been told that it must respect the rights of minorities. If some Croats have problems with minorities at present, then, in the words of Al Jolson: ‘you ain’t seen nothin’ yet’. Wait until the poor of Africa and Asia, admitted by the EU through its common immigration policy, turn up in your towns and cities and outnumber your tiny population. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, Turkey certainly abuses human rights when it prosecutes academics for expressing opinions, such as describing the 1915 killing of Armenians as genocide. Of course Turkey is not alone. France proposes an exact mirror image of that law. People will be prosecuted for saying that it was not genocide. France and many other Member States prosecute and jail people for heretical opinions, so perhaps Turkey might fit in after all. I am not an enthusiast for the European Union, but for as long as it exists, I prefer it to be more European rather than less European. Turkey is not European by its geography, ancestry, religion or culture. Whilst not being an EU enthusiast, I really find it extraordinary that a country that is still occupying nearly 40% of Cyprus should even be considered for membership. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the Prime Minister’s statement was preceded by a speech on 26 March. He spoke of the uniqueness of Europe’s regional integration being based on supposed common values. The EU talks about democracy and freedom of expression, but then it and its Member States seek to jail people for exercising that right. The values for which the EU is most enthusiastic are those of social liberalism; consensus values only amongst social liberals. He then revealed that regional integration was on the agenda all over the world. He might have said it was on the same agenda drawn up by the same people. What will this regional integration achieve? It will promote trade and remove barriers to trade not only within each region, but between regions. In that trade, Europe must be competitive, we are told. He implied strongly that labour costs would have to be curbed or even lowered. (The President cut off the speaker) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, the eurozone and the ECB are not a solution to the difficulties of the European Union; they are part of the problem. During the early years of the eurozone, northern Europe needed low interest rates to improve its growth. However, those low interest rates caused a property boom in Spain. When that boom came to an end, the banks found that they had insufficient security for their loans. In 2011, the ECB conducted two distinct and contradictory interest rate policies. The answer is that a common interest rate, like a common currency value, cannot be appropriate for 17 different economies. The report suggests that there ought to be wage increases in the north of the EU in order to stimulate aggregate demand in the south. However, would you encourage employers to increase wages above the market rate? They will certainly not be encouraged to do so when there is a plentiful supply of labour resulting from an open-door policy on immigration, nor will they do so when they have the freedom to export jobs to the Far East by relocating industry. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, unemployment is not falling, and is unlikely to do so in 2013. The value of the euro will not allow the countries of the south to emerge from recession. Austerity programmes will not cure unemployment. You do not make countries richer by making them poorer. Globalisation might make the emergent economies richer, but it will make European countries poorer. The single market might help low income Member States, but only at the expense of higher income Member States.  Uncontrolled immigration will make unemployment even worse. We heard earlier from a Mr Farage about immigration. Is that the same Mr Farage who said in 2010, on 4 May, that the UK ought to issue a quarter of a million work permits each year? Incidentally, the Romanian citizens he was referring to were not ordinary Romanians, they were Roma. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, Syria is, of course, anything but a democracy, but not many countries in the Middle East are, including of course its fiercest critic, Saudi Arabia. Nor for that matter are all of Mr Assad’s opponents in Syria democrats.  The Syrian government’s handling of the protest was, from the beginning, grossly disproportionate, but its brutality has sometimes been matched by the opposition. We can judge a regime also by its substantive policies. Before the conflict, women were relatively liberated in Syria. Religious minorities, particularly Christians, were free to worship without interference, although, of course, some Christians have been attacked by Islamist members of the opposition.  It is all very well to bemoan the huge humanitarian toll of the conflict, but that is what happens when neither side is capable of winning decisively. It is also what happens when the protagonists are armed, albeit covertly, by outsiders.  How long will it be before the armed forces of Member States are dragged into the conflict and body bags start to be flown home to Europe? How ethical was it, and is it, for the West to encourage other people to risk their lives to advance the West’s political agenda: that is, depriving Iran of an ally and Israel of an adversary? Was regime change really worth 70 000 lives?  The priority now must be to bring the bloodshed to an end. That can happen only when there are talks, without preconditions, on neutral territory.

 Madam President, dispute resolutions are self-evidently beneficial. Most disputes with retailers over goods and services would not be worth taking to court, which means, of course, that consumer complaints would not be considered and unscrupulous traders would take advantage of this. Of course, of the various forms of ADR, arbitration is undoubtedly the best, because at least it guarantees an early conclusion.  I have a greater problem with the underlying motive for these measures. It is not primarily to improve consumer rights, but to facilitate online cross-border trade in manufactured goods. This will undoubtedly affect adversely the manufacturing sectors of the higher wage economies of the West and the retail sectors of the West.  Nevertheless, they will benefit consumers buying products at home as well as abroad. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Violence and incitement to violence must of course be recognised as thoroughly despicable criminal acts. However, it appears that racism and xenophobia go beyond violence. Can you define these terms?

Mr President, so Mali is going to be on the agenda. All actions have consequences, some of them unintended as well as those that are planned. Those who are disposed to learn from past mistakes will recall that Britain’s war against the appalling regime in Afghanistan, and our ill-founded war against Iraq, resulted in the London bombings by third-generation Islamists from a large fifth column in Britain. The political leaders of France, Britain and the rest will not be thanked by the families of service personnel killed in this conflict or by the families of victims of retaliatory atrocities in Europe, which will be the direct result of this perceived incursion into Muslim territory. Of course the atrocities in Europe are facilitated by a large Muslim and significant Islamist population in the cities of Western Europe. Even those like the opportunists from whom we heard yesterday, who find it expedient to oppose this latest adventure, refuse to see the presence of fifth columns in Europe as the threat they undoubtedly are. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, of course British withdrawal from the EU and the recovery of exclusive use of our waters would solve the problem, but in the mean time any attempt to improve the common fisheries policy must be welcomed. Ending the practice of discarding dead and dying fish back into the sea is self-evidently right. The practice must be ended, whether it involves under-sized fish that have been caught accidentally, or less valuable fish that are discarded to make way for more valuable fish, so-called ‘high-grading’. Of course, enforcement with regard to the latter practice might be rather difficult.  Enabling Member States to enact their own conservation measures within a 12-nautical-mile zone is clearly desirable, but the Member State must be able to enforce that against other Member States. The rapporteur’s proposal that fishing concessions should cease to be freely transferable is particularly good. It would stop concessions from being bought and sold, and the concessions would remain the property of each Member State.  Successful policymaking is dependent on accurate supporting information. It has been estimated that stocks of 70% of the species caught in the EU have not been assessed accurately. The report particularly does not fully address the problem of incompatibility between the conservation of fish stocks and the survival of fishing industries. The only solution is for countries that have provided the bulk of the fish stock to be given priority in their own waters. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the year begins with unjustified optimism about growth prospects, but that recedes as the year’s realities begin to emerge. If you persuade countries to share a currency that is over-valued for some of them, if you import manufactured goods from countries of low wages and inhuman conditions and tolerate the transfer of production and investment to emergent economies, you will not get growth, you will get recession. If you import cheap labour from poorer countries, you will not get increased employment of our own nationals, you will increase unemployment. We have unsatisfied needs in our economies and unemployed people who could satisfy them. What is physically possible must be politically and financially possible or the political and financial systems are not fit for purpose. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, whilst I am not an enthusiast for the European Union, if we must have it, I prefer it to be more European rather than less European. These negotiations between the EU and Mercosur – and many other trading associations – show that the EU is not exclusively, or even mainly, focused on Europe. It is globalist. It has the ambitions that all cosmopolitans and neo-liberals have, of a borderless, undifferentiated world in which goods, services and people will move without let or hindrance.  The result of this is not only that eventually all distinctive peoples and therefore cultures will disappear, but that all wage rates and standards of living will approximate to the same level – which would not be the level that modern Europeans enjoy. The theory of international trade is that the world as a whole will be richer as the result of comparative advantage. However, it is not necessarily true that each country or continent, or each social group and sector, will also be richer. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, we have heard a lot about the priorities of the Irish Presidency, including improving economic growth and creating jobs. Of course neither is very likely at all with the euro being grossly overvalued for many of the southern European countries and the EU’s disastrous embrace of globalisation, neo-liberal economics and austerity measures.   Of course these and other priorities were not initiated by Ireland any more than Cyprus’s priorities were devised by that country. The Irish Foreign Minister let the cat out of the bag on 12 January: he said, “Today’s meeting helped to build on 18 months of Presidency preparations in close contact with the Commission”. It is all an elaborate delusion in which the rotating presidency provides a sort of demographic or democratic legitimacy to the programme of the unelected Commission. The President of the Council presides over a meeting of Member State representantives with an agenda provided for it from outside. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, I found the Cypriot President’s New Year’s Eve message refreshingly honest, as far as it went. He admitted that the policies implemented on a pan-European level had not succeeded in providing a solution to the crisis. He could, of course, have gone further and said that, if southern European countries in the eurozone were to revert to their own currencies, each being left to find its own value, those countries would enjoy export-led recoveries. He could have said that EU countries – individually or collectively – should protect their industries from imports from the so-called emergent economies. Earlier in December 2012, he did explain that the impasse on the Cyprus problem had been caused by Turkey, which used the Cyprus Presidency as an excuse. He might have added that the EU, for all its talk of solidarity, appears not to regard the Turkish occupation of Northern Cyprus and the desecration of its Christian places of worship as an impediment to talks on Turkey becoming a member.

Mr President, this report makes many valuable proposals about how companies ought to respond to restructuring. It is self-evidently right that workers should receive the maximum notice of redundancies and of course receive improved opportunities for re-employment. However, recital AC states, quite rightly, that different companies, sectors and countries have different needs, so I think Member State legislation would be more appropriate than EU legislation. There is one glaring flaw in the report. It treats the need for restructuring as though it were an autonomous need over which neither the EU nor Member States had any control. Recommendation 1 mentions the need for companies to be competitive. The question is with whom or what and why? The answer is twofold: relatively low labour costs within the EU and peripheral countries in Europe and much lower labour costs and appalling working conditions in the Third World and the so-called emergent economies. The unspoken cause of the need for restructuring is the process of globalisation which all the countries have signed up to. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, Mr Donskis is quite rightly concerned about selective justice under the guise of the rule of law, but of course only in new and transitional democracies.  In a number of EU Member States it is possible to be jailed for stating one’s views on immigration or expressing an opinion on academic subjects. Honest tyrannies that admit expressly to jailing people for being opponents are rare indeed. Nearly all tyrannies inside and outside the EU pretend that they are adhering to the rule of law but in fact they have passed laws which are tailor-made for their political opponents. France is probably the worst culprit in the EU, where the incautious choice of a word, detail or debate might lead to prosecution, as might the posing of an unfavoured analogy or comparison between events. Ms Le Pen is the latest victim of such a prosecution. Such countries are not so much democracies as gulags or prison camps. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, I am in principle opposed to all EU legislation but, other things being equal, I prefer that legislation to be in the form of a directive rather than the form of a regulation, which of course is self-enacting. The content of the 1996 Groundhandling Directive was bad enough because it resulted in an increase in short-term contracts and greater use of new staff. This has led to a fall in wage levels. The proposed regulation would bring about further liberalisation. This might look good from an accountant’s perspective, but the jobs involved include aircraft maintenance, cargo handling and dealing with passengers, encompassing security checks.  Is it really desirable to jeopardise safety, security and handling of valuables to transient staff without continuity of service? Liberalisation in this sphere, as in every other, is a recipe for oppressive working conditions, wage cuts and a lower standard of service. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, the report talks of the liberalisation of trade, investment and public tendering leading to mutual benefit. Trade liberalisation is, of course, a euphemism for globalisation, which actually leads to mutual detriment. The European Union will export its industrial technology to Central America, or possibly even relocate its manufacturing there, employing cheaper labour working in inferior conditions.  Cheap, duty-free goods will flow into the EU, jeopardising profits, wages and jobs in Member States. These are already in deep recession, with rising government debt. The report boasts of the expansion of the quantity and range of goods that will be tariff-free. The commitment to public tendering will allow multinationals based in the EU to swallow up public procurement contracts in Central America. This agreement, like globalisation – of which it is a part – is not for the benefit of ordinary people there or here, but in the interests of multinational corporations.

Mr President, we are used to hearing supporters of the EU project saying that we need more economic union, not less – not a sentiment I agree with. But I would say that the European Union is not European enough, and has become wedded to the political and economic ideology of globalism. The report refers with approval to the EU document of 2006 entitled ‘Global Europe’. This agreement, like many similar ones, removes virtually all tariff and non-tariff barriers after a transitional period. The EU is moving slowly but surely towards a world free of tariffs, a situation in which all living standards in the world will gravitate to the same level. The EU is sailing under a false flag. It is not a European Union, but a global union. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, human trafficking does not need to involve the crossing of national frontiers or even travel within a country. According to the UN it includes ‘recruiting people by deception for exploitation for prostitution’ – what we in Britain call ‘grooming’. British police and politicians were for years frightened to act for fear of being called racists. When my colleagues on Bradford Metropolitan Council in 2006 proposed a motion urging action against grooming, all the other councillors and parties voted against it. Those councillors included the present Conservative MP for Keighley, who is belatedly trying to exploit the issue. Whilst nationalists came to the rescue of British adolescents, all of the other parties walked by on the other side. When my former colleague, an MEP for the North-West, tried to draw public attention to the issue, the police and CPS tried unsuccessfully to prosecute him for incitement.

– Mr President, the real problem is all manufactured imports from, and all relocations to, China and other emerging economies. Indeed, the problem lies with ourselves, or rather with yourselves – addicted to neo-liberalism and the economic and political ideology of globalism. I will let you into a secret. China might have transformed itself into a capitalist economy and country but it is not neo-liberal. It competes with us with artificially depressed wage levels, which not only reduce costs, but also prevent the development of a market for imports from the West. Flagrant patent violations, 19th century working conditions, cheap state loans and subsidies and a grossly under-valued currency. In the meanwhile, they are stock-piling resources and Western currencies. If you think that global companies originating in the West are on our side, remember they are eagerly relocating where the costs are lowest and the conditions worst. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

– Mr President, there are several distinct questions apart from the obvious one of asking whether the EU should exist to spend any money at all. Is it spending money on the right things and the right recipients? Should it be the EU, as distinct from Member States, that spends that money? There are some items on which I would be happy for no money to be spent at all: the Year of the Citizen or the resettlement of economic migrants posing as asylum seekers. There are other targets of expenditure which are perfectly proper, such as the support for industry or agriculture, but in these cases the function ought to be exercised by Member States. How much should each country pay and how much should each receive? The EU does not advertise itself as an instrument for the redistribution of income and wealth as an end in itself, although it does precisely that, in the name of social cohesion. Fellow nationals of a Member State have a sufficiently shared identity to regard the pooling of resources and support as perfectly justifiable. However, the pooling of resources and support further afield is often a stimulus for resentment and even aggression – not exactly what the EU would like to produce, which is social cohesion. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

– Mr President, (inaudible)
 … austerity programmes do anything but aggravate a country’s problems of unemployment and debt. However, if people in various Member States are suffering because of those programmes, it seems a contradiction that a supranational body of which their country is a member should be asking for an increase in spending. It seems a contradiction, that is, if the country is a net contributor. Perhaps net recipients are less worried by that contradiction. Britain has always been a net contributor, which is why a previous prime minister negotiated the British rebate. Those who are now seeking to reduce our rebate by recalculating it want us to be even more of a net contributor. The UK might achieve a freeze on spending but still increase its net contribution. The British rebate is not money paid into a begging bowl held by a richer-than-average – and therefore undeserving – country; it represents the return of part of an excess of contributions over receipts.

 Mr President, ‘economic and monetary union is not an end in itself’, says the report. Quite right: it is an instrument to achieve political union. The report claims that it will achieve sustainable growth and a high level of employment, but it admits that unemployment in the 27 has risen by 50% from 2008 to 2012. In those countries for which the euro is overvalued, mass unemployment and negative growth are directly attributable to euro area membership. If they were to leave the zone they would experience export-led growth and a fall in their unemployment. The euro-led recession in the South has not left the North unscathed. Its exports to the South have been reduced severely. More control and austerity measures will not reduce debt. They will reduce employment and profits, which will cut government revenue. This will lead to more debt rather than less debt. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI
). 
 – Mr President, this is an unusual example of the EU recognising a real problem which does need to be addressed internationally, though not necessarily by the EU. The problem with passing a law which prohibits people from purchasing something is that, the longer the process takes, the greater the chance of the purchasers – in this case would-be terrorists – stockpiling the items in advance of the ban. I can remember this proposal first being mentioned in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs at least a year ago, possibly longer than that, and of course we do not know when the legislation is likely to be passed and come into effect. I think it would have been preferable, initially, to agree internationally to enlist the support of the industry in adopting a voluntary code of practice, and then to encourage all countries, including Member States, to pass legislation without delay. In the UK, for example, it is possible in certain circumstances to pass a law within 24 hours. The procedure in the European Parliament is so long and detailed that it is likely that would-be offenders will already have stockpiled before the legislation is enforced. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, the report is not so much a piece of economic reasoning as a tautology. More integration is seen as necessary to achieve more integration. Coordination is not an answer to unemployment but is seen as an end in itself; it is not so much a cure for unemployment as displacement activity for those without a cure. The answer to the problems of the South is not austerity, which produces only more unemployment. It does not even do what is written on the tin, which is reducing debt. Most of the countries of Europe need reflation without inflation. We must remember that what is physically possible must be financially possible, or there is something wrong with the financial system. We need to see an abandonment of the euro experiment and southern countries released to enjoy export-led booms. We must reject globalism, protect and recreate our industries and reject the coded references in this report to wage cuts and worsened economic conditions. We must not drive down our wages and conditions... (The President cut off the speaker) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI
).  
– Madam President, the Commission’s priorities are directed towards greater integration as an end in itself and not towards measures that will solve the real economic problems facing the populations of Europe. The greatest of course is the recession, with its unemployment and under-employment, squeezed incomes and reduced benefits. Indeed, the austerity programme is calculated to produce unemployment and not to combat it. One policy area mentioned is genuine economic and monetary union: the euro, with its common external value that is hideously overvalued for the countries of the South, and which is aggravating and perpetuating the recession for them. Another Commission priority is said to be to use EU resources to improve competitiveness. Well, countries with overvalued currencies cannot compete even with other countries in their region. The EU’s embrace of globalism means that European manufacturers have to compete with emergent economies with pirated designs, workers on artificially depressed wages and slave-labour conditions.

 Madam President, yet again we vote on a report full of insane sabre-rattling against undemocratic Russia but, as the nominations deadline for the EU elections approached for Italy yesterday, the police force of your occupation government arrested dozens of Forza Nuova activists, imprisoning them without any justification ...

 Mr President, the plight of minorities and refugees in Syria is indeed terrible, but who have they fled from? I went to Syria twice last summer and wrote the letter that the Syrian Government sent to help sway the UK Parliament’s vote against a bombing campaign that would have killed and displaced even more innocent victims. While I was there, I met Christian, Alawite and Muslim refugees. I can tell you that huge numbers of them have been forced from their homes by the same Jihadi rebel terrorists that the EU has done so much to help. If you really care about the people of Syria, you should insist that the CIA and Zionist warmongers stop arming their Jihadi mercenaries and you should impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia and Qatar for funding the invasion of Syria by the thousands of Islamist cut-throats from whom so many Shia, Christians, Alawites and moderate Sunnis have had to flee for their lives. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, we all agree that the Communist regime in North Korea is an undemocratic shame. What are we to make of a regime that jails its opponents on trumped-up charges and keeps them in prison, even when the political motivation for it is tape-recorded and exposed? What are we to make of a regime that claims to hold free and fair elections, but then arrests its opponents to stop them collecting and delivering the 300[nbsp ]000 signatures they need to stand? If it happened in North Korea you would rightly condemn it, but the victims in my first example are Greeks, and in my second, Italians. Because the systematic police repression of Forza Nuova activists has happened there in the last 24 hours. So stop whining about North Korea, as it is totally hypocritical unless you also stand for the right of European electors to choose Golden Dawn or Forza Nuova if they so wish. You have no power at all to change North Korea, vile though the Communist regime there undoubtedly is, but you could order your backyard occupation puppet regimes to restore democracy in Greece and Italy this afternoon. People in glass houses should not throw stones. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, what is the main aspect of EU foreign policy? To help the USA meddle around the world in places that have nothing to do with us – Iraq, Serbia, Libya, Afghanistan, Syria. You have acted as cheerleaders for aggressive neo-con interference which has benefited only radical Islamists but has destroyed societies, while costing British taxpayers billions of pounds. Now the target is Russia.  Members know full well that the so-called Ukrainian revolution was manufactured with everything from the agitprop to the snipers provided from the USA and the EU. We all know the root of the tough Russian reaction is aggressive NATO expansionism, first into Poland, next into Ukraine. Yet you persist in irresponsible sabre-rattling in someone else’s natural sphere of influence. It is said that in 1914, Europe sleepwalked into war. This time you are heading there with eyes wide open. The basic choice is war or peace. You seem hell-bent on war, so remember: whatever excuses you manufacture, plotting an aggressive war is itself a crime. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr[nbsp ]President, when the godfather of the European Union, Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, published the plan for a united Europe and the ethnocide of the peoples of Europe, the encouragement of mass non-white immigration was central to the plot. Since then, an unholy alliance of leftists, capitalists and Zionist supremacists has schemed to promote immigration and miscegenation with the deliberate aim of breeding us out of existence in our homelands. As indigenous resistance to this human genetic-modification industry grows, the criminal elite seeks new ways to camouflage their project. First, their immigrant pawns were temporary guest workers; then it was a multiracial experiment; then they were refugees, and then the answer to a shrinking population. Different excuses, different lies – and asylum is just another one. But the real aim stays the same: the biggest genocide in human history, the final solution to the Christian European problem. This crime demands a new set of Nuremberg trials, and you people will be in the dock. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nick Griffin  (NI

I have a constructive suggestion to help those poor asylum seekers from Africa. Yes, make it clear they cannot come here so they do not try to cross the sea and drown in huge numbers. The best way for them is to get the banks off the backs of their countries so that they can live in peace in their countries and we Europeans can live in peace in ours. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Madam President, unlike the others in this debate I have gone twice to war-torn Syria to see at first hand what is really going on there. So I can tell you that the majority of the refugees do not want or need to come to Europe. They just want the West to leave the Syrian army to finish off the Islamist terror gangs from whom the Christians, Alawites and moderate Sunnis fled for their lives. Then they will be able to go home.  The Wahhabi minority should go to their Gulf State sponsors, where they too would be at home. I can also tell you that, having used the CIA to help the rebels destroy so much of Syria, American and French corporations are already in contact with Damascus to negotiate multi-billion-dollar reconstruction contracts. While the EU and Mr Farage unite to import a wave of violently Islamist asylum seekers to already poor and stressed parts of our constituencies, American and French companies are chasing profits for big business, as usual.

Madam President, Prime Minister, 2014 is supposed to be the year of democracy in Europe, but what kind of democracy tears up its own constitution, bans demonstrations to prove the people are happy, sends machine gun-toting storm-troopers to arrest democratically elected MPs and imprisons opponents without trial when they cannot disprove hearsay allegations made against them by police informers? Totalitarians like you always justify such attacks on freedom with propaganda lies about criminal association but, Mr Samaras, your bankers’ occupation government – now busy helping your masters loot Greece – are the real criminals. You are the heir of the communists who refused to fight when your country was invaded by Mussolini, when Metaxas said ‘no’ and fought foreign occupation and exploitation – which is of course the real crime of its modern political descendants, Golden Dawn. Nick Griffin  (NI

Mr President, there is all this fuss over the activities of an unelected pressure group which was warned in advance not to invade the waters of a sovereign nation and break legitimate laws. No Russian citizen has ever voted for Greenpeace. They have no democratic mandate whatsoever. So imagine how much bigger the fuss would be if Russia launched a totally illegal assault on a legitimately-elected political party. Imagine if the Russian Government were to use the excuse of waves of lies from a controlled mass media to arrest the leaders of the opposition. Imagine if President Putin were to tear up the constitutional rights of democratically-elected parliamentarians and spit in the face of a growing body of opinion of up to 20 % of voters. We would never hear the end of it, and rightly so. But when these things happen in Greece, you hypocrites either say nothing or actively applaud the repression. No one ever voted for Greenpeace, but half a million Greek voters have been disenfranchised by the attempted murder of Golden Dawn at the behest of EU bureaucrats, German bankers and Zionist gangsters. This looters’ coup against the Greek people by the puppets of the privatisation criminals is a thousand times more important than this artificial hysteria on behalf of an unelected, unrepresentative group of watermelon-green cranks.

Mr President, having spoken in Damascus with many relatives of victims of the Islamist war on Syria, I hope that we all welcome the Russian proposal to put chemical weapons beyond use, without an escalation of the conflict. We should do everything possible to help this diplomacy to succeed, because if it falters Obama, Hollande, Cameron and the other neo-con puppets will drag us into a conflict that is certain to spiral out of control. Obama claims there will be no boots on the ground. That is a lie, because if the US bombs Syria into the clutches of al-Qa’ida, then Syria’s chemical weapon stockpile will end up in the hands not of the United Nations decommissioning teams, but of the heirs of Osama bin Laden. American, British and European troops will then have to be sent in to try and secure those weapons, and our soldiers will die in Syria in order to stop children dying in Islamist poison gas attacks, not just in Damascus but in Paris, London and New York. That is why we should turn the Russian peace proposal into reality. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, I recently spent four days in Damascus, a city that is striking for its normality and religious tolerance. Contrary to the propaganda about repression, Sunni mosques are open and some women wear clothing which shows the Salafist sympathies of their husbands. Others wear mini-skirts. It is a secular society much like ours. I also met captured free-Syria army rebels not only from North Africa and Central Asia, but also from France and Spain. They spoke freely about their aim, once they were done in Syria, to bring their bloody jihad to Europe – to London, Paris, Madrid, Stockholm and Manchester. At least 600 EU-born Islamists are fighting with the rebels. If you send arms to Syria, they will go to men who will bring them back here and turn them against us. If you arm the rebels, you will not just help these cut-throats destroy the last tolerant secular state in the Middle East, you will also bring Wahabi terror to our streets. Stop and think before you plunge your hands in so much innocent blood. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, tonight several hundred more British old-age pensioners will freeze to death. Why? Because of fuel poverty. Because carbon profiteers, wind farm wide-boys and left-wing broadcast media like the BBC have conned and bullied and bribed MPs and MEPs into believing – or pretending to believe – that man-made global warming is going to destroy the world. This modern version of an ancient religious fantasy is being used as an excuse for the biggest corporate scam in human history. Carbon taxes make fortunes for the super rich while old Mrs Smith shivers to death. Tonight, while out-of-touch politicians waffle on about unattainable targets that will de-industrialise Europe, real people are dying one by one. There is a legal term for what the political elite are doing here: corporate manslaughter. Nick Griffin  (NI

Madam President, when we discuss violence against women, there is a desperate attempt to avoid mentioning the giant green elephant in our midst: Islam. Islam’s inherent devaluing of women and hostility to unbelievers combine to make it the greatest threat to millions of women and girls in many parts of the EU. In Britain, the crime of on-street grooming for sex, drugs and prostitution is directed against thousands of girls as young as 10. Many of the victims are beaten, threatened and gang-raped. While the majority community produces many perpetrators of internet paedophilia and one-on-one sex crimes, paedophile gang rape is a crime in which the perpetrators are overwhelmingly Muslim, while their innocent victims are invariably from other communities.  In my constituency, 14-year-old Charlene Downes was groomed, raped and murdered. Her body has never been found. The case against two Muslim men collapsed on a technicality; however, while the police say that they are not looking for anyone else, they continue to ignore evidence of jury rigging and refuse to seek a retrial. Charlene’s mother and grandmother are bravely and actively campaigning for justice. Shockingly, this has resulted in both of them being repeatedly threatened with arrest for involvement in entirely peaceful protests. The problem of officialdom turning a blind eye to the inconvenient truth about Islam and sexual violence is thus endemic. I urge those here who are concerned about this issue to face the politically-incorrect truth, because denial will not make the problem go away. Justice for Charlene Downs!

 Madam President, while the people on that side of the House are denying the facts, thousands more young girls will suffer as a direct consequence of your denial. Of course Islam is directly involved. When you have a religion which says that a woman’s rights in court are half those of a man, when you have a religion which says that a woman who is raped can be stoned to death for adultery unless she can produce four male witnesses to prove she is innocent, then of course that creates a mentality within that community which is fundamentally anti-women.  It started with Muhammad, who raped a captive – a Jewish captive – whose husband he just had murdered. He started that, and he is regarded by Muslims as the perfect man. His example colours what Muslims do. Many Muslims do not, but within their community this is real problem. You need to recognise that fact and address it, not run away from it. Nick Griffin  (NI

You say your heart beats strongly for women raped in India – mine does, too – but does your heart not also beat for the thousands of young girls gang-raped in Britain over the last few years, or are you simply left in ignorance because the facts are concealed by the controlled liberal media?

 Mr President, this is a depressing but predictable report: the persecution of hundreds of thousands of Christians, one and a half million refugees, broken infrastructure, murderous sectarian militias, daily bombings and shootings, child prostitution, honour killings, female genital mutilation and brutal Islamist repression of women. It is good to see the EU, albeit indirectly, admit that Western meddling in Iraq has led to disaster. It would be even better if the cheerleaders for the illegal war of 2003 that created this shambles were to apologise and learn from their terrible error. It is utterly hypocritical for members of the globalist elite to shed crocodile tears over the collapse of Iraq while at the same time striving to replicate it in Syria. Just as in Iraq, so the fall of Assad would lead not to Syria becoming a replica Switzerland, but to its collapse into bloody anarchy and the triumph of Wahhabi fundamentalism. This meddling has already helped kill hundreds of thousands in Iraq. It is time for a little humility and to leave Syria to the Syrians. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, I was an international observer in the Ukraine elections. I had unrestricted access in Kiev to polling stations, election officials and party activists.  I have seen corrupt elections where gangs of thugs sponsored by the prime minister attack opposition activists; where council workers are threatened with losing their jobs if they vote the wrong way on ballot papers that carry traceable serial marks; where two million voters do not even exist but still vote by post; where, at the close of polls, unsealed ballot boxes are taken to central counting places by unsupervised officials; where the election officials are appointed by the local ruling party. But all these assaults on democracy go on routinely in the United Kingdom. In Ukraine I saw a robust and well-designed system, ensuring elections which, while not perfect, are much freer and fairer than those in Britain. EU hypocrites do not have any right to criticise Ukrainian elections. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Madam President, the fracking debate is full of deceit by those who stand to profit from shale gas or who see it as a weapon in neocon hostility to Russia. We are told that most fracking in the USA is by small and medium-sized enterprises, yet few real SMEs have the capital or technology for fracking. What looked like SMEs are in fact limited liability fronts for giant corporations. They exist solely to spare the parent companies the huge cost of eventual clean-up operations, which will therefore fall on the taxpayers. The game is simple: loot, pollute and scoot. Claims of massive job creation are lies too. The Public Policy Institute of New York State claimed that 500 new wells per year would produce 62 000 jobs, yet a review by Food and Water Watch showed that the true figure is fewer than 7 000, scarcely one tenth of the promised boom. In every part of the USA where shale gas is exploited, house prices crash by 25%, with environmental devastation from hundreds of platforms and huge, poisoned slurry ponds. The longer-term threat to water supplies could be even more costly. Gas fracking is short-termist, boom-and-bust exploitation. Yes, it produces energy, but so would burning all our forests. It makes no sense except to lobbyists and politicians in the pay of the companies doing the looting. The answer to the energy crunch is not short-term fracking but long-term, safe, sustainable nuclear power and electricity- and hydrogen-fuelled transport systems. That is the energy economy of the future. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Madam President, the voluntary system proposed would have very little effect on Britain because the British system is already very effective. But I have heard from a number of constituents who are concerned that anything involved in the transportation of live animals can, in the end, be used to facilitate the transport of animals for slaughter over a long distance. This is something that is clearly unnecessary in an era of modern refrigeration, and which needs to be phased out. On the question of labelling, the great concern of everyone concerned with animal welfare is that all meat originating from animals suffering ritual slaughter should be labelled: consumers have the right to know and to reject it.

– Mr President, in May, President Barroso bragged of the EU and its Member States throwing EUR 1.2 billion a year down the Afghan drain. But EUR 1.2 billion is only a fraction of the true cost. Britain’s contribution alone to the Afghan farce, according to the British Ministry of Defence, is already over GBP 18 billion, plus GBP 3 billion in aid, plus GBP 4 billion in equipment that is to be left behind, plus GBP 5 billion that will be screwed out of the British taxpayer to run Afghanistan for a further 30 years. Most importantly, 417 British dead are the highest price of all and the most obscene, because it is a war that has nothing to do with Britain. We should bring our troops home at once and put the neo-con crooks who sent them there on trial as war criminals. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, no decent human being can feel anything other than deep sympathy for young men who leave their families and risk death in overcrowded boats in order to reach a new land of milk and honey. But why do they do it? Who is responsible for luring these poor people into so much disappointment and even danger? The politicians. Because every time the political class insists on giving one batch of immigrants the houses, taxes and jobs that belong to the long-suffering natives in Manchester or Malmö or Brussels or Birmingham, you incite another boatload to risk their lives to get to the promised land and be given other peoples’ milk and honey. Three simple rules would end the immigration crisis. One: no jobs for immigrants while our own people face mass unemployment. Two: if a greedy boss is caught employing illegal labour, the business should be confiscated. Three: if you have not paid in, you do not get a house or a penny in benefits. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, it would be easy to mock this report. Indeed, it is being laughed at by millions of British voters reading their papers this morning. Coming at a time when the euro disaster is breaking nations and driving desperate people to suicide, this staggering exercise in politically correct sloganising could – had it been on the agenda at the start of this month – easily have been mistaken for an April Fool’s joke. But in truth, this attempt to institutionalise discrimination and contempt against half the population of Europe is not a laughing matter. Men and women are conceived to complement each other for the common good. This proposal is an attempt to sow discord between the sexes, break family values and export EU Frankfurt School poison worldwide, using the excuse of climate change. Such incitement to gender-based contempt, division and hate is not a victimless crime. Hundreds of thousands of men are denied access to their children after bitter divorces. Thousands of children are snatched by the state because the crucial importance of fathers and loving, united families is denied and undermined by militant feminism of the sort that underlies this report. Meanwhile, there are real problems out there hurting real people. Voters expect us at least to try to solve them, not to waste our time and their money on sexist anti-male, anti-family gibberish. Ladies and gentlemen, please, let us drop this empty, bigoted sloganising and work together to deal with real problems. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, be careful what you wish for because you may get it. This old saying is very true about reducing our use of hydrocarbons. By 2050 we will have a low-carbon economy for the simple reason that we will largely have run out of carbon. All the increases in non-conventional hydrocarbons, including from environmentally catastrophic shale oil and gas fracking, are only just about keeping up with the worldwide decline of conventional oil production. The long emergency of peak oil has begun. Those who think we can deal with it by building wind farms and eating nut cutlets may mean well, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. The biggest threat is to food production. In agriculture, before the age of oil, for every calorie of energy invested by man, horse or ox, the average return was one-and-a-half calories. On that small surplus our ancestors built their cathedrals, painted their Rembrandts and wrote their Rights of Man. Oil-based agriculture uses far fewer people to produce far more food. Its ratio is twenty-to-one. That is an input of 20 calories of oil energy for machinery, fertilisers and pesticides for every calorie of food produced. Today’s globalised world is a house of cards, built on the suicidally-unsustainable use of finite fossilised sunlight. This is the real carbon crisis which we need to address. If we continue to fail to do so, today’s children will look back in despair at all the time and energy that our generation wasted trying to kill the wrong pig. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, as an observer in Moscow at the Duma elections, I witnessed a robust system which is far more democratic than the fraud-ridden shambles in Britain. If observers come to elections in London this May, they will find hundreds of thousands of non-existent ghosts voting by post without any kind of ID check. They will see flimsy cardboard ballot boxes with voting papers falling out of gaps at the bottom, mainly under the control of appointees of Baroness Ashton’s Labour Party. At least the Russians have elections. Baroness Ashton became one of the most powerful figures in post-democratic Europe without a single vote. And who elected the technocrats now asset-stripping occupied Greece and Italy? We all know the real reasons for the attacks on Putin. George Soros and his banker friends want to privatise and loot Russia just like they are looting the West. So forget about the specks of dust in Mr Putin’s eye and remove the giant planks of electoral fraud and elite greed from the European Union’s. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, I can start by saying that Mr Bové’s report is so comprehensive that it is difficult to add anything to the excellent job he has done. But I will point out that, with agricultural wages in Morocco at an average of just five euros a day, trade liberalisation can only add to the desperate plight of farmers in Greece, Sicily and Spain. It is madness for the EU to give preferential treatment to big business concerns exploiting the Maghreb while its banking elite force murderous poverty on hard-working people in our own back yard. Since not even the most crazed global-warmist still claims that we will soon be growing olives in Lancashire or oranges in Kent, it follows that we will have to continue to import such produce. Let us do so from our hard-pressed fellow Europeans in Greece, Italy, France, Portugal and Spain. Leave the farmland of Morocco to support farming families in Morocco, rather than helping international agri-business swallow it all up and spit the human wreckage out at our shores as destitute and angry Islamist refugees.

 Mr President, on weapons of mass destruction, one should remember how politicians and media liars queued up to demand action against Iraq over WMDs. That propaganda lie justified sanctions and an illegal war. MEPs who voted for sanctions against Iraq over those non-existent WMDs might have meant well, but they helped to murder hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children, who died through lack of food and medicine. Now it is nuclear weapons of mass destruction. It is a new target, Iran, but the main victims will be the same – children – because a successful oil and banking embargo would make it impossible for Iran to buy enough food and medicine for its population. If the EU votes for sanctions it exposes itself as bankrupt – not merely financially, but morally too. If Saudi Wahabis and Zionist neo-Cons want war with Iran, that is their business, but it is not ours, and we should stay out of it.

When the Iranians look at what happened to Libya – which did not have effective weapons – you really cannot blame them for wanting to defend themselves, if that is what they are doing.

 Mr President, in discussing Durban, the most obvious question is whether an agreement last year to reach an agreement in three years’ time to do something in eight years’ time is really an agreement at all. Likewise, one has to ask whether the agreement to create a green climate fund and transfer USD 1 billion a year from hard-pressed taxpayers in countries like Britain to corrupt third world oligarchies reflects a serious threat of global communism or a happily unattainable fantasy. Given the way in which EU Commissioners are forcing economically suicidal spending cuts on the protectorates of Greece and Italy – a move likely to spark a chain-reaction implosion of the entire financial system – the fantasy answer is fortunately the more realistic. But the most significant thing about Durban is what was not discussed: climate science. This is no surprise, as it is now crystal clear that the so-called scientific consensus on man-made global warming simply does not exist. It is not just a matter of the thousands of independent scientists who dispute the whole theory: even the warmists themselves now admit that the computer models on which the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) cult is based are simplistic and flawed. The more they learn about feedback mechanisms and the complexity of real climate, the more they realise they do not know. To crucify our taxpayers and de-industrialise our economies in pursuit of the one-world government madness of the United Nations is therefore crazy. Hence the failure of 10 000 well-meaning tax-eaters to agree anything serious in Durban is to be warmly applauded. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, when there is a stench of death and decay in your house, there is no point complaining about the neighbour’s drains or arguing about which air freshener to try next. The first thing to do is to admit that the real problem is the rotting corpse of the dead elephant in the living room. It is absurd to speak of economic governance while ignoring the root cause of the debt crisis that is dragging Europe, and indeed the world, down to economic disaster. The thing that is rotten is the fiat money banking system. A system that allows the banks to create credit out of nothing and lend it into circulation as interest-bearing debt; a system that makes bankers the masters of the universe, instead of the servants of productive industry. A system that leads to poverty, division and war. The first step to long-term economic stability is to put an end to the international bankers’ swindle and restore the power to create credit to sovereign national governments. This is the only way out of the crisis; the way to prosperity and peace. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Madam President, my constituency is suffering a hidden epidemic of sexual grooming so I appreciate the efforts of all those involved in producing this report. The grassroots campaigners for the protection of children tell me that the report misses the most important target. To concentrate on online pornography while relegating real-life child sexual abuse to a page 33 annex is to worry about a speck in one eye while ignoring a splintered plank in another. Real-life abuse is described in the report as ‘offline grooming’. Such terminology is an insult to the victims and their families. It is not offline: it is on our streets. It is not a matter of images: it is a matter of real-life degradation, gang rape, and even murder. But because a disproportionately large number of street groomers are Muslims, politically-correct censorship prevents the issue from being properly discussed. Because of this deliberate downplaying of the problem, on-street grooming is not even a specific offence in many countries. As a result, the crime remains statistically virtually invisible. This undermines attempts to secure justice for the victims, effective responses from the authorities, and proper penalties for the perpetrators. In my own constituency, the family of Charlene Downs still waits for justice following the botched prosecution of those arrested over the grooming, rape and murder of their little girl in 2003. Despite their belief that 60 other girls had been groomed by the same gang, and that Charlene’s body was disposed of in kebabs, the police regarded their report as too sensitive to publish. The consequences of such cowardice became clear four years later when 15-year-old Paige Chivers went missing, believed murdered, at the hands of the same gang. Of course, not all police officers are politically correct cowards, any more than all Muslims are groomers. The vast majority are as sickened by these things as we are, but the playing down of the problem in reports like this aids the criminal minority and leaves new victims at risk. The more serious crimes should get the attention. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, for some years now climate realists like me have struggled to understand what lies behind the man-made global warming hoax which will be further exploited at Rio+20. Various theories have been put forward. Post-1989, it gave the far left a new stick with which to beat the West. Maurice Strong and the United Nations saw it as a way of promoting one-world government. It has handed carbon traders and wind factory profiteers a taxpayer-funded blank cheque. But none of the above explains the hitherto puzzling role of big oil and neo-con foundations in funding the environmentalist protest groups which have led the climate-change and anti-nuclear propaganda offensives. Now, however, their real agenda is coming to light. Phoney green hysteria has blocked the potential for nuclear and coal electricity to power our civilisation in the post-peak oil world. This gap allows those who will profit from gas fracking to say that we have no choice but to exploit this environmentally disastrous energy source. Of course we have no choice, because their useful idiot Greens have denied us the other alternatives. So now we face a fracking gold rush in, among other targets, Lancashire, Wales, southern England, France and Poland, where George Soros has just won an almost exclusive licence to loot and pollute almost the entire country. The neo-cons and globalists are also excited about the potential of fracked gas to advance their geopolitical agenda of reducing the influence of Russia and destabilising the Arab world. Climate change never was about drowning polar bears. It was always about big business profit and elite power. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, EUR 1 billion every year: that is the amount of taxpayers’ money that the Commission and Member States give to the Palestinian Authority. EUR 1 billion a year to a corrupt regime that does very little for its own people, while ordinary voters in our countries are crushed by rising taxes and inflation. It is unreal. Worse than that, EU policy is based on the false concept that a two-state solution is workable. It might have been once, but it is too late now. The Palestinians are geographically dispersed: over two million live east of the 1947 armistice lines, a million in Gaza, and about a million in Israel. In the Occupied Territories, the illegal Zionist settlement programme has sliced their land into disjointed parcels. Even if all the territories conquered in 1967 were included, Palestine would still be only 22% of the territory of the current Greater Israel. It would be an economic basket case, forever reliant on foreign aid handouts. The two-state solution sounds pretty, but it is simply not realistic. Yet again, the EU is throwing money away on a policy doomed to failure. We must accept that we cannot solve every problem in the world. We should turn our attention and money to solving our own. Let us face it: thanks to the euro disaster, this place is not going to run out of problems. EU meddling in the Holy Land is not only stealing money from overtaxed British families; combined with even more massive US aid for Israel it encourages both sides to refuse to get serious about sorting out their own differences. None of it helps real people. It is a counterproductive waste of EUR 1 billion a year. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, my voters and my party are overwhelmingly sceptical about GM crops. Like the majority of voters in every country of Europe, we reject technology imposed for the profit of giant multinationals without safeguards or consent. We reject technology that will replace sustainable local family farming with short-sighted international agri-business. Where we part company with the Commission is over the way in which the Europhiles, as always, are seeking to exploit such genuine concerns and real problems by pushing for federal European solutions. This report, giving back a little power to nation-states, is a welcome exception. But, in the long term, if the people of Britain want to secure the freedom to reject Frankenstein foods, they will not get it by bowing to the European project. They will only get it when they reject the rule of the corrupt Westminster political elite and their big business puppet masters, because it is that out-of-touch greedy elite which is forcing upon us both Frankenstein foods and the Frankenstein monster that is the European Union. Our voters demand the freedom to reject both in free and fair referendums. The Westminster elite is not only allowing reckless multinationals to genetically modify our food, their mass immigration policy is also genetically modifying the entire British population, just as your utopian multiculturalism is destroying traditional identities all over Europe. This is why, both in Westminster and Strasbourg, we the people have to get rid of the elites before the elites get rid of us. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, first it was cucumbers, yesterday it was bean sprouts. Today, it is not bean sprouts. The truth is that the experts just do not know, but each time such allegations are made, they destroy livelihoods in countries’ economies. What we do know is that there is something very strange about this outbreak. There is an unnatural combination of strains and DNA in the virus. It is affecting unusual groups of people in a way not normally associated with E coli outbreaks. It has already struck far more people and in far more places than a normal outbreak and, unlike in normal outbreaks, it has not been rapidly traced to one or two food suppliers. Given all these inexplicable factors and the fact that various countries – including Britain, the USA, Iraq and Israel – have, in the past, been reported as experimenting with genetically manipulated E coli as a biological weapon, should there not be an urgent inquiry into the possibility that this outbreak is, in fact, an instance of, and perhaps a test run for, biological terrorism?

 I voted to oppose the removal of the Parliamentary immunity of Bruno Gollnisch because: 1. Free speech is a core value of our society and the cornerstone of our democracy. It should not be curtailed by political opponents. The comments attributed to Mr Gollnisch were not incitements to violence and were not abusive or insulting. The comments were about the intolerance of Islamist regimes towards Unbelievers. 2. No debate was allowed before the votes on this issue, which affect the fundamental rights of an MEP. 3. The proposal to lift Bruno Gollnisch’s immunity (and the politically motivated decision to lift it) were inconsistent with the proposal to allow the German MEP Elmar Brok to retain his immunity from prosecution for an (alleged) greed offence of tax evasion. It is clear that the prosecution is a vexatious one, by a private organisation, designed to deprive Mr Gollnisch of his elected position and his good name. It is equally clear that, in the increasingly intolerant atmosphere of Political Correctness that is permeating the Parliament, some MEPs are more equal than others. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, the explosion at Chernobyl was a disaster, but let us keep it in perspective: 64 people were killed by Chernobyl radiation over 23 years, and it caused an unknown proportion of 6000 cases of thyroid cancer. These are tragic figures but they pale into insignificance compared to the death toll on our roads. Yet, while no one is using road traffic accidents to campaign to ban the motor car, a small army of leftists is using Chernobyl to push for an end to nuclear power. I do not doubt that they mean well but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. The same people meant well when they helped to create the biofuels rush, pushing the price of food beyond the reach of the world’s poor. Tonight millions of children will go to bed slowly dying of hunger because people on that side of the House meant well: that is what the fuzzy ideals of the Utopian left do in the real world. The impact of a nuclear ban would be even worse because the alternative to nuclear power is not wind farms and solar panels. In our energy-scarce, post-peak oil world, the alternative to reactors is mass starvation. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, as is so common here, this debate has little connection to reality and none whatsoever to democracy. Most here talk as though Iceland being sucked into the Euro black hole is a done deal. But that is not the message coming from Icelanders. Current opinion polls show that those who wish to keep their independence outnumber the Euro-Quislings and Europhiles nearly two to one. Seventy-five percent of Icelanders wisely do not trust the EU. The only Icelandic party in favour of membership has slumped from 30% to 18% in the polls. It is the same all over Europe. While the political elite move to ever closer union and federal empire, the people want freedom and independence. Such mismatches are the seedbed of revolution. Congratulate yourselves on accession progress all you like, but the coming financial meltdown in the countries being crushed in your Euro straightjacket will be costly to us all, but fatal to your Utopia. Iceland, and the nations now stuck in your raspberry Reich, will be free at last. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, as I hear discussions on ways to screw more money out of the little people in the name of climate change, I am struck by two things. The first is how no one talks about global warming anymore. Even the most out-of-touch MEPs have clearly realised that exposés of fraudulent pseudoscience and record cold winters across the globe have made the public, rightly, very sceptical about all the deceitful propaganda about drowning polar bears. The second is the car park beneath us – Porches, Mercedes, BMWs, SUVs, a showroom of gas-guzzling luxury from the people who tut-tut in disapproval at many white vans and plot to make working lives even harder with speed limiters and financial penalties, all for a dogma based on discredited statistics pedalled by a clique of bought and paid-for academics, funded and hyped by super-rich vested interests in the green industrial complex – Al Gore, Prince Charles, Shell and Goldman Sachs – all of whom stand to steal a fortune from the taxes harvested through wind factory subsidies and carbon trading. While I appreciate the efforts of some MEPs to blunt the worst excesses of this CO2
 hysteria, the plain truth is that anyone who even gives credence to the threadbare hoax of man-made global warming is a collaborator with the deadliest scam in history. Yes, deadly, because it is not only robbing ordinary people and de-industrialising the West; it is also right now starving to death hundreds of thousands of the world’s poorest children as food crops are replaced by taxpayer-subsidised biofuels. But it is boosting profits for Monsanto and giving MEPs all expenses paid trips to palm oil plantations in Malaysia, so that is all right is it not? No, it is not, particularly as it is diverting attention from the real crisis – not that we are releasing carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, but that we are beginning to run low on the oil which powers our civilisation. Every day wasted talking about limiting emissions of nature’s most important fertiliser is a day lost in the struggle to sustain more and more people on less and less energy. If it was not such a tragedy, it would be a farce. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, I do not know if the House noticed, but yesterday was also the record snowfall in Korea for 100 years, so it is not just a few places. Just as it was two years ago in Copenhagen, when the climate change conference was there, it was the coldest at the climate change conference in Cancún that it had been for decades. Secondly, there is no evidence whatsoever of meltwater from the Arctic impeding the Gulf Stream. There has been no change in that whatsoever. Thirdly, your arguments would be more effective if the climate change computer models had foreseen this a couple of years ago. They did not. A couple of years ago, we were told that our children would not know what snow was. What an absolute nonsense this has been. Finally, as for the statistics showing a global warming trend, the key factor everyone is ignoring here is that 65% of the world’s weather stations are within 10 metres of an artificial heat source. They are virtually all in cities. The collapse of the Soviet Union meant that most of the weather stations in naturally cold areas were closed down. That is what has skewed the statistics, which are fundamentally bogus because people, boosted by the United Nations, set about finding man-made global warming in order to impose the solutions they wanted.

 Madam President, a young woman in my constituency has this morning, as every weekday morning at this time, just returned home from walking her two young children to school. Jenny used to drive them there but she can no longer afford to put petrol in the car for anything other than her twice-weekly trip to the cheapest supermarket in her part of Manchester. This morning, as every morning, Jenny is hungry because she has a choice for breakfast: either she eats or her two little girls eat. There is not enough bread and jam for all of them. Meanwhile, here on planet EU, MEPs discuss tweaks to a financial instrument that involves the spending of EUR 1.1 billion of taxpayers’ money on promoting democracy and human rights, mainly in the third world. Most of those tweaks further reduce the oversight the nation states have, as the Commission burns its way through vast amounts of British taxpayers’ money. What a waste and what hypocrisy to bang on about women’s rights in Africa when thousands of Jennies cannot even feed their kids properly. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Madam President, this report demolishes the lies of the British political class about the Afghan War. I do not know the names of any of the innocent Afghan victims of this wicked war, but I do know that it has nothing to do with British interests. And I know the names of the 18 brave young men from my constituency who paid with their lives for this madness in the last year alone. Corporal Simon Hornby, Liverpool; Warrant Officer David Markland, Lancashire; Kingsman Sean Dawson, Stalybridge; Corporal Harvey Holmes, Hyde; Corporal Terry Webster, Chester; Lance Corporal Andrew Breeze, Manchester; Marine Steven Birdsall, Warrington; Marine Paul Warren, Preston; Sergeant Steven Darbyshire, Wigan; Private Alex Isaac, Wirral; Private Douglas Halliday, Wallasey; Colour Sergeant Martyn Horton, Runcorn; Private Thomas Sephton, Warrington; Sergeant David Monkhouse, Cumbria; Sapper Darren Foster, Carlisle; Lance Corporal Jordan Bancroft, Burnley; Kingsman Darren Deady, Bolton; Guardsman Christopher Davies, St Helens. What a criminal waste of brave young lives! It is, of course, no business of the European Union what wars Britain should or should not fight. That is for the British people and our elected representatives in our House of Parliament in Westminster to decide, just as it will be for us to decide one happy day to put Messrs Blair, Brown and Cameron on trial for war crimes, because Afghanistan, just like Iraq, is a criminal war.

– Mr President, as carbon crooks and One World Government conspirators celebrate their advances at Cancún, UK Prime Minister Dave Cameron declared his satisfaction with the outcome. At the end of the coldest first half of December in central England since records began in 1772, Dave is satisfied that the Green Climate Fund will cost British taxpayers GBP 2.9 billion on top of the GBP 18.3 billion a year that the Climate Change Act siphons from British consumers for the corporate crooks in the green industrial complex. Coincidently, GBP 2.9 billion is also the amount the Treasury will save by increasing the debts of British students, condemning them to a lifetime of bondage to the banks. That scam has already caused student riots. Taxpayer riots over far bigger scams – bail-outs to corrupt and incompetent banks, propping up the zombie euro and the global warming hoax – are yet to come, but come they will and, unlike Prince Charles and Camilla, their targets will deserve everything they get. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, I should like to say to the Commissioner that the new energy strategy report ignores the elephant in the living room: peak oil. But at least the Commission has at last woken up to this gigantic and immediate threat. The moment one recognises peak oil, the majority of this largely well-meaning report becomes, sadly, incinerator fuel. The huge energy gap opening up cannot possibly be filled by Mickey Mouse renewables or shale carbons. Coal, nuclear fusion – and in the long term nuclear fusion plus fission – are the only energy sources dense enough to save us as the oil age comes to an end. Commissioner, now that this has been recognised, can we look forward to a new, serious approach to energy? We must ditch all the nonsense about wind-power grids and global warming and concentrate on real scientific solutions to the peak oil crisis. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, choosing sunny Mexico for COP 16 was a good move. We should be spared a repeat of last year’s embarrassment, when global warmists shivered in the coldest Copenhagen December for decades. Likewise, using the deceitfully ambiguous term ‘climate change’ rather than ‘global warming’ may blind a few British taxpayers to the irony of holding it just as an unusually cold summer gives way to an early, icy winter. An even better trick would be to hold these events only in the spring: look, it is getting warmer every day. How much longer can the fascistic EU impose ever more punitive taxes and controls on ordinary citizens on the pretext of man-made global warming, when an ever-increasing number of real scientists are rejecting the theory as unfounded and demolished? AGW is baseless propaganda, a Josef Goebbels-scale big lie from the green industrial complex because they favour massive transfers of wealth from the little people to carbon-trading crooks, such as Al Gore and Goldman Sachs. And it is being exploited by leftist political elites to complete the deindustrialisation of the west because spineless conservatives are too browbeaten by global warming hysteria to stand up and tell the really inconvenient truth: man-made climate change is the most profitable con trick in history. This year’s Bilderberg conference, held in Spain in June, included a session on the dangers of global cooling. When will the new realism of the people who really shape global politics creep in here, among the people who merely think they do? Andrew Henry William Brons and Nick Griffin  (NI

– We abstained on the Bilbao Barandica, Gallagher and Ferreira reports on the grounds that they contained beneficial and harmful proposals in the same instrument. However, we voted in favour of the Gróbarczyk report, despite having misgivings about some of its content (e.g. its suggestion that the discard system might have worked well for certain species of fish – we are opposed to the discard system completely). We voted in favour of it because it promised a review of the discard system. This is about as much as we can hope for within the confines of the common fisheries policy. Nick Griffin  (NI
).  
– Mr President, it is good that the EU is trying to preserve endangered fish stocks, but before there is too much self-congratulation on these proposals, we must remember that many past EU fishing rules have been appalling failures. Britain’s home waters have been fished to near extinction under European fisheries policies. The reality is that the protection of fish stocks is best left to local fishermen and national government marine scientists, not EU bureaucrats. The advice from the men working in the broken remnants of Britain’s fishing fleets is simple: scrap quota systems, which lead to discards and high grading, and replace them with weight-based catch limits so that all fish caught are landed for human consumption or for processing into animal and fish feed. We need to replace the system of openly tradeable quotas and so stop financiers, supermarkets and the super rich from speculating in fishermen’s livelihoods. Quotas of all kinds – and in whichever seas – should be owned by fishermen from ports with traditional connections to those waters and be tradeable only between fishermen who are likewise entitled to fish by personal, family and community connections. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, before taking advice from any expert it is wise to examine their record to check that they are competent. The Integrated Maritime Policy report is partly the work of the Committee on Fisheries, so before buying into its grand schemes it is worthwhile taking a critical look at the European Union’s record on the management of the seas. Inevitably, this means assessing the situation in the former sovereign UK waters, secretly betrayed to European bureaucracy control in 1973, since nearly 70% of so-called ‘EU fishing stocks’ are actually British fishing stocks. How have our fish and our fishermen fared under the common fisheries policy (CFP)? The figures tell us far more than all the fine words in this report. 88% of the EU’s stocks are overfished, against a global average of about 27%. 30% of our fish species are now officially outside safe biological limits, because there are too few adult fish left for normal reproduction. Under the CFP’s obscene quota system, nearly a million tonnes of fish are discarded dead into the North Sea alone every year. Meanwhile, the industrial hoovering-up of species such as sand eels has led to crashing populations of bird species such as puffins. To Europe’s south, the picture is just as bad. West African fishermen, whose lifestyle had been sustained for generations, are being forced to switch to people trafficking because EU-registered vessels have helped fish their waters to extinction. It is time for the EU to acknowledge that its record in maritime management is the worst in the entire world, a typical example of what is known as the tragedy of the commons – the phenomenon by which shared resources always get exploited ruthlessly, because anyone who exercises restraint is disadvantaged by the unscrupulous. It is time to restore control of the seas and fishing grounds to the sovereign nations, whose track record has shown them fit to exercise such stewardship. In the case of the two-thirds of EU waters that the EU has fished to extinction, that means the British nation and British fishermen. Nick Griffin  (NI
).  
– Mr President, as is so often the case with EU proposals, these financial instruments include measures which have great emotional appeal. All decent people like us want to stop drug smuggling, people trafficking and the supply of small arms to conflict zones, but it is very easy to be emotional and generous with other people’s money. Thus, while ordinary people in Greece, France, Ireland and Great Britain are having their societies ripped apart by cuts and their backs broken by taxes, the Scholz report will add EUR 176 million to the EUR 172 million already committed to help third-world capitalists gobble up even more of our jobs. The Goerens report will blow EUR 190 million, including EUR 17.4 million for a facility for rapid response to soaring food prices in developing countries. It may have escaped your attention, but food prices are soaring in our constituencies as well. Worst of all, however, is the Brantner report. Here, on page nine, it speaks of a financial envelope of EUR 2 062 billion by 2013. This is, of course, a misprint. I hope to God it is a misprint, but the fact that such a ridiculous error could slip past all the experts and MEPs who have read this report speaks volumes for the careless abandon with which the European Union spends money. This money does not grow on trees. It is not handed out by a giant tooth fairy. It is not the Commission’s money; it is not MEPs’ money. It is taxpayers’ money and a hugely disproportionate amount of it is British taxpayers’ money. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Madam President, the real significance of the Deepwater disaster is being missed. The real question is why BP is drilling for oil through 5 000 metres of rock, in water 1 500 metres deep, in the middle of a hurricane zone. The answer is peak oil – the point at which we have used the half of the world’s reserves that were easy, safe and cheap to produce, and now rely on shrinking reserves which are increasingly inaccessible, dangerous and expensive, both financially and environmentally. Deepwater is merely a symptom of peak oil. Using it as an excuse for yet another EU power grab will not stop us reaching peak or suffering its potentially catastrophic consequences. Instead of talking about symptoms, it is time to get serious about the disease: the fact that we have used all the easy oil and are still addicted to the stuff. In recent months, this reality has begun to dawn on – among others – President Obama, the British Government and the German military. It is time for the EU to take its head out of the sand, stop obsessing about climate change, and study and address the real crisis: peak oil. Nick Griffin  (NI

Mr President, the prospect of being jailed for thought crimes is shocking. Unlike most of the people here, I can tell you that from personal experience. The British Government has tried to jail me three times under anti-free-speech laws that state that telling the truth is no defence. So I am very sympathetic to Chinese, and especially Tibetan, dissidents forced into slave labour in Communist prison camps. Steps must be taken to prevent the goods they make being allowed to undercut manufacturing and workers in the West. But, if one accepts that items made by forced labour constitute unfair competition, it is impossible to avoid the same conclusion about goods made by sweated labour, by workers who are not allowed to organise into trade unions in a country where there are no environmental protection costs. The truth is that all manufactured goods from China constitute unfair competition. Trade with China, far from being free, costs millions of jobs and destroys our manufacturing base. It is time to protect our workers from this unholy alliance of Communist tyranny and capitalist greed. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, lawyers chase ambulances: where there is an accident, there is a parasite rushing in to profit from someone’s misfortune. The advocates of European Union are ambulance-chasers extraordinaire: from the fantasy of man-made global warming, to earthquakes and forest fires, every crisis becomes an excuse to grab even more power. The Russia-Ukraine gas crisis was an artificial problem caused by neo-con interference in the politics of Eastern Europe. The answer is to stop ‘baiting the bear’ and to leave the nations of Europe free to buy the gas that Russia needs to sell us. Instead, the crisis is used as an excuse for the EU to seize control of gas supplies and ensnare us all in a web of interdependence designed to enforce the Union that voters would never approve. This is not about gas supplies. It is the creeping tyranny of a Socialist superstate using deceit to grab what it cannot get democratically. When it drops the mask of reasonable necessity, its new fascism will be imposed, not with castor oil, but with deadly cold. That is why freedom lovers will vote against this report. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Madam President, the defining feature of the EU conspiracy, apart from endemic waste and fraud, is that it rides roughshod over the wishes of real people. The push to bully Iceland into surrendering to EU rule is an example. Gallup polls reveal that 60% of Icelanders want to retain their freedom by staying out of the EU. Only 26% are now fooled by the pro-Union propaganda of the corporate media. This is no surprise. Icelanders have the oldest tradition of true democracy in the world. They do not want to exchange it for rule by unelected commissars. Icelanders have some of the last great fish stocks in the world. They want to preserve them from being destroyed, as EU membership has destroyed Britain’s fish stocks. Icelanders are proud of their Viking origins, vibrant culture and identity. EU rule would doom Reykjavik to becoming a scale model of the Muslim ghettos of ‘Londonistan’, Paris, Brussels and Copenhagen! So, from the belly of the Euro beast, I urge the people of Iceland: stay free! Say ‘no’ to European Union! Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, the EU’s strategy for jobs sounds good, but the reality behind the scenes is very different. To take just one shocking example, the forthcoming trade agreement between the EU and India will have a devastating impact on Indian agriculture and pharmaceuticals. Indians are rightly worried by this threat to their prosperity and independence. But with the Indians giving up so much, we need to ask what is in it for Indian big business and what is it going to cost workers in Britain and Europe. The answer is Mode 4 immigration, which bypasses any national caps on immigration. Transnational corporations will gain the automatic right to bring in Indian labour to replace, for example, skilled British workers in steel and car plants and all the other industries now owned by Indian-based TNCs. The India-EU trade agreement will devastate the wages and employment prospects of hundreds of thousands of British and European workers. This is not a strategy for jobs but a naked sell-out to corporate greed. Nick Griffin  (NI

– A permanent shortage of organs for transplantation hampers the wonderful efforts of health care professionals to help patients. It is also a sad fact that there is a shortage of donors, and that this drives some vile criminal activities. To seek to address these problems by creating an EU-wide database is, however, a mistake. It is naive to place hopes in a database covering the whole of the EU, with all its different languages and IT systems, when the failed attempt to produce a Health Service database for the UK alone has wasted billions of pounds. Health services across Europe are unable even to fund basics, and face savage cuts as ordinary citizens pay for the bust of globalism. This being so, far more can be done to encourage organ donations by investing in education programmes at national levels, than by diverting funds to pay for well-intentioned bureaucratic meddling. Additionally, there are tight time constraints on organ viability. Thus, an EU-wide network would be of use to very few patients. Proposals to set one up are another pretty-sounding excuse for the further advance of an agenda that has nothing to do with patients’ welfare and everything to do with federalist dogma.

– Mr President, the most important priority of any budget should be only to spend your own money. Spending someone else’s without their permission is not budgeting, it is theft. British taxpayers are fleeced to the tune of GBP 6.4 billion in direct payments to the EU annually and we are still denied our referendum. Taking that money, without a democratic mandate, is not a victimless crime. Fifty thousand of our pensioners died of cold this winter because they could not afford to heat their own homes. Our soldiers are killed by Taliban bombs because we cannot afford blast-proof vehicles. Thousands of cancer victims are denied expensive life-saving drugs. GBP 6.4 billion would right all those wrongs and still leave change to build eight new hospitals and 50 schools. There should be only one budget priority – slash spending and stop robbing Britain.

– Madam President, there is an English folk tale about King Canute who, by ordering the tide not to come in and wet his feet, showed his courtiers that not even kings are exempt from reality. In doing so, he became a byword for arrogant folly. King Canute lives on in the Council of the European Union, which begins and ends its conclusion on Arctic affairs with the alleged importance of global warming. This involves a refusal to accept scientific reality. According to the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre, Arctic summer ice has increased by 409 000 square miles, or 26%, since 2007. This is exactly what was predicted by scientists aware that the previous shrinkage of summer ice, wrongly used as evidence for global warming, was in fact nothing more than a snapshot of an ages-old natural cyclical pulse of advance, retreat and advance. So the Arctic summer ice will not vanish by 2013 and polar bears have not, and will not, drown because of global warming. But millions of hard-working voters are drowning in a sea of debt and taxes, and they are growing very impatient with the political class’s use of the global warming fraud to impose undemocratic international governance and bogus green taxes. The UN has now announced a review of the IPCC’s dodgy dossiers and fiddled statistics. On behalf of the taxpayers of Britain, I ask this Parliament to do the same and to stop wasting any more money on the most expensive big lie in human history. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, discussing tax cooperation during the current euro crisis is rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic
. The southern nations are known in English by the harsh acronym PIGS (Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain). However, those being crucified on the euro are not pigs but people, scourged by utopian one-size-fits-all dogma. Their economies will either die of a thousand cuts or be bailed out, to the ruin of taxpayers in Britain and elsewhere. There will be very little tax to cooperate over. There are two ways out: either abolish the euro and return to the captive nations of this Strawberry Soviet their own currencies, or expel the ‘problem countries’ from the euro. That might be the PIGS. More justly, it would be Germany and her French collaborator, because running the euro according to German interests is the root of this shambles. This endless crisis will destroy the federal project – tax cooperation and all. The tragedy is that it will grind so many innocent victims into poverty before it does so. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, after Copenhagen, let us reassess the whole global warming story. At Copenhagen, we had the irony of not just ‘Climategate II’, but also the onset of one of the harshest winters in decades. Since then, we have seen the debunking of the Potsdam sea-level scare; the Goddard Institute has been caught fiddling the temperature records; the vanishing Himalayan glaciers have been exposed as a fantasy; Mr Pachauri has emerged as a climate change profiteer. The world is cooling. Global warming is a fraud. This is not a victimless crime. Carbon taxes push up fuel prices, killing our old folk as we speak. The billions wasted researching this non-existent problem are billions that cannot be spent defeating real scourges such as Alzheimer’s, or ending real environmental disasters such as deforestation. Carbon credit trading makes billions for City sharks at the expense of families in poverty. The loss of agricultural land to biofuels has already doubled world food prices, so millions are starving while greedy corporations make even fatter profits. Those pushing the unscientific nonsense of man-made climate change – Shell, Monsanto, the international banks, Bilderberg one-worlders, carbon billionaires and their useful idiot allies on the left – are running the biggest fraud in human history. They must and will be called to account, as should their collaborators in places such as this. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, the horror of Haiti is shocking. It is only human to feel compassion for the innocent victims of the natural disaster there. All of us here are well paid and can afford to give. I will give my attendance allowance for today if every British MEP will do the same. However, with their taxes, our constituents cannot afford your generosity. Globalism has destroyed our industries. The banks have ruined our economies. EU red tape is strangling our entrepreneurs and the carbon-tax scam is plunging millions into deadly fuel poverty. The death toll in Haiti is shocking, but this winter, more than 50 000 pensioners in Britain alone will die premature deaths because of the cold and the cost of heating. Across Europe, the death toll will run into hundreds of thousands, but, because this truth shames the political elite and because it highlights the inconvenient truth of global cooling, this scandal will be buried as quietly as are our elderly dead. Hundreds of thousands of our own people are dying because of government neglect and EU cold taxes, yet you insist on throwing other people’s money at a disaster in somebody else’s back yard. That is not compassion: that is stinking hypocrisy. I know this place is uneasy with our Christian heritage, but as always, our Bible reveals an eternal truth that most here would rather ignore – first book of Timothy, 5:8: ‘but if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.’ Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, two months ago, my constituency was hit by disastrous floods. Deceitfully blamed on climate change, the real reason for the devastation of the town of Cockermouth was the EU-imposed privatisation/theft of public services. The proper management of reservoirs has been replaced by cost-cutting negligence by United Utilities, leading to safety margins being ignored and a panic-stricken decision to open sluice gates and release a man-made deluge on the town. The fact that only one brave man died in the floods was little short of miraculous, but such disasters will increase in frequency as more and more public services are looted by greedy corporations. Finally, my constituents are shocked that they will not receive a penny from the EU Solidarity Fund, because the UK cannot apply unless the damage exceeds EUR 3 billion. Since Britain is not in an earthquake zone, it is almost impossible to conceive of a disaster which would trigger such a payment, so British taxpayers – who contribute a disproportionate amount to the funds – have no realistic chance of benefiting from it. So much for solidarity. We want our money back! Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, everyone agrees that climate change is the biggest challenge facing humanity: that is the constant claim of the political elite, and it is a lie. Everyone does not agree. Thousands of scientists dispute the very existence of man-made global warming, citing natural cyclical changes that saw vineyards in Roman northern England and a Swedish army march over the frozen Baltic to Copenhagen in 1658. As an army of global-warming zealots marches to Copenhagen, the truth is that their Orwellian consensus is based not on scientific agreement, but on bullying, censorship and fraudulent statistics. In the words of leading climatologist Professor Lindzen, ‘Future generations will wonder in bemused amazement that the early 21st century’s developed world went into hysterical panic over a globally averaged temperature increase of a few tenths of a degree and, on the basis of gross exaggerations of highly uncertain computer projections [...], contemplated a rollback of the industrial age’. In fact, there will be no bemused amazement, for the reason for this hysteria is clear. It is designed to provide the excuse for a political project of the globalists to replace national democracy with new world order global governance. It has nothing to do with science and everything to do with the globalist common purpose to tax and control us, while making billions for corporations in the green industrial complex. The anti-Western intellectual cranks of the Left suffered a collective breakdown when Communism collapsed. Climate change is their new theology, a secular religious hysteria complete with Pope – Al Gore – carbon-credit indulgences and the persecution of heretics. But the heretics will have a voice in Copenhagen and the truth will out. Climate change is being used to impose an anti-human utopia as deadly as anything conceived by Stalin or Mao.

– Madam President, there is endless rhetoric here about friendship and cooperation between every state under the sun except for Russia. China commits genocide in Tibet. Turkey denies its Armenian holocaust. The USA flattens Iraq and this place fawns on them. But for Russia, there are only pompous and hypocritical lectures. This confrontational Russia phobia shamefully feeds the new Cold War drive of America’s warmongering neo-con lobby. Of course, there are some local differences between Russia and her neighbours, but can we not agree that next week’s summit should be used to attempt to build bridges and cooperation between the eastern and western halves of our civilisation? For historical and cultural reasons, this is far more practical and safer than attempting to create unity with Turkey, Europe’s ancient and eternal enemy. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Madam President, in the last two months, I have suffered victimisation by the UK Labour regime, including withdrawal of my House of Commons pass, refusal to allow me to enter the Sellafield nuclear processing plant – despite my position on a subcommittee of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – and the refusal of the Citizens’ Advice Bureau to sell me an information database openly advertised for sale to all other MEPs. Madam President, would you agree that political discrimination is not only unlawful but is also an attack not just on me, but also on the functionality of this place and, most important of all, on the voters and the entire democratic process? Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, there are two overriding themes in this place: first, concern with the growing gulf between the political elite and the ordinary taxpayers. Second, a hysterical obsession with man-made global warming. These two themes are intimately linked. The global-warming fixation is a classic example of how the political class here is out of touch with the little people who have to pay the bills. While the EU backs the Copenhagen proposals to further the deindustrialisation of the West and the corporate domination of the Third World, a growing majority of ordinary people regard climate change as an elite scam – an excuse to tax and control us and to impose internationalist dogma and global government at the expense of the nation state. Can you not see the danger in this growing gulf? It is time to look at the facts. Man-made global warming is an unproven theory based on manipulative statistics. The so-called consensus on the issue is the product not of debate but of the suppression of expert dissent. Before the political class and the green industrial complex dare to impose a single new tax, poisoned light bulb or useless wind farm on the ordinary taxpayer, they need to try to convince the public that global warming is
 man-made, that returning to the warmer climate of medieval times would be a bad thing and that there is something that Europe – as opposed to the United States, China and India – can actually do about it. Either hold a debate and close the gap between you and the people, or do not complain when we nationalists – the ones who listen to the people – close it for you. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, last year I served as a monitor at commemorations for the 1956 revolution in Budapest. I can confirm that Dr Morvai is right to criticise those who fret about Iran while ignoring human rights abuses here in Europe. I trust that no ECR Group members here will be hypocritical enough to condemn Iran for the use of violence in elections when David Cameron is among the sponsors of Unite Against Fascism, an organisation of far-left criminals which routinely deploys intimidation and violence against nationalist dissidents in Britain. The same is true of five current Labour, Lib Dem and Tory MEPs, marked with the shame of supporting the use of British taxpayers’ money to support their own militia, which breaks up opposition meetings and attacks their opponents with bricks, darts and claw hammers. But my main point is this: however well meaning, and even justified, criticisms of Iran made here may be, they will be exploited as war propaganda by the powerful vested interests that stand to gain from a military attack on that country. Neocons, oil companies, construction corporations and the Wahabi mullahs of Saudi Arabia all want to see the sovereign state of Iran destroyed by an aggressive war. Not even European liberals are naive enough to fall for lies about weapons of mass destruction again, so human rights are being drafted in as a new casus belli
. Do not add the voice of this place to the warmongers’ chorus for a third illegal and counterproductive attack by the West on the Muslim world. Or, if you must, do not leave the war – which hypocritical rhetoric will help to justify and unleash – to the usual brave British cannon fodder: 18-year-old boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne. Instead, send your own sons to come home in boxes or without their legs, their arms and their sanity – or mind your own business.Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, there is a principle in English civil law called ‘to one who is willing, no harm is done’. In other words, you cannot sue if you put yourself in danger of loss or injury. These illegal immigrants were not kidnapped in their own countries by wicked Europeans who then brought them to Europe and incarcerated them for eighteen months or more. They chose to enter an EU country illegally and then avoided being repatriated. Presumably they are free to return to their countries of origin, but refuse to do so. We have heard that illegal immigrants – those who do not leave – are usually given a piece of paper ordering them to leave, in order to avoid them disappearing. If their stay is a long one it is usually because of extensive court actions to avoid repatriation. While talking about a breach of the Returns Directive, we learned in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on 31 March that in 2012 only 37% of those given a return decision eventually left. The other 63% remained. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, we are hearing the 1914 language of self-righteous indignation to imply that one side is completely in the right and the others completely in the wrong. We might not like Mr Yanukovych – and there is much about him I do not like, if it is true – but his removal as President did not fall within the categories in Article 108 of the Constitution of Ukraine, and the procedure for impeachment in Article 111 was not followed. The civil disturbances in Ukraine were orchestrated from the EU when Yanukovych rejected the EU trade agreement. This was just as much interference in Ukraine, and with less justification, than anything that Russia has done. The taped conversation of Victoria Nuland and Geoffrey Pyatt about who should lead Ukraine was evidence of blatant US interference. It is all very well to call a referendum held by the Crimean Autonomous Republic illegal, but this was no more illegal than the removal of Mr[nbsp ]Yanukovych. Crimea had traditionally been part of Russia since the 18th Century, until 1954 when it was handed over by Mr Khrushchev, a Soviet leader of Ukrainian descent. The recent referendum was hurried and insufficiently debated, but the result was hardly ambiguous. Large powers, like Russia and the United States, have what they see as legitimate spheres of interest. The United States was not going to allow Soviet missiles in Cuba in 1962. Russia was not prepared to accept with equanimity a member of the EU and NATO within its traditional borders.

 Mr President, ‘own resources’ is a rather misleading euphemism. The EU has only the resources of its Member States, so their populations pay taxes perhaps more directly to the EU instead of through the treasuries of Member States. One of the purposes might be to disguise which countries are net contributors and which are net recipients, thus obviating the necessity for rebates and correction mechanisms and replacing them by a series of lump-sum payments over the next six years. You also remove from potentially rebellious Member States the power to threaten to withhold contributions from the EU. There is also a symbolic – or perhaps a psychological – significance of people paying taxes directly to the EU. It sends a subliminal message to taxpayers that the EU has the status of a state. How will own resources be enforced? By using officials and judges employed by Member States? Or perhaps new EU tax officials and courts will emerge, as though from nowhere.

 Mr President, the 2012 report of RAPEX reported that there had been a 26% increase in the number of alerts for dangerous products. This was not just the result of greater market surveillance, as the rapporteur said; the number of dangerous products really was increasing. Do we know the countries from which these products come? There have been some coded hints this morning, but only coded ones. On 20[nbsp ]January, we learnt from a debate on a proposed regulation for consumer protection that 58% of notifications for dangerous products related to goods from China, and that in a further 16% of cases it was not possible to identify the country of origin. Importation of cheap goods from emergent economies does not only undermine our manufacturing basis (and of course the jobs of our workers), it also has the potential for injuring our consumers. Freedom of movement of goods – not just within the EU, but globally – is the root cause of dangerous products in our markets. The EU is not so much a European Union, as it is becoming a global union.

 Madam President, EU legislation, unlike trade, does not extend beyond its borders, so it might not answer all the animal health needs of animals originating in third countries. This regulation would replace complex existing legislation and much of its substantive content would certainly be beneficial. Healthy farm animals are recognised as a prerequisite of human health. Whilst the rapporteur acknowledges that this is not primarily an animal protection law, she quotes with approval the description in a parallel regulation that animals are sentient beings and has written that the legislation protecting live animals when travelling should be amended to reflect distances travelled rather than just borders crossed. Sentient beings can feel pain and suffer from discomfort and fear. Ritualistic slaughter of animals without pre-stunning is self-evidently cruel treatment of a sentient being. Food from such an animal will not of course be a hazard to human health, but it will be a wound to civilised sensibilities. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, the nature-nurture debate used to be the most important in politics and was the key to a whole range of political views. The nurture side had much to be said for it – perceived kindness and fairness and, of course, non-discrimination. The nature side had only evidence to support it.  However, nurture now seems to have been declared the winner without a contest. Indeed, nature has been airbrushed out of the picture, even as a contestant. All public policies, whether devised by left, right, centrist or a populist safety valve, base their policies on a false assumption. They assume equal potential ability, which does no favours to those without it. They assume third world migrants can be substitute Europeans, when they only turn Europe into the third world. They confuse social mobility with equality of opportunity and do not realise that the latter will eventually bring the former to a shuddering halt. They throw money at continents that cannot benefit from it, because Europe takes their brightest and best. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, the External Action Service seeks to develop a common policy and only then persuade or cajole Member States to adhere to it. I am in favour of joint action, but only when it is necessary. This must be based on prior agreement on objectives and a genuine commonality of interests, not a shared desire for aggressive adventurism.  Paragraph[nbsp ]25 states that there is a strong link between development and conflict prevention. European States should therefore stop fomenting conflict in other countries that can cause devastating recession and dire poverty. Of course, the greatest reason for stagnation in the poorest of countries is a dearth of talent. This is made worse by northern countries looting what talent they have, generation after generation. We must reverse the brain drain and encourage their brightest and best to reinvest their abilities in the countries of their birth or descent. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, I am not an admirer of the Iranian Islamic Republic, but there are many repressive countries in the world and some of them are the West’s allies. Iran has been involved in only one war in recent decades, with Iraq. It is widely accepted that Iraq was the instigator of that conflict. I am afraid I cannot judge whether Iran has only a civil nuclear programme, but the claims about Iraq proved to be unfounded.  There is a certain irony in the fact that many of Iran’s critics, the United States and Israel among them, have been involved in conflicts in the past and have nuclear weapons. I am sceptical about the foreign policy priorities of the United States, though I must say the present administration is showing more restraint than its republican predecessor. I am no supporter of the European External Action Service or of the position of High Representative. However, if an agreement between the United States and Iran, encouraged by Baroness Ashton, prevents conflict and normalises relations it, and she, must be applauded. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, to find out what a meeting is about, it is sometimes necessary to put together different sources as though they were pieces in an intricate jigsaw. The agenda of the forthcoming meeting refers to the European Semester which, among other things, includes inspection by the Commission of reform programmes, including reforms of the labour market. The agenda also mentions industrial competitiveness and the importance of a strong and competitive industrial base as a driver for economic growth and jobs. If we refer back to a meeting of ECOFIN, held on 16[nbsp ]February[nbsp ]2012, about the European Semester of that year, we find that ‘reforms need to focus on labour markets – in particular wage-setting mechanisms – to ensure efficient adjustment of labour costs’. What does all this mean? It means that a relatively high-wage economy, or group of economies, embracing the ideology of globalism and the process of globalisation, must drive down wages to compete with the emergent economies.

 Mr President, the present crisis in Ukraine did not start with a Russian invasion. It started with the EU’s reaction to Ukraine’s rejection of the EU-Ukrainian trade deal. This reaction took the form of the EU’s friends in that country exploiting Ukrainian nationalists to provide paramilitary assistance on the streets. I am no supporter of Mr Yanukovych, of his political or personal background or his tactics against demonstrators. However, the Ukrainian Parliament does not have the power simply to remove the president under Article 108, and it does not appear that the impeachment procedures under Article 111 were followed. The EU is determined to ensnare Ukraine by bribery and intimidation. I certainly do not view the presence of Russian troops in the Ukraine with equanimity; I would like them to withdraw. However, Russia is reacting to extreme acts of provocation, not just by the EU but also the US. We know this … (The President cut off the speaker) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, Mr Cercas’s report explains succinctly the formula being applied to the countries investigated: wage freezes and cuts, cuts in welfare spending, part-time and temporary work, and involuntary emigration. It then leaps to three laudable objectives: increased employment, reduction in poverty and reduction in school drop-out rates. It quite rightly calls for an end to austerity. You do not make people richer or reduce their indebtedness by making them poorer. However, its other recommendations lack substance or definition and amount to a prayer for things to improve. It shies away from the root cause: the fact that the euro’s value is too high for their economies. Only withdrawal from the eurozone and a reintroduction of their national currencies, which will fall in value, will allow them to enjoy export-led expansions. The austerity programmes were designed to save the eurozone; they were not designed to help the four countries concerned. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, I am not an EU enthusiast at all, and I can see even less justification for the EU to facilitate investment in countries beyond its borders. In the case of countries in Eastern Europe, I suppose it can be seen as a bribe to lure them into becoming candidate countries and surrendering their sovereignty. North African countries, of course, are not eligible to be members, at least under present rules, but their receipt of investment is a sign that the EU is not so much a European Union as a global union in waiting. There will undoubtedly be people in the still-crisis-ridden states of the South who wonder why all such available money is not being invested there. The answer might be that investment will be less effective in those countries when expansion is constrained by a currency that is overvalued for their economies. Indeed, withdrawal from the eurozone for those countries would be a prerequisite for effective investment. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, the existence of the EIB is justified on the grounds of perceived need. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) bemoans the fact that there was a lack of sustainable and viable projects that were eligible for EIB funding. It appears that the EIB criteria did not match the investment need. There is certainly a need for investment in infrastructure in the Member States. However, investment can be carried out more cheaply, more efficiently and in a more targeted way by those Member States creating the credit themselves rather than borrowing from external institutions and adding sovereign debt. The principle of ‘what is physically possible must be financially possible’ should be followed. President Obama, no less, when introducing the American Jobs Act, said it was a contradiction for a bridge in Maine to be in need of repair while construction workers were unemployed. However, the resolution of that contradiction seems to have eluded him. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, the explanatory memorandum in Ms[nbsp ]Zuberʼs report says that the effects of austerity in Greece, Ireland, Portugal and elsewhere are that women are suffering disproportionately, but of course all workers are suffering from those measures, not just women. The urgent need is to end the austerity programmes she refers to, and membership of the euro area which is the thing that they are supposed to sustain. When those countries benefit from an export-led expansion following withdrawal from the euro area, there will indeed be prosperity to be divided fairly between men and women, which must happen. To seek to divide austerity fairly is to exonerate its architects from responsibility and distract attention from the cause of their suffering. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, in my first debate in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) five years ago, a noblewoman of Liberal persuasion convinced herself that I did not know the difference between people travelling with or without a visa, on the one hand, and immigrants on the other. I think that I remarked that I did know the difference but sometimes the travellers did not.  People who travel from poor countries to relatively rich ones are not always scrupulously honest about their purposes for, or the intended length of, their visit. In a recent debate in LIBE, a representative of the Commission warned against confusing visa facilitation and visa liberalisation and said that easing the procedure for obtaining the visa, as distinct from waiving it, would not allow the visa holder to overstay. The visa overstayer, he implied, would be waiting in the place he was supposed to have been for the authorities to collect him and return him to his own country.  I have heard the Commission accused of many things but I did not think that naivety was among them. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, in the eyes of the EU all rights are equal but some are more equal than others. In any democracy the political rights – freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and electoral rights – should be pre-eminent. Why? Because they are the key to all the others: their recognition, their extent and their limitations. Indeed many of the personal rights were established only with the exercise of these political rights. However, the EU regards the personal rights – chosen or determined behaviour, freedom from constraint, prohibition of discrimination, freedom of movement – to be paramount. If there should be a conflict between, say, freedom of expression and one of these personal rights, freedom of expression would be the loser. What they are really saying is that the political rights were simply vehicles for campaigning for their range of personal rights. Once these have been elevated to the status of having self-evident virtue, the political rights have served their use and have become redundant. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, this report starts innocently enough by referring to conditions of entry for ostensibly short-term visitors, such as exchange pupils or au[nbsp ]pairs. Then the pretences are cast aside and it admits that it is just a prelude to large-scale permanent immigration, eleven million in the current decade. Why? The pretext is Europe’s ageing population caused, in part, by women’s enslavement to economic forces and subservience to anti-family propaganda. The report envisages ‘third-country’, for which you can often read Third World, immigrants with their large families becoming replacement Europeans. Well, they won’t. They will continue to turn more and more parts of Europe into the Third World. You cannot change a person’s identity by changing his or her country or continent of residence. Furthermore, you do not help poorer countries by robbing them of their most skilled and able workers.

 Madam President, when the history of the 21st century is written it could be remembered as the one in which Europeans were ethnically cleansed from large parts of their homelands. Within my lifetime large parts of the cities of many countries in the West have been transformed into outposts of Africa and Asia. By the end of the century the East will probably be transformed in the same way.  Now it has not happened autonomously like the wind and tides; it has been brought about deliberately by the people who misrule us: the political class. When the peoples of Europe are no longer the pre-eminent populations our distinctive culture will be no more. Distinctive peoples are not the product of distinctive cultures; distinctive cultures are the product of distinctive peoples. Demographic change is not just about numbers and space. It is about the identities of the peoples doing the replacing and the people being replaced. There is still time for Europeans nationally, and in cooperation, to alter their destiny and take control of their own future. It will require moral courage, determination and resolution.

 Mr President, if you start with the premise that admitting seasonal workers was an economic necessity and would happen anyway, there might be something to be said for at least part of this report. The conditions of work of the seasonal workers in Rosarno, where we went in 2010, were truly appalling. Allowing those sorts of conditions, wages and accommodation to be tolerated would be inhumane and would encourage employers to hire third-country workers before home or EU workers. However, allowing third-country workers to apply from within the EU for seasonal work would reward illegal migrants and encourage the entry of more. Allowing people admitted for another purpose to apply would invite abuse of the admission system.  Nine to twelve months is more than a season. I should like to see the evidence for the conclusion that national and other EU workers would be unwilling to take seasonal work. Many long-term unemployed would be pleased to have paid work with accommodation provided in their own country, or at least in their own continent. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, the ethnic and religious conflict is obviously the most pressing problem, but in a way it distracts us from the underlying long-term problems of poverty, a lack of economic development and a fragile civic infrastructure. We must understand the nature of these problems if they are to be solved.  Now these problems are not just the product of the decades following independence or, for that matter, of the colonial experience. Despite being rich in natural resources and having favourable agricultural conditions, the CAR is one of the world’s poorest countries. We might ask why the area of the Central African Republic, and the rest of sub-Saharan Africa for that matter, did not develop the instruments of technology and transport and use them to spread the fruits of their discoveries, learning and creativity throughout the world in the way that Europe did. If there has been, and continues to be, a hindrance to development it must be identified and addressed. When we address that question honestly we might be ready to start solving Africa’s problems.

 Mr President, insider dealing and market manipulation are undoubtedly wrong and harm countless numbers of people. They are not victimless crimes and should be subject to criminal sanctions. The argument is that when a market becomes international, the regulation must also become international. From that it is concluded that EU legislation is called for – surprise, surprise. There is a slight flaw in the logic or at least in one of the premises. The terms EU and international are not synonymous. What is required is an international treaty, signed by all significant trading countries, to the effect that the signatory countries will legislate for stated minimum standards of legislation. In this example, as in many others, EU harmonising legislation is the objective and the prevention of insider dealer and market manipulation is simply the pretext. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, if you start from a position of 28 countries locked into the EU, and all of them locked into the global trade system governed by the World Trade Organisation, you might be forgiven for thinking that there was some merit in the Commission’s proposal, for example, to modify the lesser duty rule, or to impose provisional duties after establishing proof of what even the EU would consider to be dumping. However, I am tempted to take the part of the man in the joke who, when asked for directions, replied: ‘I would not have started from here.’  I am opposed to EU controls over my country’s ability to manage its own trade. However, I am even more concerned about the EU and the WTO facilitating trade with low-wage economies with whose manufactured goods we cannot possibly compete, and which constitute dumping, without any investigation being necessary.

 Mr President, for a tax to attract one or two non-partisan critics would be unfortunate. To attract dozens sounds a bit like carelessness. The tax is superficially appealing as a levy on institutions blamed for the recession: a tax on the rich to benefit the poor. But, as one critic said: banks simply pass down their taxes to us, the customers. Indeed, the FTT would be levied most heavily on long-term investments such as those of pension funds. The good news is that it will be levied in only eleven countries. The bad news is that it might be drafted in a way that would catch some transactions in countries that have rejected it.  There is reason to believe that its imposition, even at a modest level, would lead to the migration of funds to countries beyond those participating in it. If it were ever to be imposed on all 28 Member States, funds would migrate to New York and elsewhere. Remember: the FTT is the chosen instrument to be an EU own-resources tax.

 Mr President, I am not in favour of freedom of movement, in principle: sovereign states should be able to admit, or refuse to admit, whom they wish. When it applies between countries with widely different wage levels, it leaves the source country devoid of valuable labour and the destination country with home workers jobless.  But the problem is aggravated when third-country citizens abuse the procedure by gaining access using forged and stolen documents, sham marriages and even proxy marriages. We are told that the procedure for authenticating documents is time-consuming and troublesome. It needs to be. The British Home Secretary submitted a document showing the extent of the fraud to the Commission in December, but it is yet to be revealed to the public. The report sees freedom of movement to be not just a right, but an expectation. Those promoting it are trying to eradicate national identity and, by encouraging third-party or third-country nationals, they are seeking to eradicate the identity of Europe too.

 Madam President, the cause of homelessness, which is unmentionable by the silent conspiracy of liberal consensus, is immigration and asylum. Every person or family entering a country adds to the demand for housing by one. If there are homeless among the indigenous population, a house provided for a new arrival is a house denied to an existing resident. The decision-takers – MEPs, MPs, local councillors – are not among the homeless. Indeed, most of them cannot count any homeless among their circle of acquaintances. To them, the homeless are just statistics and not real people. Decision-takers feel terribly generous for granting a home to a newcomer, but funnily enough they do not feel mean for denying one to an existing resident. We heard this morning from UKIP that it was opposed to mass immigration. However, its leader said recently ‘we want immigration, we welcome immigration’. In 2010, he said that the UK needed 250 000 every year. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr Farage recently said that Bulgarians and Romanians were responsible for a lot of crime in London.

Mr President, the Lithuanian Presidency claims credit for progress on the Banking Union and enhanced EU control over the economies of Member States, especially those in the eurozone, as though these were simply means of achieving economic well-being. However, these are not a means to an end, but rather an end in itself: centralised control of Member States. The Presidency has boasted of its achievements on hate crime, which properly refers to criminal acts, violence, abuse and property damage motivated by hatred of a particular category of people, and should always be deplored. Hatred is always destructive of the hater as well as the hated. However, assaults and extreme violence and damage motivated by hatred and contempt are not perpetrated only – or even mainly – by the indigenous populations of Europe against ethnic minorities, as we know from the cases of Lee Rigby in London, those of Kriss Donald and Richard Everitt, the London riots in 2011 and the countless victims of Asian grooming. Lithuania boasts of hosting a conference in November of the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), which believes in the criminalisation of disapproved expressions of opinion on ethnicity, including racism – a word undefined but coined by Trotsky – and xenophobia, which can only be described as an Orwellian thought crime. Ironically, the application of these words to political opponents – a favourite activity of the FRA and Eurocrats – is a subliminal message of hatred: stop reading, stop listening, stop judging for yourself; hate the speaker, hate the writer.

 Mr President, given that national legislation is insufficient, this proposal is ostensibly to protect consumers. Yet the more you read, the more you realise that consumer protection is not wanted primarily for its own sake but because it will facilitate free trade. It seems that cutting the budget would not be acceptable. No surprise there! In the context of product safety, the report does contain some interesting revelations. In 2010, 58 % of notifications were in respect of goods from China, and in 16 % of cases it was not possible to identify the country of the manufacturer. Alarmingly, 25 % of notifications concerned toys. The drive to extend free trade worldwide without regard for the job security of Europeans is well documented. However, it seems that consumer safety has also been a victim of international free trade. The countries of Europe, individually or collectively, cannot deal with countries that habitually sell us unsafe or substandard goods. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, I am not reassured that this proposal is not protectionist, because that is exactly what it ought to be. The countries of Europe, individually or collectively, ought to protect their jobs and their businesses. The question which has not been asked is whether it is in the interests of any country or trading bloc, if you will, to open its public procurement market to other countries or blocs. Public expenditure is ultimately funded by domestic taxes, but if it generates economic activity – and it does – it should be for the benefit of that country or those countries’ own peoples. The report confirms that market access by companies from third countries is part of the common commercial policy which falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. The EU’s wish to maximise international access to these markets shows that the EU is not so much a European Union as a global union in waiting. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr Farage, you claim – or you imply – that you are against immigration. On 4 May 2010, on the Daily Politics show, you said that Britain should issue 250 000 work permits each year.

 Mr President, yes, the Commission wants to see more single market competition for defence procurement on the ground that fragmented markets create red tape and duplication of defence programmes. It is not fragmentation that leads to red tape; it is the EU requirement that defence contracts should be put out to tender.  Britain could, of course ironically, use the Lisbon Treaty to avoid tendering on the ground of protecting its national interest, as Poland has done to its great credit. The Commission will tackle what it calls market distortions, which will probably take away the rights of Member States to protect their national interest in this area. Defence is too important to the national interest to allow free market competition.  Whilst another European war is, we all hope, unthinkable, our world interests might diverge; the UK cannot be dependent for equipment procurement on states opposed, say, to our protecting the Falklands from Argentinian aggression.

Mr President, in paragraph 13 the rapporteurs express their dislike of Member States excluding themselves from treaties or legislation from the outset, and would prefer legislation to allow for derogations later. This effectively makes the default position that all treaties and legislation should apply to all Member States unless they negotiate an opt-out and only, of course, for as long as they retain it. However, the express disapproval of derogations is intended to make them an exceptional and shameful procedure for which Member States should feel properly contrite. This means that agreements and legislation concerning the euro and instruments to serve it will apply to Britain and other non-euro countries unless they and Britain ask for a derogation: in other words, control of our economy unless the government asks for an opt-out. This would allow Member State governments that are indolent, or perhaps less eurosceptic than they pretend to be, to extend the EU’s control…  (The President cut off the speaker) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, it is tempting to applaud the proposals for increasing the power of Parliament and increasing the accountability of the President of the European Council to it. Equally, it is easy to deprecate the behaviour of the European Council in trying to extend its role. If I were an enthusiast for the EU project, I would succumb to both temptations. However, I am not so I shall not. Do I look at the European Council through rose-tinted spectacles? No. My view of some of their members might involve unparliamentary language. However, whatever I think of particular members of the European Council, its members represent Member States and are ultimately responsible to their electorates and removable by them. The Parliament, whatever its merits, is not responsible to a single electorate with a consciousness of its identity so it cannot take a conscious collective decision as to the choice of Commission President. Indeed its decision will look like the decision of a Ouija board. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the general objective of the programme is to develop further mutual recognition by promoting judicial cooperation in criminal and civil matters. It all sounds rather splendid until, of course, the difficulties are examined. There are enormous differences in substantive law and trial procedure between Member States, and even within them. However, there are also differences in legal culture between the common law and continental systems, with particular reference to freedoms to act. The starting presumption in common law is that persons have the freedom to do whatever is not prohibited by law. The starting position in many continental countries is that rights are created by proclamation and can be easily defined. Whilst even in common law systems they can be defined negatively and repressively, the jury system is a safeguard against legislation and prosecutions that are considered to be unreasonable. We can see how this difference manifests itself in practice: many continental countries restrict freedom of expression in an extreme, obsessive and quite insane way. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, we have the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide but toleration of political repression at home in the EU, selective registration of European parties, party bans and attempted bans on fabricated evidence, the arrest of opposition MPs on trumped-up charges, prosecution meaning even imprisonment for heretical opinion, and even thought crime. Can democracy and human rights be implanted and nurtured even in unpromising soil? It is difficult to prevent it from being corrupted and undermined even in its ancestral home.  Countries with strong vertical divisions have difficulty in making it work. In countries with inflexible and intolerant religious ideologies, democracy can bring social repression for women and religious minorities. It is often thought that social liberalism and observance of human rights complement democracy. However, sometimes politically repressive regimes are socially liberal. There are indispensable social preconditions for democracy to develop and survive but they cannot be bought and paid for from outside. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the long-term prospects for British fishermen depend on withdrawal from the EU, but of course fishermen want solutions to current and immediate problems. We are told that the discard policy involving fish that cannot survive will of course be discontinued, but the survivability rate is said to be higher with some species. There must be research-led distinctions between treatment of different species. Avoidance of by-catch waste is a welcome theme of the Stevenson report, with adult commercial fish to be allowed onto the open market and the remaining by-catch being used for some other commercial purpose: fish meal, pet food, etc. In the end, by-catches must be reduced, possibly with gear that distinguishes between different sizes for selective catch and release, such as the pot-trap developed by my constituent Mr Jeff Stockdale in 2009. Information to consumers is always to be welcomed but the original requirements for gear type, fish stock and flag state might have been excessively costly. That the supply of this information will be voluntary is to be welcomed. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, some in my country would say that Britain in the EU is not British enough, and they would be right. But I would say that the European Union is not European enough. The immigration policies of Western Member States and the embryonic EU policy have brought third world populations to Europe and have turned parts of Europe into the third world. Identities are the product of ancestry and history, not of culture or legal contrivance. The EU does not have a European economic protectionist policy. It has a globalist policy designed to move by gradual degrees to a world economy with a common wage level and standard of living. There are genuine Europhiles, but the Eurocrats are not among them. They are cosmopolitans. Ironically, the main media-created, pretend Eurosceptic party in the UK is in favour of a quarter of a million immigrants each year and embraces globalism and global free trade.

 Mr President, agriculture is unlike any other industry because of the inelasticity of its demand and supply. That makes public-sector support absolutely indispensable. But that support ought to be Member State support and not EU support. The UK receives the smallest share of common agricultural policy funding of any Member State. The EU’s embrace of neo-liberalism opens the door to trade agreements that force Europe’s farmers to face dangerous competition. That same philosophy allows supermarkets to treat farmers as though they were their own outworkers. The multitude of farmers face the tyranny of few buyers, which is a classic example of what an economist would call an oligopsony. We have been warned about a re-nationalisation of agricultural policy. If only that were the case! What we need is abolition of the CAP, not its reform. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, money by itself does not produce intellectual inspiration. That is to be found in what a Commission 2020 document described as a ‘talented and creative populationʼ. That is Europeans, if you were wondering. Indeed, a disproportionately large number of inventions and innovations come from Europe in general, and from a country that modesty prevents me from mentioning in particular. Perhaps ensuring the survival of those talented populations from the replacement from which they are now suffering would be the best way of encouraging and nurturing inventiveness. There are some other populations in the world that have been most cruelly deprived of their fair share of those gifts. Does the public sector, preferably at Member State level, have a role to play? Historically, neither inventions nor innovations receive public funds. However, subsidies are contagious and countries and trading blocs that need to compete must match the subsidies of their rivals. Will research and development ensure that we can compete? Not if the wage levels of competitors are a fraction of our own, or if the elite talent of our competitors is to copy our innovations in breach of patent rights. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the report on the interinstitutional agreement is highly critical of the length of the negotiations within the Council and between the institutions. But the money that is the subject of negotiation is taxpayers’ money, and its expenditure must be given due consideration. The rapporteur is keen that Parliament’s legislative and budgetary powers granted by the Treaty of Lisbon should be fully respected. The report is critical of the Council for binding itself to the conclusions of the European Council.  It is true that Parliament is the only directly elected body and it seems at first sight right that it should be pre-eminent in the budgetary process. However, most of the money spent by the EU comes from or through Member States, and Member States’ governments are, in the eyes of their electorates, held responsible to their electorates for their taxpayers’ money. Parliament might be constitutionally responsible to a theoretical European electorate, but that electorate is not conscious even of its own existence as an entity. There is little dialogue between MEPs and their electors about the precise allocation of funds as distinct from the total amount.  The European Council – unlike the Council – does not have an official legislative role, but as the body representing Heads of Government its members are much more aware of the views of their citizens on expenditure than are MEPs. For as long as the EU continues they must have an important say in the negotiating process. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, this agenda is a distraction from the real causes of unemployment and the lack of growth. They include restrictive budgetary policies, cheap foreign imports from emergent economies, domestic earned income being invested abroad, and the outsourcing of jobs. But the cause of unemployment which is the real taboo is immigration, especially immigration from the Third World. Their migrants are assisted by anti-discrimination laws, while what we really need are native population preference laws, so that each country’s nationals could go to the top of the employment list. Immigration should be on the agenda as one of the causes of unemployment. In the UK, we have an establishment safety-valve party that would pretend to be opposed to mass immigration, but on 4 May 2010, its leader, Mr Farage, said that the UK should issue a quarter of a million work permits each year.

Mr President, I am sure that the High Representative will be believed when she says she wants to promote democracy and the rule of law throughout the world. I am not an enthusiast for her position, but she rightly challenges and criticises countries that imprison opposition leaders on spurious or doubtful pretexts. Of course, this does not just take place in former Soviet Republics or unstable regimes of the Middle East or Africa; it can also happen in Member States. Only a few weeks ago we saw several MP’s of Greece’s third-strongest party arrested and detained on a ‘sovietesque’ charge of founding a criminal organisation. They are not, apparently, charged with complicity in the despicable murder of a left-wing activist, but their party has been transformed into a criminal organisation over night. I know nothing directly about Golden Dawn, and I certainly do not look at them through rose-tinted spectacles. But the rule of law cannot be observed selectively. We cannot pre-judge governments and opposition (…) (the speaker was cut off by the President) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, if the EU needs to know whether the single market has been a success, it need only look at organised crime. The removal of international borders and visa-free travel make detection much less likely. The creation of a single currency could have been invented by money launderers – possibly it was. Of course, money laundering is not always obviously a cross-border activity. The UK is full of micro and small businesses which deal with cash customers and survive only by divine providence. Indeed, the hand of God – or at least one of his alternatives – must be responsible, because the tiny number of customers they have could not sustain them. The products that they sell in limited quantities are varieties of fast food and taxi rides. The trafficked products and people that they sell on a grander and more profitable scale are the products and services that dare not speak their name. Organised crime is a real problem, and this report has some merit. But it is being used to justify yet more EU centralisation and control, more harmonisation and, of course, use of the EU’s public prosecutor’s office. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, the rapporteur protests in this document that there is no protectionist aim whatsoever, as though the word ‘protectionist’ might be one of those hate labels – like ‘racist’ – that are so popular with cosmopolitans. The rapporteur is using the word ‘protectionist’ in its strict economic sense, referring to tariff and non-tariff barriers to international trade. However, if he had been using it in a more general and everyday sense, his denial would be equally valid. The EU is emphatically not trying to protect Europe’s interests, still less the interests of its Member States. The objective is to follow the World Trade Organisation’s globalist agenda. Retaliation would not be used to protect Europe’s economic interests but to enforce observance of the WTO’s globalist rules. The theory of international trade is that unrestricted trade makes the world as a whole richer. However, even if that were always the case, it would not follow that it made everybody or every country richer too. The free movement of goods and services, capital and labour – which is of course what all globalists, including EU globalists, are driving for – can only work if prices and wages are on undifferentiated scales. If that happens, the developed world, including Europe, has everything to lose. The third world and emergent economies have everything to gain.

Mr President, we have heard from the Commissioner that there ought to be respect for the rule of law in Russia, that people should not be condemned without a distinct breach of the law established by the ordinary courts. But we heard only yesterday from the Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, no less, that people accused of an undoubtedly horrific murder in Greece could be regarded as guilty before any trial. Even people perceived as being beyond the pale must be treated with respect for the rule of law.  Before we point the finger at Russia, Members of this Parliament should look into their own conduct. We have heard that Russia is restricting freedom of expression. If it is, that will be reprehensible. However, many EU Member States lock people up for expressing opinions that do not have any hint of violence. Indeed, Commissioner Reding would like to go further and criminalise thought crime. I am sure that many Members here have been speaking honesty and from the heart, but I believe that behind this debate is an agenda that has got very little to do with sexuality or freedom of expression: it is about Russia’s foreign policy.

Madam President, the loss of life among illegal migrants in the Mediterranean is of course an appalling tragedy. Improving the rapidity of response to accidents is necessary, but of course is only part of the solution. The main answer is to remove the incentive for them to travel to Europe. We must replace the policy of allowing most of these people to stay with a policy of allowing none of them to stay. When that message gets through to would-be migrants, they will stop taking the risk. Repatriation of illegals really will save lives. The architects of the EU asylum policies, including people in this House, are directly and personally responsible for deaths in the Mediterranean. They should really hang their heads in shame. The logical extension of non-refoulement is a recipe for allowing all Third World illegal migrants to stay. Of course, the real unspoken migratory policy of the EU is to cleanse ethnically the indigenous populations of Europe and replace them with people from the Third World. When that happens, parts of Europe become outposts of the Third World. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, investment, in its simplest form, is the deferral of present consumption in order to facilitate production that will enable greater enrichment in the future. If the people deferring present consumption are the ones to benefit from the future enrichment, all is well and good. However, if the deferred consumption is used to facilitate more efficient production and greater enrichment elsewhere, there has been a mismatch.  That sums up the investment relationship between European countries and China. Europe invests nearly seven times as much in China as China does in Europe. Europe is deferring current consumption to make China a more efficient producer and – of course – competitor. Most of the arguments about trade with and investment in and from China have concentrated on the level playing field argument: a removal of tariff barriers, getting China to improve working conditions, paying attention to environmental concerns and ending counterfeiting. No attention has been paid to the question of whether we should be helping a potentially enormous emerging economy to compete with the developed world for scarce resources, compete with our industries and, possibly, direct its newfound industrial wealth into even greater military capability. The West insists on being globalist – to its own detriment – when dealing with China which, whatever its lip service to Marxist rhetoric, is in fact an economic nationalist state. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, the EU has a trade deficit with Taiwan but it has a surplus in services. The UK has a substantial trade deficit with Taiwan, a ratio of almost 3:1, which has undermined and is continuing to undermine British industry. Our surplus in services is diminishing year by year. UK investment in Taiwan dwarfs Taiwan’s investment in Britain by a factor of almost 4:1. Thus British capital, deferred consumption if you like, is financing competition from Taiwan. Furthermore, that country is investing in low-wage economies in the Far East that will also compete with all of our industries.  The rapporteurs are not commending trade with Taiwan pragmatically because it benefits the EU: they commend it because it advances the WTO objective of open trade worldwide. The EU is not pursuing European objectives, but global objectives. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, MPs must not be above the law, especially if they are implicated in crimes of violence. However, the arrest of six Greek MPs, including their party leader, at the behest of the government, only days after violent protests against their party by left-wing demonstrators following the horrific stabbing of a left-wing activist, must give us cause for concern We must think of what Pastor Martin Niemöller might have said: ‘First they came for Golden Dawn, and I did not speak out because it was not my party.’ These were the first arrests of MPs in Greece since the fall of the infamous Colonels’ dictatorship in 1974. Whatever we might think of that party, no evidence has been cited of a connection between the alleged murderer and the MPs and it appears that the arrests took place to assuage the anger of violent demonstrators. I am sure that, if the Hungarian Government had imprisoned opposition MPs instead of just tinkering with the constitution, we would have held non-stop debates. Democratic rights are not to be granted or withheld at the whim of government. We must always be sceptical when governments imprison oppositions. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, we are used to the EU using the crisis as a pretext for greater integration of Member States’ economies: it is now being used as a pretext for pooling defence industries and capabilities. Apparently, surrender of the ability to take independent action is a panacea for all ills. Sovereign states that lose their own capabilities and defence industries cease to be sovereign. Supranational bodies that gain a capacity to wage war without the express consent of member countries become, by stealth, sovereign states. But of course that is the idea. The report seems to look back at previous involvement in conflicts with a degree of nostalgia and bemoans the fact that the EU does not have a clear common security and defence policy. It refers with approval to the 2008 European Council meeting at which the objective was set to be capable of deploying a force of 60 000 in 60 days. I am afraid I cannot be sanguine about the possibility of a trigger-happy EU deploying an army of that size. Alliances such as the EU mutual defence clause have the potential for transforming a localised conflict into a world war. If we doubt it, think of 1914. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, unemployment is caused by a single currency that is overvalued for the countries of the South where youth unemployment is at its highest. It is caused by high energy costs because of the EU’s mad dash for renewables. The EU’s energy costs are between twice and four times those of the United States. It is also caused by the EU’s embrace of globalisation and unlimited trade with low-wage economies. Last but not least, it is caused by unrestricted immigration.  Mr Nuttall’s hypocrisy on this was astounding. UKIP’s leader, Mr Farage, has advocated 250 000 work permits to be issued by the UK every year. UKIP is a pro-immigration party like all of the others that have expressed pretended and very recent concerns about it. Youth unemployment is particularly significant because it is even more difficult to find a new job than it is to hold on to an existing one. However, its causes and solutions are not qualitatively different. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, whilst this might not yet apply to the UK, there are issues of wider concern. The substantive content of the proposal is completely sound. Suspects should indeed enjoy access to a lawyer as well as the other rights listed. However, in my view, there is no need for EU legislation, and indeed such legislation would not satisfy the need completely. The EU is not – not yet at least – the whole world and people travelling internationally do not restrict their visits to other Member States. What is needed is not EU legislation but an international treaty encompassing as many countries as possible throughout the world, to the effect that the rights listed should apply with reciprocity to all countries that are signatories. I cannot help feeling that this proposal is not so much about the rights of the suspect, with EU legislation being the means. It is much more about extending EU legislation competence and the rights of the suspect are simply a means to an end. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, this Presidency will be even more inspired by the EU and less by the presiding country because unusually the key player will be the President rather than the Prime Minister. Why? Because the President is a former commissioner with an EU mindset. There will be more of the same: single market, banking union, neo-liberal global free trade, talk about growth and unemployment without considering the conditions for the first or the causes of the second. The Eastern Partnership is of particular interest. We are told that the politically inspired prosecution of Yulia Tymoshenko has affected relations with Ukraine. I look forward to the politically inspired prosecution of Marine Le Pen affecting relations with France.  The most important players in the EU project are invited to Bilderberg conferences. I wonder whether the Lithuanian President was invited this year. If not, why not? I think we should be told. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, there is sometimes a presumption that if we have done nothing wrong, we have nothing to fear from surveillance. However, there is evidence that security services collect political information that is not concerned with the committing of criminal offences. Sometimes they collect personal information unconnected with politics – perhaps to create leverage over individuals. Furthermore, they do not only collect information but also sometimes engage in disruptive action on the basis of that information. We know all of this from the revelations in 2011 about the activities of a British police officer, Mark Kennedy, who infiltrated Green protest groups. Some states – the United Kingdom is a particular example – practise formal and systematic discrimination against members of named political parties. A Merseyside police officer lost his career in 2009 as the result of alleged membership of a perfectly legal but heretical political party. I will stop there. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, increased mobility is not so much a cure for youth unemployment as it is a cause, at least in the West. Unemployment in the South is caused directly by a euro that is over-valued for those countries, but the European Council is determined to keep on expanding the zone. The European Council wants to improve growth and competitiveness, but the EU’s energy policy pushes up energy costs, making industry less competitive. It even provides incentives for manufacturers like Corus near Middlesbrough to move production to India. Immigration – two thirds of it from outside the EU in the case of the UK – is giving our jobs to people from outside. Increasing globalism will make industry in the EU try unsuccessfully to compete with emergent economies. The European Council does not so much have a cure for the recession, it is part of the problem. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the authors of this report seem not to appreciate the irony of their calls for restrictions on freedom of speech in protection of fundamental rights. To justify themselves, they use the emotive term ‘hate speech’. Hatred is an ugly word because it is an ugly concept.  We know from the experience of France how low the threshold can be. The mere careless choice of words, such as ‘detail’ or ‘debate’, can land you in court. The FN presidential candidate in 2012 is now being prosecuted for drawing parallels between military and migratory occupation. Has Hungary, under the present government, prosecuted any opposition, presidential or other candidates? Has Hungary banned any political parties, as Belgium did in 2004? Has it attempted to ban a political party using evidence fabricated by the security services, as Germany did in 2001? Has Hungary, under the present government, acted like its predecessor in 2006 and sent armed police to attack peaceful demonstrators? Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, bonuses awarded in the fund management sector are certainly high. It is difficult to justify them morally and it is always tempting to want to do something about them. I am certainly tempted to do so. But we have got to look at this rationally. A restriction on bonuses would inevitably lead to compensatory increases in basic income. That would be worse because, of course, basic salaries – unlike bonuses – cannot easily be reduced to reflect poor performance. Should we then restrict incomes in basic salaries? Well we could, but then we should logically say that perhaps we ought to limit all people’s salaries. Do we really want the EU – or even Member States for that matter – to have that kind of power?  The real problem which needs to be addressed is the high level of expense ratios of investment funds – the amount paid by investors to the funds. In the United States, equity funds charge an average of 0.64%; in Europe most funds charge over 1%. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the implementation of the Compact for Jobs and Growth is to be discussed. If only words were deeds, if only wishes were achievements. The impact of tight budgetary constraint was to be monitored, but it did not act on what it saw. You cannot make a population richer by making it poorer. It promised to promote growth and competitiveness. How do the high-wage economies of Europe compete with the slave-labour wages of the so-called ‘emergent economies’? How do countries with an over-valued currency that cannot be changed unilaterally become more competitive without devaluation?  The single market is seen as a panacea for all ills, but it has facilitated the export of jobs from higher-wage economies to lower-wage economies. Improving training for the unemployed will make individuals better able to compete with their fellows. It might also marginally improve the efficiency of industry and commerce. However, it will not increase the total number of jobs immediately.  Mr Barroso believes confidence is a key to growth. It will be effective only if that confidence is soundly based. However, investors can see that the EU’s embrace of the ideology of globalism will destroy European industry and reward the emergent economies, and they will invest accordingly. Individuals might prefer to invest in their own countries, but their investment funds are, unfortunately, profit maximisers. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, paragraph 12 of the motion for a resolution says that freedom of expression – even if it offends – is at the heart of democracy. I agree absolutely. Physical attacks on peaceful demonstrators should certainly bring Turkey’s application to the EU to a complete halt. We could also mention the attempted prosecution of Mr Orhan Pamuk for a heretical view of Turkish history – but of course, France attempted to enact an almost exact mirror image or converse of that law under which Mr Pamuk was prosecuted. Many other EU countries prosecute and imprison people for heretical, historical or political opinion. The Belgian Government of Mr Verhofstadt actually banned a political party – Vlaams Blok – and Germany tried to ban a party with fabricated evidence. Turkey certainly deserves censure, but EU Member States must put their own houses in order first. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, asylum has got far less to do with shielding people from persecution, and much more to do with serving as a pretext for facilitating immigration.  The political class knows that there is opposition to mass immigration, so they present asylum as a system over which they have no control. If applicants are not detained or allowed to seek work, they will also need housing. Jobs and houses are in short supply, so they will be employed or housed at the expense of the home populations. Perhaps complicit MEPs should open their homes to these applicants and fund them from their salaries, rather than letting the poor and dispossessed bear the burden.  Of course if asylum is refused, the applicant will be given a piece of paper asking them to leave, but there will be no coercion. They can also use the legal system to frustrate removal. An Iranian asylum seeker, Mr Rostami, came to Britain in 2001 and was refused asylum in 2002. He is still in Britain after several appeals, a prison sentence and a deportation order.

Mr President, the solution to these problems, we are told, is more EU legislation and greater competence for the EU. Unlike the literary character Topsy, organised crime did not just grow: it has been facilitated by the EU. Schengen removed borders for organised crime just as it did for legitimate business. Drugs, arms and trafficked people can be more easily moved. A single currency makes it possible to launder the profits of crime much more easily anywhere in the zone, just as lax immigration controls and connivance with bogus asylum claims allow criminals and sometimes their wares to pass from one country and one continent to another.  Of course, not all organised crime involves crossing frontiers. The predominance of the same distinct population groups both in ostensibly legitimate cash business such as taxi firms and take-away food shops, and in drug dealing and prostitution, allows the profits of the latter to be laundered through the former.

Madam President, the substance of this proposal has every merit. People who have been subjected to domestic or other violence or harassment need to be protected wherever they happen to be – their home country, another EU Member State or, for that matter, anywhere in the world. I would be happier with a worldwide treaty to which all well-meaning countries would freely subscribe, recognising protection orders from other countries. To have EU legislation suggests that people move between countries only within the EU. I do not favour EU legislation on principle, but I do accept that it is better for vulnerable people to be partially protected in a form that I do not favour than not to be protected at all. I do not want to facilitate movement of people in the EU, but I do want them to be protected when they do move. Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that sometimes, behind this apparently well-meaning legislation, some people are more interested in the extension of EU legislative competence than they are in the substantive issue.

Madam President, the appalling problem of the millions of external and internal refugees cannot be considered in isolation. Their difficulties will only be overcome when the conflict comes to an end. The problem is, of course, that neither side seems likely to win decisively in the foreseeable future. The conflict is often depicted as being one between incontrovertible good – the opposition – and incontrovertible evil – the Government. In fact, both sides have committed hideous atrocities. The Government is politically repressive but socially secular. Some of the opposition are – or claim to be – both politically and socially liberal. Others, the Islamists, are neither, and they certainly are not secular. Their regime would be more oppressive than Assad’s Syria. The answer is not to provide arms to either side, and it is not to bring the population to neighbouring countries or to Europe. The answer is for the whole international community to urge talks between government and opposition without preconditions – except, of course, for a ceasefire. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, I congratulate Bosnia and Herzegovina on making little progress towards meeting the political criteria. The more resistance a country shows to the EU, the better, in my opinion. In particular it has resisted the move towards a neo-liberal market economy as distinct from simply a private enterprise economy. Apparently, too, little progress has been made towards freedom of movement, for which I might be inclined to congratulate them – until I discovered they are referring to freedom of movement within Bosnia and Herzegovina. If you are a Croat or a Bosniac, you might think twice about travelling through some parts of the Republic of Srpska. There is a coded reference to there being no shared vision. What this means is that the population is split three ways and political cooperation is minimal. Would it really be desirable to bring such a divided country into the EU? There is of course a lesson for us. A vertically-divided state is ungovernable, as Swedes in Stockholm must be concluding at this very moment. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, it is the Member States that have the responsibility to collect taxes and fight fraud, yet here the EU is trying to extend its legislative competence. It is obviously true that fraud is often committed across international borders, often by the multinationals that are so beloved by the EU’s neo-liberal policies. But ‘borders’ means all borders, and not just the borders of Member States. Action needs to be by extensive international agreement and not confined to the EU. On another subject, to talk about growth, jobs and competitiveness in the context of the EU’s energy policy is wildly optimistic. Renewable energy might well be a desirable ideal, but it is inefficient and expensive. High energy costs will not create growth, jobs and competitiveness, they will destroy them. Suppliers of energy wishing to use fossil fuels are penalised financially, and those plants will eventually be closed down. To make matters worse, emergent countries seem to be immune from strictures against the use of fossil fuels. In the UK we have vast quantities of oil locked in the ground as the result of Mrs Thatcher’s policies in the 1980s. We must discard our prejudices against fossil fuels and against nuclear energy. They will be the key to growth and jobs. The difficulty facing the eurozone will doubtless come up. Perhaps they might heed the words of Oscar Lafontaine and begin an orderly dismantling of the eurozone. Only escape from the eurozone will rescue the troubled economies of the South from permanent stagnation. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, the terms ‘pro-European’ and ‘anti-European’ are often used as shorthand for ‘pro-EU’ and ‘anti-EU’. I for one find the use of the term ‘anti-European’ to describe those of us who are opposed to EU membership, or even the existence of the EU, as highly offensive. Europe is much older and much more than the EU; it is a cultural entity, a religious entity and an entity with overlapping and related ancestries. The EU goes out of its way to welcome third-world immigration and embraces the political and economic doctrine of globalism. It is the EU that is anti-European because its policies will eventually destroy the distinctiveness of Europe. If third-world immigrants come to Europe they do not become new Europeans to replace unborn European babies, they turn parts of Europe irreversibly into the third world. It is global capitalism and the related political ideologies that fuel immigration because it regards human beings as though they were merely facts of production. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, thank you. Twenty-two years ago, Croatia fought for and eventually won its independence, for which it paid with the lives of many of its nationals. That independence has now been surrendered to the European Union. To add insult to injury, Croatia has had to pay to be allowed to surrender. Part of this price was handing over two of its generals, Generals Markac and Gotovina, to the UN War Crimes Tribunal so that they could be stigmatised – quite unjustly, as it turns out – as war criminals. Croatia is praised in the report for its democratic consolidation. Let us hope that democracy is contagious and that it spreads to the EU and its worst Member States. Croatia has been told that it must respect the rights of minorities. If some Croats have problems with minorities at present, then, in the words of Al Jolson: ‘you ain’t seen nothin’ yet’. Wait until the poor of Africa and Asia, admitted by the EU through its common immigration policy, turn up in your towns and cities and outnumber your tiny population. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, Turkey certainly abuses human rights when it prosecutes academics for expressing opinions, such as describing the 1915 killing of Armenians as genocide. Of course Turkey is not alone. France proposes an exact mirror image of that law. People will be prosecuted for saying that it was not genocide. France and many other Member States prosecute and jail people for heretical opinions, so perhaps Turkey might fit in after all. I am not an enthusiast for the European Union, but for as long as it exists, I prefer it to be more European rather than less European. Turkey is not European by its geography, ancestry, religion or culture. Whilst not being an EU enthusiast, I really find it extraordinary that a country that is still occupying nearly 40% of Cyprus should even be considered for membership. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the Prime Minister’s statement was preceded by a speech on 26 March. He spoke of the uniqueness of Europe’s regional integration being based on supposed common values. The EU talks about democracy and freedom of expression, but then it and its Member States seek to jail people for exercising that right. The values for which the EU is most enthusiastic are those of social liberalism; consensus values only amongst social liberals. He then revealed that regional integration was on the agenda all over the world. He might have said it was on the same agenda drawn up by the same people. What will this regional integration achieve? It will promote trade and remove barriers to trade not only within each region, but between regions. In that trade, Europe must be competitive, we are told. He implied strongly that labour costs would have to be curbed or even lowered. (The President cut off the speaker) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, the eurozone and the ECB are not a solution to the difficulties of the European Union; they are part of the problem. During the early years of the eurozone, northern Europe needed low interest rates to improve its growth. However, those low interest rates caused a property boom in Spain. When that boom came to an end, the banks found that they had insufficient security for their loans. In 2011, the ECB conducted two distinct and contradictory interest rate policies. The answer is that a common interest rate, like a common currency value, cannot be appropriate for 17 different economies. The report suggests that there ought to be wage increases in the north of the EU in order to stimulate aggregate demand in the south. However, would you encourage employers to increase wages above the market rate? They will certainly not be encouraged to do so when there is a plentiful supply of labour resulting from an open-door policy on immigration, nor will they do so when they have the freedom to export jobs to the Far East by relocating industry. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, unemployment is not falling, and is unlikely to do so in 2013. The value of the euro will not allow the countries of the south to emerge from recession. Austerity programmes will not cure unemployment. You do not make countries richer by making them poorer. Globalisation might make the emergent economies richer, but it will make European countries poorer. The single market might help low income Member States, but only at the expense of higher income Member States.  Uncontrolled immigration will make unemployment even worse. We heard earlier from a Mr Farage about immigration. Is that the same Mr Farage who said in 2010, on 4 May, that the UK ought to issue a quarter of a million work permits each year? Incidentally, the Romanian citizens he was referring to were not ordinary Romanians, they were Roma. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, Syria is, of course, anything but a democracy, but not many countries in the Middle East are, including of course its fiercest critic, Saudi Arabia. Nor for that matter are all of Mr Assad’s opponents in Syria democrats.  The Syrian government’s handling of the protest was, from the beginning, grossly disproportionate, but its brutality has sometimes been matched by the opposition. We can judge a regime also by its substantive policies. Before the conflict, women were relatively liberated in Syria. Religious minorities, particularly Christians, were free to worship without interference, although, of course, some Christians have been attacked by Islamist members of the opposition.  It is all very well to bemoan the huge humanitarian toll of the conflict, but that is what happens when neither side is capable of winning decisively. It is also what happens when the protagonists are armed, albeit covertly, by outsiders.  How long will it be before the armed forces of Member States are dragged into the conflict and body bags start to be flown home to Europe? How ethical was it, and is it, for the West to encourage other people to risk their lives to advance the West’s political agenda: that is, depriving Iran of an ally and Israel of an adversary? Was regime change really worth 70 000 lives?  The priority now must be to bring the bloodshed to an end. That can happen only when there are talks, without preconditions, on neutral territory.

 Madam President, dispute resolutions are self-evidently beneficial. Most disputes with retailers over goods and services would not be worth taking to court, which means, of course, that consumer complaints would not be considered and unscrupulous traders would take advantage of this. Of course, of the various forms of ADR, arbitration is undoubtedly the best, because at least it guarantees an early conclusion.  I have a greater problem with the underlying motive for these measures. It is not primarily to improve consumer rights, but to facilitate online cross-border trade in manufactured goods. This will undoubtedly affect adversely the manufacturing sectors of the higher wage economies of the West and the retail sectors of the West.  Nevertheless, they will benefit consumers buying products at home as well as abroad. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Violence and incitement to violence must of course be recognised as thoroughly despicable criminal acts. However, it appears that racism and xenophobia go beyond violence. Can you define these terms?

Mr President, so Mali is going to be on the agenda. All actions have consequences, some of them unintended as well as those that are planned. Those who are disposed to learn from past mistakes will recall that Britain’s war against the appalling regime in Afghanistan, and our ill-founded war against Iraq, resulted in the London bombings by third-generation Islamists from a large fifth column in Britain. The political leaders of France, Britain and the rest will not be thanked by the families of service personnel killed in this conflict or by the families of victims of retaliatory atrocities in Europe, which will be the direct result of this perceived incursion into Muslim territory. Of course the atrocities in Europe are facilitated by a large Muslim and significant Islamist population in the cities of Western Europe. Even those like the opportunists from whom we heard yesterday, who find it expedient to oppose this latest adventure, refuse to see the presence of fifth columns in Europe as the threat they undoubtedly are. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, of course British withdrawal from the EU and the recovery of exclusive use of our waters would solve the problem, but in the mean time any attempt to improve the common fisheries policy must be welcomed. Ending the practice of discarding dead and dying fish back into the sea is self-evidently right. The practice must be ended, whether it involves under-sized fish that have been caught accidentally, or less valuable fish that are discarded to make way for more valuable fish, so-called ‘high-grading’. Of course, enforcement with regard to the latter practice might be rather difficult.  Enabling Member States to enact their own conservation measures within a 12-nautical-mile zone is clearly desirable, but the Member State must be able to enforce that against other Member States. The rapporteur’s proposal that fishing concessions should cease to be freely transferable is particularly good. It would stop concessions from being bought and sold, and the concessions would remain the property of each Member State.  Successful policymaking is dependent on accurate supporting information. It has been estimated that stocks of 70% of the species caught in the EU have not been assessed accurately. The report particularly does not fully address the problem of incompatibility between the conservation of fish stocks and the survival of fishing industries. The only solution is for countries that have provided the bulk of the fish stock to be given priority in their own waters. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, the year begins with unjustified optimism about growth prospects, but that recedes as the year’s realities begin to emerge. If you persuade countries to share a currency that is over-valued for some of them, if you import manufactured goods from countries of low wages and inhuman conditions and tolerate the transfer of production and investment to emergent economies, you will not get growth, you will get recession. If you import cheap labour from poorer countries, you will not get increased employment of our own nationals, you will increase unemployment. We have unsatisfied needs in our economies and unemployed people who could satisfy them. What is physically possible must be politically and financially possible or the political and financial systems are not fit for purpose. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, whilst I am not an enthusiast for the European Union, if we must have it, I prefer it to be more European rather than less European. These negotiations between the EU and Mercosur – and many other trading associations – show that the EU is not exclusively, or even mainly, focused on Europe. It is globalist. It has the ambitions that all cosmopolitans and neo-liberals have, of a borderless, undifferentiated world in which goods, services and people will move without let or hindrance.  The result of this is not only that eventually all distinctive peoples and therefore cultures will disappear, but that all wage rates and standards of living will approximate to the same level – which would not be the level that modern Europeans enjoy. The theory of international trade is that the world as a whole will be richer as the result of comparative advantage. However, it is not necessarily true that each country or continent, or each social group and sector, will also be richer. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Madam President, we have heard a lot about the priorities of the Irish Presidency, including improving economic growth and creating jobs. Of course neither is very likely at all with the euro being grossly overvalued for many of the southern European countries and the EU’s disastrous embrace of globalisation, neo-liberal economics and austerity measures.   Of course these and other priorities were not initiated by Ireland any more than Cyprus’s priorities were devised by that country. The Irish Foreign Minister let the cat out of the bag on 12 January: he said, “Today’s meeting helped to build on 18 months of Presidency preparations in close contact with the Commission”. It is all an elaborate delusion in which the rotating presidency provides a sort of demographic or democratic legitimacy to the programme of the unelected Commission. The President of the Council presides over a meeting of Member State representantives with an agenda provided for it from outside. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Madam President, I found the Cypriot President’s New Year’s Eve message refreshingly honest, as far as it went. He admitted that the policies implemented on a pan-European level had not succeeded in providing a solution to the crisis. He could, of course, have gone further and said that, if southern European countries in the eurozone were to revert to their own currencies, each being left to find its own value, those countries would enjoy export-led recoveries. He could have said that EU countries – individually or collectively – should protect their industries from imports from the so-called emergent economies. Earlier in December 2012, he did explain that the impasse on the Cyprus problem had been caused by Turkey, which used the Cyprus Presidency as an excuse. He might have added that the EU, for all its talk of solidarity, appears not to regard the Turkish occupation of Northern Cyprus and the desecration of its Christian places of worship as an impediment to talks on Turkey becoming a member.

Mr President, this report makes many valuable proposals about how companies ought to respond to restructuring. It is self-evidently right that workers should receive the maximum notice of redundancies and of course receive improved opportunities for re-employment. However, recital AC states, quite rightly, that different companies, sectors and countries have different needs, so I think Member State legislation would be more appropriate than EU legislation. There is one glaring flaw in the report. It treats the need for restructuring as though it were an autonomous need over which neither the EU nor Member States had any control. Recommendation 1 mentions the need for companies to be competitive. The question is with whom or what and why? The answer is twofold: relatively low labour costs within the EU and peripheral countries in Europe and much lower labour costs and appalling working conditions in the Third World and the so-called emergent economies. The unspoken cause of the need for restructuring is the process of globalisation which all the countries have signed up to. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, Mr Donskis is quite rightly concerned about selective justice under the guise of the rule of law, but of course only in new and transitional democracies.  In a number of EU Member States it is possible to be jailed for stating one’s views on immigration or expressing an opinion on academic subjects. Honest tyrannies that admit expressly to jailing people for being opponents are rare indeed. Nearly all tyrannies inside and outside the EU pretend that they are adhering to the rule of law but in fact they have passed laws which are tailor-made for their political opponents. France is probably the worst culprit in the EU, where the incautious choice of a word, detail or debate might lead to prosecution, as might the posing of an unfavoured analogy or comparison between events. Ms Le Pen is the latest victim of such a prosecution. Such countries are not so much democracies as gulags or prison camps. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, I am in principle opposed to all EU legislation but, other things being equal, I prefer that legislation to be in the form of a directive rather than the form of a regulation, which of course is self-enacting. The content of the 1996 Groundhandling Directive was bad enough because it resulted in an increase in short-term contracts and greater use of new staff. This has led to a fall in wage levels. The proposed regulation would bring about further liberalisation. This might look good from an accountant’s perspective, but the jobs involved include aircraft maintenance, cargo handling and dealing with passengers, encompassing security checks.  Is it really desirable to jeopardise safety, security and handling of valuables to transient staff without continuity of service? Liberalisation in this sphere, as in every other, is a recipe for oppressive working conditions, wage cuts and a lower standard of service. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 Mr President, the report talks of the liberalisation of trade, investment and public tendering leading to mutual benefit. Trade liberalisation is, of course, a euphemism for globalisation, which actually leads to mutual detriment. The European Union will export its industrial technology to Central America, or possibly even relocate its manufacturing there, employing cheaper labour working in inferior conditions.  Cheap, duty-free goods will flow into the EU, jeopardising profits, wages and jobs in Member States. These are already in deep recession, with rising government debt. The report boasts of the expansion of the quantity and range of goods that will be tariff-free. The commitment to public tendering will allow multinationals based in the EU to swallow up public procurement contracts in Central America. This agreement, like globalisation – of which it is a part – is not for the benefit of ordinary people there or here, but in the interests of multinational corporations.

Mr President, we are used to hearing supporters of the EU project saying that we need more economic union, not less – not a sentiment I agree with. But I would say that the European Union is not European enough, and has become wedded to the political and economic ideology of globalism. The report refers with approval to the EU document of 2006 entitled ‘Global Europe’. This agreement, like many similar ones, removes virtually all tariff and non-tariff barriers after a transitional period. The EU is moving slowly but surely towards a world free of tariffs, a situation in which all living standards in the world will gravitate to the same level. The EU is sailing under a false flag. It is not a European Union, but a global union. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

Mr President, human trafficking does not need to involve the crossing of national frontiers or even travel within a country. According to the UN it includes ‘recruiting people by deception for exploitation for prostitution’ – what we in Britain call ‘grooming’. British police and politicians were for years frightened to act for fear of being called racists. When my colleagues on Bradford Metropolitan Council in 2006 proposed a motion urging action against grooming, all the other councillors and parties voted against it. Those councillors included the present Conservative MP for Keighley, who is belatedly trying to exploit the issue. Whilst nationalists came to the rescue of British adolescents, all of the other parties walked by on the other side. When my former colleague, an MEP for the North-West, tried to draw public attention to the issue, the police and CPS tried unsuccessfully to prosecute him for incitement.

– Mr President, the real problem is all manufactured imports from, and all relocations to, China and other emerging economies. Indeed, the problem lies with ourselves, or rather with yourselves – addicted to neo-liberalism and the economic and political ideology of globalism. I will let you into a secret. China might have transformed itself into a capitalist economy and country but it is not neo-liberal. It competes with us with artificially depressed wage levels, which not only reduce costs, but also prevent the development of a market for imports from the West. Flagrant patent violations, 19th century working conditions, cheap state loans and subsidies and a grossly under-valued currency. In the meanwhile, they are stock-piling resources and Western currencies. If you think that global companies originating in the West are on our side, remember they are eagerly relocating where the costs are lowest and the conditions worst. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

– Mr President, there are several distinct questions apart from the obvious one of asking whether the EU should exist to spend any money at all. Is it spending money on the right things and the right recipients? Should it be the EU, as distinct from Member States, that spends that money? There are some items on which I would be happy for no money to be spent at all: the Year of the Citizen or the resettlement of economic migrants posing as asylum seekers. There are other targets of expenditure which are perfectly proper, such as the support for industry or agriculture, but in these cases the function ought to be exercised by Member States. How much should each country pay and how much should each receive? The EU does not advertise itself as an instrument for the redistribution of income and wealth as an end in itself, although it does precisely that, in the name of social cohesion. Fellow nationals of a Member State have a sufficiently shared identity to regard the pooling of resources and support as perfectly justifiable. However, the pooling of resources and support further afield is often a stimulus for resentment and even aggression – not exactly what the EU would like to produce, which is social cohesion.

– Mr President, (inaudible)
 … austerity programmes do anything but aggravate a country’s problems of unemployment and debt. However, if people in various Member States are suffering because of those programmes, it seems a contradiction that a supranational body of which their country is a member should be asking for an increase in spending. It seems a contradiction, that is, if the country is a net contributor. Perhaps net recipients are less worried by that contradiction. Britain has always been a net contributor, which is why a previous prime minister negotiated the British rebate. Those who are now seeking to reduce our rebate by recalculating it want us to be even more of a net contributor. The UK might achieve a freeze on spending but still increase its net contribution. The British rebate is not money paid into a begging bowl held by a richer-than-average – and therefore undeserving – country; it represents the return of part of an excess of contributions over receipts.

 Mr President, ‘economic and monetary union is not an end in itself’, says the report. Quite right: it is an instrument to achieve political union. The report claims that it will achieve sustainable growth and a high level of employment, but it admits that unemployment in the 27 has risen by 50% from 2008 to 2012. In those countries for which the euro is overvalued, mass unemployment and negative growth are directly attributable to euro area membership. If they were to leave the zone they would experience export-led growth and a fall in their unemployment. The euro-led recession in the South has not left the North unscathed. Its exports to the South have been reduced severely. More control and austerity measures will not reduce debt. They will reduce employment and profits, which will cut government revenue. This will lead to more debt rather than less debt. Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

 – Mr President, this is an unusual example of the EU recognising a real problem which does need to be addressed internationally, though not necessarily by the EU. The problem with passing a law which prohibits people from purchasing something is that, the longer the process takes, the greater the chance of the purchasers – in this case would-be terrorists – stockpiling the items in advance of the ban. I can remember this proposal first being mentioned in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs at least a year ago, possibly longer than that, and of course we do not know when the legislation is likely to be passed and come into effect. I think it would have been preferable, initially, to agree internationally to enlist the support of the industry in adopting a voluntary code of practice, and then to encourage all countries, including Member States, to pass legislation without delay. In the UK, for example, it is possible in certain circumstances to pass a law within 24 hours. The procedure in the European Parliament is so long and detailed that it is likely that would-be offenders will already have stockpiled before the legislation is enforced.

 Mr President, the report is not so much a piece of economic reasoning as a tautology. More integration is seen as necessary to achieve more integration. Coordination is not an answer to unemployment but is seen as an end in itself; it is not so much a cure for unemployment as displacement activity for those without a cure. The answer to the problems of the South is not austerity, which produces only more unemployment. It does not even do what is written on the tin, which is reducing debt. Most of the countries of Europe need reflation without inflation. We must remember that what is physically possible must be financially possible, or there is something wrong with the financial system. We need to see an abandonment of the euro experiment and southern countries released to enjoy export-led booms. We must reject globalism, protect and recreate our industries and reject the coded references in this report to wage cuts and worsened economic conditions. We must not drive down our wages and conditions... (The President cut off the speaker) Andrew Henry William Brons  (NI

– Madam President, the Commission’s priorities are directed towards greater integration as an end in itself and not towards measures that will solve the real economic problems facing the populations of Europe. The greatest of course is the recession, with its unemployment and under-employment, squeezed incomes and reduced benefits. Indeed, the austerity programme is calculated to produce unemployment and not to combat it. One policy area mentioned is genuine economic and monetary union: the euro, with its common external value that is hideously overvalued for the countries of the South, and which is aggravating and perpetuating the recession for them. Another Commission priority is said to be to use EU resources to improve competitiveness. Well, countries with overvalued currencies cannot compete even with other countries in their region. The EU’s embrace of globalism means that European manufacturers have to compete with emergent economies with pirated designs, workers on artificially depressed wages and slave-labour conditions.

 Madam President, yet again we vote on a report full of insane sabre-rattling against undemocratic Russia but, as the nominations deadline for the EU elections approached for Italy yesterday, the police force of your occupation government arrested dozens of Forza Nuova activists, imprisoning them without any justification ...

 Mr President, the plight of minorities and refugees in Syria is indeed terrible, but who have they fled from? I went to Syria twice last summer and wrote the letter that the Syrian Government sent to help sway the UK Parliament’s vote against a bombing campaign that would have killed and displaced even more innocent victims. While I was there, I met Christian, Alawite and Muslim refugees. I can tell you that huge numbers of them have been forced from their homes by the same Jihadi rebel terrorists that the EU has done so much to help. If you really care about the people of Syria, you should insist that the CIA and Zionist warmongers stop arming their Jihadi mercenaries and you should impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia and Qatar for funding the invasion of Syria by the thousands of Islamist cut-throats from whom so many Shia, Christians, Alawites and moderate Sunnis have had to flee for their lives. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, we all agree that the Communist regime in North Korea is an undemocratic shame. What are we to make of a regime that jails its opponents on trumped-up charges and keeps them in prison, even when the political motivation for it is tape-recorded and exposed? What are we to make of a regime that claims to hold free and fair elections, but then arrests its opponents to stop them collecting and delivering the 300[nbsp ]000 signatures they need to stand? If it happened in North Korea you would rightly condemn it, but the victims in my first example are Greeks, and in my second, Italians. Because the systematic police repression of Forza Nuova activists has happened there in the last 24 hours. So stop whining about North Korea, as it is totally hypocritical unless you also stand for the right of European electors to choose Golden Dawn or Forza Nuova if they so wish. You have no power at all to change North Korea, vile though the Communist regime there undoubtedly is, but you could order your backyard occupation puppet regimes to restore democracy in Greece and Italy this afternoon. People in glass houses should not throw stones. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, what is the main aspect of EU foreign policy? To help the USA meddle around the world in places that have nothing to do with us – Iraq, Serbia, Libya, Afghanistan, Syria. You have acted as cheerleaders for aggressive neo-con interference which has benefited only radical Islamists but has destroyed societies, while costing British taxpayers billions of pounds. Now the target is Russia.  Members know full well that the so-called Ukrainian revolution was manufactured with everything from the agitprop to the snipers provided from the USA and the EU. We all know the root of the tough Russian reaction is aggressive NATO expansionism, first into Poland, next into Ukraine. Yet you persist in irresponsible sabre-rattling in someone else’s natural sphere of influence. It is said that in 1914, Europe sleepwalked into war. This time you are heading there with eyes wide open. The basic choice is war or peace. You seem hell-bent on war, so remember: whatever excuses you manufacture, plotting an aggressive war is itself a crime. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr[nbsp ]President, when the godfather of the European Union, Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, published the plan for a united Europe and the ethnocide of the peoples of Europe, the encouragement of mass non-white immigration was central to the plot. Since then, an unholy alliance of leftists, capitalists and Zionist supremacists has schemed to promote immigration and miscegenation with the deliberate aim of breeding us out of existence in our homelands. As indigenous resistance to this human genetic-modification industry grows, the criminal elite seeks new ways to camouflage their project. First, their immigrant pawns were temporary guest workers; then it was a multiracial experiment; then they were refugees, and then the answer to a shrinking population. Different excuses, different lies – and asylum is just another one. But the real aim stays the same: the biggest genocide in human history, the final solution to the Christian European problem. This crime demands a new set of Nuremberg trials, and you people will be in the dock. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nick Griffin  (NI

 It is you who are shouting because, obviously, the truth hurts. Yes, I will be seeking re-election. Yes, I hope to return here to speak up for the indigenous Europeans which the founder of this place has deliberately set out to wipe out – because that is a crime. I am telling the truth. I have a constructive suggestion to help those poor asylum seekers from Africa. Yes, make it clear they cannot come here so they do not try to cross the sea and drown in huge numbers. The best way for them is to get the banks off the backs of their countries so that they can live in peace in their countries and we Europeans can live in peace in ours. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Madam President, unlike the others in this debate I have gone twice to war-torn Syria to see at first hand what is really going on there. So I can tell you that the majority of the refugees do not want or need to come to Europe. They just want the West to leave the Syrian army to finish off the Islamist terror gangs from whom the Christians, Alawites and moderate Sunnis fled for their lives. Then they will be able to go home.  The Wahhabi minority should go to their Gulf State sponsors, where they too would be at home. I can also tell you that, having used the CIA to help the rebels destroy so much of Syria, American and French corporations are already in contact with Damascus to negotiate multi-billion-dollar reconstruction contracts. While the EU and Mr Farage unite to import a wave of violently Islamist asylum seekers to already poor and stressed parts of our constituencies, American and French companies are chasing profits for big business, as usual.

Madam President, Prime Minister, 2014 is supposed to be the year of democracy in Europe, but what kind of democracy tears up its own constitution, bans demonstrations to prove the people are happy, sends machine gun-toting storm-troopers to arrest democratically elected MPs and imprisons opponents without trial when they cannot disprove hearsay allegations made against them by police informers? Totalitarians like you always justify such attacks on freedom with propaganda lies about criminal association but, Mr Samaras, your bankers’ occupation government – now busy helping your masters loot Greece – are the real criminals. You are the heir of the communists who refused to fight when your country was invaded by Mussolini, when Metaxas said ‘no’ and fought foreign occupation and exploitation – which is of course the real crime of its modern political descendants, Golden Dawn. Nick Griffin  (NI

Mr President, there is all this fuss over the activities of an unelected pressure group which was warned in advance not to invade the waters of a sovereign nation and break legitimate laws. No Russian citizen has ever voted for Greenpeace. They have no democratic mandate whatsoever. So imagine how much bigger the fuss would be if Russia launched a totally illegal assault on a legitimately-elected political party. Imagine if the Russian Government were to use the excuse of waves of lies from a controlled mass media to arrest the leaders of the opposition. Imagine if President Putin were to tear up the constitutional rights of democratically-elected parliamentarians and spit in the face of a growing body of opinion of up to 20 % of voters. We would never hear the end of it, and rightly so. But when these things happen in Greece, you hypocrites either say nothing or actively applaud the repression. No one ever voted for Greenpeace, but half a million Greek voters have been disenfranchised by the attempted murder of Golden Dawn at the behest of EU bureaucrats, German bankers and Zionist gangsters. This looters’ coup against the Greek people by the puppets of the privatisation criminals is a thousand times more important than this artificial hysteria on behalf of an unelected, unrepresentative group of watermelon-green cranks.

Mr President, having spoken in Damascus with many relatives of victims of the Islamist war on Syria, I hope that we all welcome the Russian proposal to put chemical weapons beyond use, without an escalation of the conflict. We should do everything possible to help this diplomacy to succeed, because if it falters Obama, Hollande, Cameron and the other neo-con puppets will drag us into a conflict that is certain to spiral out of control. Obama claims there will be no boots on the ground. That is a lie, because if the US bombs Syria into the clutches of al-Qa’ida, then Syria’s chemical weapon stockpile will end up in the hands not of the United Nations decommissioning teams, but of the heirs of Osama bin Laden. American, British and European troops will then have to be sent in to try and secure those weapons, and our soldiers will die in Syria in order to stop children dying in Islamist poison gas attacks, not just in Damascus but in Paris, London and New York. That is why we should turn the Russian peace proposal into reality. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, I recently spent four days in Damascus, a city that is striking for its normality and religious tolerance. Contrary to the propaganda about repression, Sunni mosques are open and some women wear clothing which shows the Salafist sympathies of their husbands. Others wear mini-skirts. It is a secular society much like ours. I also met captured free-Syria army rebels not only from North Africa and Central Asia, but also from France and Spain. They spoke freely about their aim, once they were done in Syria, to bring their bloody jihad to Europe – to London, Paris, Madrid, Stockholm and Manchester. At least 600 EU-born Islamists are fighting with the rebels. If you send arms to Syria, they will go to men who will bring them back here and turn them against us. If you arm the rebels, you will not just help these cut-throats destroy the last tolerant secular state in the Middle East, you will also bring Wahabi terror to our streets. Stop and think before you plunge your hands in so much innocent blood. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, tonight several hundred more British old-age pensioners will freeze to death. Why? Because of fuel poverty. Because carbon profiteers, wind farm wide-boys and left-wing broadcast media like the BBC have conned and bullied and bribed MPs and MEPs into believing – or pretending to believe – that man-made global warming is going to destroy the world. This modern version of an ancient religious fantasy is being used as an excuse for the biggest corporate scam in human history. Carbon taxes make fortunes for the super rich while old Mrs Smith shivers to death. Tonight, while out-of-touch politicians waffle on about unattainable targets that will de-industrialise Europe, real people are dying one by one. There is a legal term for what the political elite are doing here: corporate manslaughter. Nick Griffin  (NI

Madam President, when we discuss violence against women, there is a desperate attempt to avoid mentioning the giant green elephant in our midst: Islam. Islam’s inherent devaluing of women and hostility to unbelievers combine to make it the greatest threat to millions of women and girls in many parts of the EU. In Britain, the crime of on-street grooming for sex, drugs and prostitution is directed against thousands of girls as young as 10. Many of the victims are beaten, threatened and gang-raped. While the majority community produces many perpetrators of internet paedophilia and one-on-one sex crimes, paedophile gang rape is a crime in which the perpetrators are overwhelmingly Muslim, while their innocent victims are invariably from other communities.  In my constituency, 14-year-old Charlene Downes was groomed, raped and murdered. Her body has never been found. The case against two Muslim men collapsed on a technicality; however, while the police say that they are not looking for anyone else, they continue to ignore evidence of jury rigging and refuse to seek a retrial. Charlene’s mother and grandmother are bravely and actively campaigning for justice. Shockingly, this has resulted in both of them being repeatedly threatened with arrest for involvement in entirely peaceful protests. The problem of officialdom turning a blind eye to the inconvenient truth about Islam and sexual violence is thus endemic. I urge those here who are concerned about this issue to face the politically-incorrect truth, because denial will not make the problem go away. Justice for Charlene Downs!

 Madam President, while the people on that side of the House are denying the facts, thousands more young girls will suffer as a direct consequence of your denial. Of course Islam is directly involved. When you have a religion which says that a woman’s rights in court are half those of a man, when you have a religion which says that a woman who is raped can be stoned to death for adultery unless she can produce four male witnesses to prove she is innocent, then of course that creates a mentality within that community which is fundamentally anti-women.  It started with Muhammad, who raped a captive – a Jewish captive – whose husband he just had murdered. He started that, and he is regarded by Muslims as the perfect man. His example colours what Muslims do. Many Muslims do not, but within their community this is real problem. You need to recognise that fact and address it, not run away from it. Nick Griffin  (NI

You say your heart beats strongly for women raped in India – mine does, too – but does your heart not also beat for the thousands of young girls gang-raped in Britain over the last few years, or are you simply left in ignorance because the facts are concealed by the controlled liberal media?

 Mr President, this is a depressing but predictable report: the persecution of hundreds of thousands of Christians, one and a half million refugees, broken infrastructure, murderous sectarian militias, daily bombings and shootings, child prostitution, honour killings, female genital mutilation and brutal Islamist repression of women. It is good to see the EU, albeit indirectly, admit that Western meddling in Iraq has led to disaster. It would be even better if the cheerleaders for the illegal war of 2003 that created this shambles were to apologise and learn from their terrible error. It is utterly hypocritical for members of the globalist elite to shed crocodile tears over the collapse of Iraq while at the same time striving to replicate it in Syria. Just as in Iraq, so the fall of Assad would lead not to Syria becoming a replica Switzerland, but to its collapse into bloody anarchy and the triumph of Wahhabi fundamentalism. This meddling has already helped kill hundreds of thousands in Iraq. It is time for a little humility and to leave Syria to the Syrians. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, I was an international observer in the Ukraine elections. I had unrestricted access in Kiev to polling stations, election officials and party activists.  I have seen corrupt elections where gangs of thugs sponsored by the prime minister attack opposition activists; where council workers are threatened with losing their jobs if they vote the wrong way on ballot papers that carry traceable serial marks; where two million voters do not even exist but still vote by post; where, at the close of polls, unsealed ballot boxes are taken to central counting places by unsupervised officials; where the election officials are appointed by the local ruling party. But all these assaults on democracy go on routinely in the United Kingdom. In Ukraine I saw a robust and well-designed system, ensuring elections which, while not perfect, are much freer and fairer than those in Britain. EU hypocrites do not have any right to criticise Ukrainian elections. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Madam President, the fracking debate is full of deceit by those who stand to profit from shale gas or who see it as a weapon in neocon hostility to Russia. We are told that most fracking in the USA is by small and medium-sized enterprises, yet few real SMEs have the capital or technology for fracking. What looked like SMEs are in fact limited liability fronts for giant corporations. They exist solely to spare the parent companies the huge cost of eventual clean-up operations, which will therefore fall on the taxpayers. The game is simple: loot, pollute and scoot. Claims of massive job creation are lies too. The Public Policy Institute of New York State claimed that 500 new wells per year would produce 62 000 jobs, yet a review by Food and Water Watch showed that the true figure is fewer than 7 000, scarcely one tenth of the promised boom. In every part of the USA where shale gas is exploited, house prices crash by 25%, with environmental devastation from hundreds of platforms and huge, poisoned slurry ponds. The longer-term threat to water supplies could be even more costly. Gas fracking is short-termist, boom-and-bust exploitation. Yes, it produces energy, but so would burning all our forests. It makes no sense except to lobbyists and politicians in the pay of the companies doing the looting. The answer to the energy crunch is not short-term fracking but long-term, safe, sustainable nuclear power and electricity- and hydrogen-fuelled transport systems. That is the energy economy of the future. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Madam President, the voluntary system proposed would have very little effect on Britain because the British system is already very effective. But I have heard from a number of constituents who are concerned that anything involved in the transportation of live animals can, in the end, be used to facilitate the transport of animals for slaughter over a long distance. This is something that is clearly unnecessary in an era of modern refrigeration, and which needs to be phased out. On the question of labelling, the great concern of everyone concerned with animal welfare is that all meat originating from animals suffering ritual slaughter should be labelled: consumers have the right to know and to reject it.

– Mr President, in May, President Barroso bragged of the EU and its Member States throwing EUR 1.2 billion a year down the Afghan drain. But EUR 1.2 billion is only a fraction of the true cost. Britain’s contribution alone to the Afghan farce, according to the British Ministry of Defence, is already over GBP 18 billion, plus GBP 3 billion in aid, plus GBP 4 billion in equipment that is to be left behind, plus GBP 5 billion that will be screwed out of the British taxpayer to run Afghanistan for a further 30 years. Most importantly, 417 British dead are the highest price of all and the most obscene, because it is a war that has nothing to do with Britain. We should bring our troops home at once and put the neo-con crooks who sent them there on trial as war criminals. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, no decent human being can feel anything other than deep sympathy for young men who leave their families and risk death in overcrowded boats in order to reach a new land of milk and honey. But why do they do it? Who is responsible for luring these poor people into so much disappointment and even danger? The politicians. Because every time the political class insists on giving one batch of immigrants the houses, taxes and jobs that belong to the long-suffering natives in Manchester or Malmö or Brussels or Birmingham, you incite another boatload to risk their lives to get to the promised land and be given other peoples’ milk and honey. Three simple rules would end the immigration crisis. One: no jobs for immigrants while our own people face mass unemployment. Two: if a greedy boss is caught employing illegal labour, the business should be confiscated. Three: if you have not paid in, you do not get a house or a penny in benefits. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, it would be easy to mock this report. Indeed, it is being laughed at by millions of British voters reading their papers this morning. Coming at a time when the euro disaster is breaking nations and driving desperate people to suicide, this staggering exercise in politically correct sloganising could – had it been on the agenda at the start of this month – easily have been mistaken for an April Fool’s joke. But in truth, this attempt to institutionalise discrimination and contempt against half the population of Europe is not a laughing matter. Men and women are conceived to complement each other for the common good. This proposal is an attempt to sow discord between the sexes, break family values and export EU Frankfurt School poison worldwide, using the excuse of climate change. Such incitement to gender-based contempt, division and hate is not a victimless crime. Hundreds of thousands of men are denied access to their children after bitter divorces. Thousands of children are snatched by the state because the crucial importance of fathers and loving, united families is denied and undermined by militant feminism of the sort that underlies this report. Meanwhile, there are real problems out there hurting real people. Voters expect us at least to try to solve them, not to waste our time and their money on sexist anti-male, anti-family gibberish. Ladies and gentlemen, please, let us drop this empty, bigoted sloganising and work together to deal with real problems. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, be careful what you wish for because you may get it. This old saying is very true about reducing our use of hydrocarbons. By 2050 we will have a low-carbon economy for the simple reason that we will largely have run out of carbon. All the increases in non-conventional hydrocarbons, including from environmentally catastrophic shale oil and gas fracking, are only just about keeping up with the worldwide decline of conventional oil production. The long emergency of peak oil has begun. Those who think we can deal with it by building wind farms and eating nut cutlets may mean well, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. The biggest threat is to food production. In agriculture, before the age of oil, for every calorie of energy invested by man, horse or ox, the average return was one-and-a-half calories. On that small surplus our ancestors built their cathedrals, painted their Rembrandts and wrote their Rights of Man. Oil-based agriculture uses far fewer people to produce far more food. Its ratio is twenty-to-one. That is an input of 20 calories of oil energy for machinery, fertilisers and pesticides for every calorie of food produced. Today’s globalised world is a house of cards, built on the suicidally-unsustainable use of finite fossilised sunlight. This is the real carbon crisis which we need to address. If we continue to fail to do so, today’s children will look back in despair at all the time and energy that our generation wasted trying to kill the wrong pig. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, as an observer in Moscow at the Duma elections, I witnessed a robust system which is far more democratic than the fraud-ridden shambles in Britain. If observers come to elections in London this May, they will find hundreds of thousands of non-existent ghosts voting by post without any kind of ID check. They will see flimsy cardboard ballot boxes with voting papers falling out of gaps at the bottom, mainly under the control of appointees of Baroness Ashton’s Labour Party. At least the Russians have elections. Baroness Ashton became one of the most powerful figures in post-democratic Europe without a single vote. And who elected the technocrats now asset-stripping occupied Greece and Italy? We all know the real reasons for the attacks on Putin. George Soros and his banker friends want to privatise and loot Russia just like they are looting the West. So forget about the specks of dust in Mr Putin’s eye and remove the giant planks of electoral fraud and elite greed from the European Union’s. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, I can start by saying that Mr Bové’s report is so comprehensive that it is difficult to add anything to the excellent job he has done. But I will point out that, with agricultural wages in Morocco at an average of just five euros a day, trade liberalisation can only add to the desperate plight of farmers in Greece, Sicily and Spain. It is madness for the EU to give preferential treatment to big business concerns exploiting the Maghreb while its banking elite force murderous poverty on hard-working people in our own back yard. Since not even the most crazed global-warmist still claims that we will soon be growing olives in Lancashire or oranges in Kent, it follows that we will have to continue to import such produce. Let us do so from our hard-pressed fellow Europeans in Greece, Italy, France, Portugal and Spain. Leave the farmland of Morocco to support farming families in Morocco, rather than helping international agri-business swallow it all up and spit the human wreckage out at our shores as destitute and angry Islamist refugees. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, on weapons of mass destruction, one should remember how politicians and media liars queued up to demand action against Iraq over WMDs. That propaganda lie justified sanctions and an illegal war. MEPs who voted for sanctions against Iraq over those non-existent WMDs might have meant well, but they helped to murder hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children, who died through lack of food and medicine. Now it is nuclear weapons of mass destruction. It is a new target, Iran, but the main victims will be the same – children – because a successful oil and banking embargo would make it impossible for Iran to buy enough food and medicine for its population. If the EU votes for sanctions it exposes itself as bankrupt – not merely financially, but morally too. If Saudi Wahabis and Zionist neo-Cons want war with Iran, that is their business, but it is not ours, and we should stay out of it.

 Mr President, I am no friend of Iran. I am very critical of Islam and all things Islamic, and the Islamic threat to Europe. But, as regards the Middle East, that is the affair of the countries of the Middle East. It is not for us to interfere. When the Iranians look at what happened to Libya – which did not have effective weapons – you really cannot blame them for wanting to defend themselves, if that is what they are doing. As for weapons of mass destruction, however, we have heard the lies before and I think we are hearing the lies again. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, in discussing Durban, the most obvious question is whether an agreement last year to reach an agreement in three years’ time to do something in eight years’ time is really an agreement at all. Likewise, one has to ask whether the agreement to create a green climate fund and transfer USD 1 billion a year from hard-pressed taxpayers in countries like Britain to corrupt third world oligarchies reflects a serious threat of global communism or a happily unattainable fantasy. Given the way in which EU Commissioners are forcing economically suicidal spending cuts on the protectorates of Greece and Italy – a move likely to spark a chain-reaction implosion of the entire financial system – the fantasy answer is fortunately the more realistic. But the most significant thing about Durban is what was not discussed: climate science. This is no surprise, as it is now crystal clear that the so-called scientific consensus on man-made global warming simply does not exist. It is not just a matter of the thousands of independent scientists who dispute the whole theory: even the warmists themselves now admit that the computer models on which the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) cult is based are simplistic and flawed. The more they learn about feedback mechanisms and the complexity of real climate, the more they realise they do not know. To crucify our taxpayers and de-industrialise our economies in pursuit of the one-world government madness of the United Nations is therefore crazy. Hence the failure of 10 000 well-meaning tax-eaters to agree anything serious in Durban is to be warmly applauded. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, when there is a stench of death and decay in your house, there is no point complaining about the neighbour’s drains or arguing about which air freshener to try next. The first thing to do is to admit that the real problem is the rotting corpse of the dead elephant in the living room. It is absurd to speak of economic governance while ignoring the root cause of the debt crisis that is dragging Europe, and indeed the world, down to economic disaster. The thing that is rotten is the fiat money banking system. A system that allows the banks to create credit out of nothing and lend it into circulation as interest-bearing debt; a system that makes bankers the masters of the universe, instead of the servants of productive industry. A system that leads to poverty, division and war. The first step to long-term economic stability is to put an end to the international bankers’ swindle and restore the power to create credit to sovereign national governments. This is the only way out of the crisis; the way to prosperity and peace. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Madam President, my constituency is suffering a hidden epidemic of sexual grooming so I appreciate the efforts of all those involved in producing this report. The grassroots campaigners for the protection of children tell me that the report misses the most important target. To concentrate on online pornography while relegating real-life child sexual abuse to a page 33 annex is to worry about a speck in one eye while ignoring a splintered plank in another. Real-life abuse is described in the report as ‘offline grooming’. Such terminology is an insult to the victims and their families. It is not offline: it is on our streets. It is not a matter of images: it is a matter of real-life degradation, gang rape, and even murder. But because a disproportionately large number of street groomers are Muslims, politically-correct censorship prevents the issue from being properly discussed. Because of this deliberate downplaying of the problem, on-street grooming is not even a specific offence in many countries. As a result, the crime remains statistically virtually invisible. This undermines attempts to secure justice for the victims, effective responses from the authorities, and proper penalties for the perpetrators. In my own constituency, the family of Charlene Downs still waits for justice following the botched prosecution of those arrested over the grooming, rape and murder of their little girl in 2003. Despite their belief that 60 other girls had been groomed by the same gang, and that Charlene’s body was disposed of in kebabs, the police regarded their report as too sensitive to publish. The consequences of such cowardice became clear four years later when 15-year-old Paige Chivers went missing, believed murdered, at the hands of the same gang. Of course, not all police officers are politically correct cowards, any more than all Muslims are groomers. The vast majority are as sickened by these things as we are, but the playing down of the problem in reports like this aids the criminal minority and leaves new victims at risk. The more serious crimes should get the attention. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, for some years now climate realists like me have struggled to understand what lies behind the man-made global warming hoax which will be further exploited at Rio+20. Various theories have been put forward. Post-1989, it gave the far left a new stick with which to beat the West. Maurice Strong and the United Nations saw it as a way of promoting one-world government. It has handed carbon traders and wind factory profiteers a taxpayer-funded blank cheque. But none of the above explains the hitherto puzzling role of big oil and neo-con foundations in funding the environmentalist protest groups which have led the climate-change and anti-nuclear propaganda offensives. Now, however, their real agenda is coming to light. Phoney green hysteria has blocked the potential for nuclear and coal electricity to power our civilisation in the post-peak oil world. This gap allows those who will profit from gas fracking to say that we have no choice but to exploit this environmentally disastrous energy source. Of course we have no choice, because their useful idiot Greens have denied us the other alternatives. So now we face a fracking gold rush in, among other targets, Lancashire, Wales, southern England, France and Poland, where George Soros has just won an almost exclusive licence to loot and pollute almost the entire country. The neo-cons and globalists are also excited about the potential of fracked gas to advance their geopolitical agenda of reducing the influence of Russia and destabilising the Arab world. Climate change never was about drowning polar bears. It was always about big business profit and elite power. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, EUR 1 billion every year: that is the amount of taxpayers’ money that the Commission and Member States give to the Palestinian Authority. EUR 1 billion a year to a corrupt regime that does very little for its own people, while ordinary voters in our countries are crushed by rising taxes and inflation. It is unreal. Worse than that, EU policy is based on the false concept that a two-state solution is workable. It might have been once, but it is too late now. The Palestinians are geographically dispersed: over two million live east of the 1947 armistice lines, a million in Gaza, and about a million in Israel. In the Occupied Territories, the illegal Zionist settlement programme has sliced their land into disjointed parcels. Even if all the territories conquered in 1967 were included, Palestine would still be only 22% of the territory of the current Greater Israel. It would be an economic basket case, forever reliant on foreign aid handouts. The two-state solution sounds pretty, but it is simply not realistic. Yet again, the EU is throwing money away on a policy doomed to failure. We must accept that we cannot solve every problem in the world. We should turn our attention and money to solving our own. Let us face it: thanks to the euro disaster, this place is not going to run out of problems. EU meddling in the Holy Land is not only stealing money from overtaxed British families; combined with even more massive US aid for Israel it encourages both sides to refuse to get serious about sorting out their own differences. None of it helps real people. It is a counterproductive waste of EUR 1 billion a year. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, my voters and my party are overwhelmingly sceptical about GM crops. Like the majority of voters in every country of Europe, we reject technology imposed for the profit of giant multinationals without safeguards or consent. We reject technology that will replace sustainable local family farming with short-sighted international agri-business. Where we part company with the Commission is over the way in which the Europhiles, as always, are seeking to exploit such genuine concerns and real problems by pushing for federal European solutions. This report, giving back a little power to nation-states, is a welcome exception. But, in the long term, if the people of Britain want to secure the freedom to reject Frankenstein foods, they will not get it by bowing to the European project. They will only get it when they reject the rule of the corrupt Westminster political elite and their big business puppet masters, because it is that out-of-touch greedy elite which is forcing upon us both Frankenstein foods and the Frankenstein monster that is the European Union. Our voters demand the freedom to reject both in free and fair referendums. The Westminster elite is not only allowing reckless multinationals to genetically modify our food, their mass immigration policy is also genetically modifying the entire British population, just as your utopian multiculturalism is destroying traditional identities all over Europe. This is why, both in Westminster and Strasbourg, we the people have to get rid of the elites before the elites get rid of us. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, first it was cucumbers, yesterday it was bean sprouts. Today, it is not bean sprouts. The truth is that the experts just do not know, but each time such allegations are made, they destroy livelihoods in countries’ economies. What we do know is that there is something very strange about this outbreak. There is an unnatural combination of strains and DNA in the virus. It is affecting unusual groups of people in a way not normally associated with E coli outbreaks. It has already struck far more people and in far more places than a normal outbreak and, unlike in normal outbreaks, it has not been rapidly traced to one or two food suppliers. Given all these inexplicable factors and the fact that various countries – including Britain, the USA, Iraq and Israel – have, in the past, been reported as experimenting with genetically manipulated E coli as a biological weapon, should there not be an urgent inquiry into the possibility that this outbreak is, in fact, an instance of, and perhaps a test run for, biological terrorism?

– Mr President, I have to echo Mr Chichester’s earlier intervention. We are being given by our interpreters the choice to vote ‘no’ after you have said ‘Εγκρίνεται’ [‘Adopted’].

 I voted to oppose the removal of the Parliamentary immunity of Bruno Gollnisch because: 1. Free speech is a core value of our society and the cornerstone of our democracy. It should not be curtailed by political opponents. The comments attributed to Mr Gollnisch were not incitements to violence and were not abusive or insulting. The comments were about the intolerance of Islamist regimes towards Unbelievers. 2. No debate was allowed before the votes on this issue, which affect the fundamental rights of an MEP. 3. The proposal to lift Bruno Gollnisch’s immunity (and the politically motivated decision to lift it) were inconsistent with the proposal to allow the German MEP Elmar Brok to retain his immunity from prosecution for an (alleged) greed offence of tax evasion. It is clear that the prosecution is a vexatious one, by a private organisation, designed to deprive Mr Gollnisch of his elected position and his good name. It is equally clear that, in the increasingly intolerant atmosphere of Political Correctness that is permeating the Parliament, some MEPs are more equal than others. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, the explosion at Chernobyl was a disaster, but let us keep it in perspective: 64 people were killed by Chernobyl radiation over 23 years, and it caused an unknown proportion of 6000 cases of thyroid cancer. These are tragic figures but they pale into insignificance compared to the death toll on our roads. Yet, while no one is using road traffic accidents to campaign to ban the motor car, a small army of leftists is using Chernobyl to push for an end to nuclear power. I do not doubt that they mean well but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. The same people meant well when they helped to create the biofuels rush, pushing the price of food beyond the reach of the world’s poor. Tonight millions of children will go to bed slowly dying of hunger because people on that side of the House meant well: that is what the fuzzy ideals of the Utopian left do in the real world. The impact of a nuclear ban would be even worse because the alternative to nuclear power is not wind farms and solar panels. In our energy-scarce, post-peak oil world, the alternative to reactors is mass starvation. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, as is so common here, this debate has little connection to reality and none whatsoever to democracy. Most here talk as though Iceland being sucked into the Euro black hole is a done deal. But that is not the message coming from Icelanders. Current opinion polls show that those who wish to keep their independence outnumber the Euro-Quislings and Europhiles nearly two to one. Seventy-five percent of Icelanders wisely do not trust the EU. The only Icelandic party in favour of membership has slumped from 30% to 18% in the polls. It is the same all over Europe. While the political elite move to ever closer union and federal empire, the people want freedom and independence. Such mismatches are the seedbed of revolution. Congratulate yourselves on accession progress all you like, but the coming financial meltdown in the countries being crushed in your Euro straightjacket will be costly to us all, but fatal to your Utopia. Iceland, and the nations now stuck in your raspberry Reich, will be free at last. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, as I hear discussions on ways to screw more money out of the little people in the name of climate change, I am struck by two things. The first is how no one talks about global warming anymore. Even the most out-of-touch MEPs have clearly realised that exposés of fraudulent pseudoscience and record cold winters across the globe have made the public, rightly, very sceptical about all the deceitful propaganda about drowning polar bears. The second is the car park beneath us – Porches, Mercedes, BMWs, SUVs, a showroom of gas-guzzling luxury from the people who tut-tut in disapproval at many white vans and plot to make working lives even harder with speed limiters and financial penalties, all for a dogma based on discredited statistics pedalled by a clique of bought and paid-for academics, funded and hyped by super-rich vested interests in the green industrial complex – Al Gore, Prince Charles, Shell and Goldman Sachs – all of whom stand to steal a fortune from the taxes harvested through wind factory subsidies and carbon trading. While I appreciate the efforts of some MEPs to blunt the worst excesses of this CO2
 hysteria, the plain truth is that anyone who even gives credence to the threadbare hoax of man-made global warming is a collaborator with the deadliest scam in history. Yes, deadly, because it is not only robbing ordinary people and de-industrialising the West; it is also right now starving to death hundreds of thousands of the world’s poorest children as food crops are replaced by taxpayer-subsidised biofuels. But it is boosting profits for Monsanto and giving MEPs all expenses paid trips to palm oil plantations in Malaysia, so that is all right is it not? No, it is not, particularly as it is diverting attention from the real crisis – not that we are releasing carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, but that we are beginning to run low on the oil which powers our civilisation. Every day wasted talking about limiting emissions of nature’s most important fertiliser is a day lost in the struggle to sustain more and more people on less and less energy. If it was not such a tragedy, it would be a farce. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, I do not know if the House noticed, but yesterday was also the record snowfall in Korea for 100 years, so it is not just a few places. Just as it was two years ago in Copenhagen, when the climate change conference was there, it was the coldest at the climate change conference in Cancún that it had been for decades. Secondly, there is no evidence whatsoever of meltwater from the Arctic impeding the Gulf Stream. There has been no change in that whatsoever. Thirdly, your arguments would be more effective if the climate change computer models had foreseen this a couple of years ago. They did not. A couple of years ago, we were told that our children would not know what snow was. What an absolute nonsense this has been. Finally, as for the statistics showing a global warming trend, the key factor everyone is ignoring here is that 65% of the world’s weather stations are within 10 metres of an artificial heat source. They are virtually all in cities. The collapse of the Soviet Union meant that most of the weather stations in naturally cold areas were closed down. That is what has skewed the statistics, which are fundamentally bogus because people, boosted by the United Nations, set about finding man-made global warming in order to impose the solutions they wanted.

 Madam President, a young woman in my constituency has this morning, as every weekday morning at this time, just returned home from walking her two young children to school. Jenny used to drive them there but she can no longer afford to put petrol in the car for anything other than her twice-weekly trip to the cheapest supermarket in her part of Manchester. This morning, as every morning, Jenny is hungry because she has a choice for breakfast: either she eats or her two little girls eat. There is not enough bread and jam for all of them. Meanwhile, here on planet EU, MEPs discuss tweaks to a financial instrument that involves the spending of EUR 1.1 billion of taxpayers’ money on promoting democracy and human rights, mainly in the third world. Most of those tweaks further reduce the oversight the nation states have, as the Commission burns its way through vast amounts of British taxpayers’ money. What a waste and what hypocrisy to bang on about women’s rights in Africa when thousands of Jennies cannot even feed their kids properly. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Madam President, this report demolishes the lies of the British political class about the Afghan War. I do not know the names of any of the innocent Afghan victims of this wicked war, but I do know that it has nothing to do with British interests. And I know the names of the 18 brave young men from my constituency who paid with their lives for this madness in the last year alone. Corporal Simon Hornby, Liverpool; Warrant Officer David Markland, Lancashire; Kingsman Sean Dawson, Stalybridge; Corporal Harvey Holmes, Hyde; Corporal Terry Webster, Chester; Lance Corporal Andrew Breeze, Manchester; Marine Steven Birdsall, Warrington; Marine Paul Warren, Preston; Sergeant Steven Darbyshire, Wigan; Private Alex Isaac, Wirral; Private Douglas Halliday, Wallasey; Colour Sergeant Martyn Horton, Runcorn; Private Thomas Sephton, Warrington; Sergeant David Monkhouse, Cumbria; Sapper Darren Foster, Carlisle; Lance Corporal Jordan Bancroft, Burnley; Kingsman Darren Deady, Bolton; Guardsman Christopher Davies, St Helens. What a criminal waste of brave young lives! It is, of course, no business of the European Union what wars Britain should or should not fight. That is for the British people and our elected representatives in our House of Parliament in Westminster to decide, just as it will be for us to decide one happy day to put Messrs Blair, Brown and Cameron on trial for war crimes, because Afghanistan, just like Iraq, is a criminal war.

– Mr President, as carbon crooks and One World Government conspirators celebrate their advances at Cancún, UK Prime Minister Dave Cameron declared his satisfaction with the outcome. At the end of the coldest first half of December in central England since records began in 1772, Dave is satisfied that the Green Climate Fund will cost British taxpayers GBP 2.9 billion on top of the GBP 18.3 billion a year that the Climate Change Act siphons from British consumers for the corporate crooks in the green industrial complex. Coincidently, GBP 2.9 billion is also the amount the Treasury will save by increasing the debts of British students, condemning them to a lifetime of bondage to the banks. That scam has already caused student riots. Taxpayer riots over far bigger scams – bail-outs to corrupt and incompetent banks, propping up the zombie euro and the global warming hoax – are yet to come, but come they will and, unlike Prince Charles and Camilla, their targets will deserve everything they get. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, I should like to say to the Commissioner that the new energy strategy report ignores the elephant in the living room: peak oil. But at least the Commission has at last woken up to this gigantic and immediate threat. The moment one recognises peak oil, the majority of this largely well-meaning report becomes, sadly, incinerator fuel. The huge energy gap opening up cannot possibly be filled by Mickey Mouse renewables or shale carbons. Coal, nuclear fusion – and in the long term nuclear fusion plus fission – are the only energy sources dense enough to save us as the oil age comes to an end. Commissioner, now that this has been recognised, can we look forward to a new, serious approach to energy? We must ditch all the nonsense about wind-power grids and global warming and concentrate on real scientific solutions to the peak oil crisis. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, choosing sunny Mexico for COP 16 was a good move. We should be spared a repeat of last year’s embarrassment, when global warmists shivered in the coldest Copenhagen December for decades. Likewise, using the deceitfully ambiguous term ‘climate change’ rather than ‘global warming’ may blind a few British taxpayers to the irony of holding it just as an unusually cold summer gives way to an early, icy winter. An even better trick would be to hold these events only in the spring: look, it is getting warmer every day. How much longer can the fascistic EU impose ever more punitive taxes and controls on ordinary citizens on the pretext of man-made global warming, when an ever-increasing number of real scientists are rejecting the theory as unfounded and demolished? AGW is baseless propaganda, a Josef Goebbels-scale big lie from the green industrial complex because they favour massive transfers of wealth from the little people to carbon-trading crooks, such as Al Gore and Goldman Sachs. And it is being exploited by leftist political elites to complete the deindustrialisation of the west because spineless conservatives are too browbeaten by global warming hysteria to stand up and tell the really inconvenient truth: man-made climate change is the most profitable con trick in history. This year’s Bilderberg conference, held in Spain in June, included a session on the dangers of global cooling. When will the new realism of the people who really shape global politics creep in here, among the people who merely think they do? Andrew Henry William Brons and Nick Griffin  (NI

– We abstained on the Bilbao Barandica, Gallagher and Ferreira reports on the grounds that they contained beneficial and harmful proposals in the same instrument. However, we voted in favour of the Gróbarczyk report, despite having misgivings about some of its content (e.g. its suggestion that the discard system might have worked well for certain species of fish – we are opposed to the discard system completely). We voted in favour of it because it promised a review of the discard system. This is about as much as we can hope for within the confines of the common fisheries policy. Nick Griffin  (NI
).  
– Mr President, it is good that the EU is trying to preserve endangered fish stocks, but before there is too much self-congratulation on these proposals, we must remember that many past EU fishing rules have been appalling failures. Britain’s home waters have been fished to near extinction under European fisheries policies. The reality is that the protection of fish stocks is best left to local fishermen and national government marine scientists, not EU bureaucrats. The advice from the men working in the broken remnants of Britain’s fishing fleets is simple: scrap quota systems, which lead to discards and high grading, and replace them with weight-based catch limits so that all fish caught are landed for human consumption or for processing into animal and fish feed. We need to replace the system of openly tradeable quotas and so stop financiers, supermarkets and the super rich from speculating in fishermen’s livelihoods. Quotas of all kinds – and in whichever seas – should be owned by fishermen from ports with traditional connections to those waters and be tradeable only between fishermen who are likewise entitled to fish by personal, family and community connections. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, before taking advice from any expert it is wise to examine their record to check that they are competent. The Integrated Maritime Policy report is partly the work of the Committee on Fisheries, so before buying into its grand schemes it is worthwhile taking a critical look at the European Union’s record on the management of the seas. Inevitably, this means assessing the situation in the former sovereign UK waters, secretly betrayed to European bureaucracy control in 1973, since nearly 70% of so-called ‘EU fishing stocks’ are actually British fishing stocks. How have our fish and our fishermen fared under the common fisheries policy (CFP)? The figures tell us far more than all the fine words in this report. 88% of the EU’s stocks are overfished, against a global average of about 27%. 30% of our fish species are now officially outside safe biological limits, because there are too few adult fish left for normal reproduction. Under the CFP’s obscene quota system, nearly a million tonnes of fish are discarded dead into the North Sea alone every year. Meanwhile, the industrial hoovering-up of species such as sand eels has led to crashing populations of bird species such as puffins. To Europe’s south, the picture is just as bad. West African fishermen, whose lifestyle had been sustained for generations, are being forced to switch to people trafficking because EU-registered vessels have helped fish their waters to extinction. It is time for the EU to acknowledge that its record in maritime management is the worst in the entire world, a typical example of what is known as the tragedy of the commons – the phenomenon by which shared resources always get exploited ruthlessly, because anyone who exercises restraint is disadvantaged by the unscrupulous. It is time to restore control of the seas and fishing grounds to the sovereign nations, whose track record has shown them fit to exercise such stewardship. In the case of the two-thirds of EU waters that the EU has fished to extinction, that means the British nation and British fishermen. Nick Griffin  (NI
).  
– Mr President, as is so often the case with EU proposals, these financial instruments include measures which have great emotional appeal. All decent people like us want to stop drug smuggling, people trafficking and the supply of small arms to conflict zones, but it is very easy to be emotional and generous with other people’s money. Thus, while ordinary people in Greece, France, Ireland and Great Britain are having their societies ripped apart by cuts and their backs broken by taxes, the Scholz report will add EUR 176 million to the EUR 172 million already committed to help third-world capitalists gobble up even more of our jobs. The Goerens report will blow EUR 190 million, including EUR 17.4 million for a facility for rapid response to soaring food prices in developing countries. It may have escaped your attention, but food prices are soaring in our constituencies as well. Worst of all, however, is the Brantner report. Here, on page nine, it speaks of a financial envelope of EUR 2 062 billion by 2013. This is, of course, a misprint. I hope to God it is a misprint, but the fact that such a ridiculous error could slip past all the experts and MEPs who have read this report speaks volumes for the careless abandon with which the European Union spends money. This money does not grow on trees. It is not handed out by a giant tooth fairy. It is not the Commission’s money; it is not MEPs’ money. It is taxpayers’ money and a hugely disproportionate amount of it is British taxpayers’ money. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Madam President, the real significance of the Deepwater disaster is being missed. The real question is why BP is drilling for oil through 5 000 metres of rock, in water 1 500 metres deep, in the middle of a hurricane zone. The answer is peak oil – the point at which we have used the half of the world’s reserves that were easy, safe and cheap to produce, and now rely on shrinking reserves which are increasingly inaccessible, dangerous and expensive, both financially and environmentally. Deepwater is merely a symptom of peak oil. Using it as an excuse for yet another EU power grab will not stop us reaching peak or suffering its potentially catastrophic consequences. Instead of talking about symptoms, it is time to get serious about the disease: the fact that we have used all the easy oil and are still addicted to the stuff. In recent months, this reality has begun to dawn on – among others – President Obama, the British Government and the German military. It is time for the EU to take its head out of the sand, stop obsessing about climate change, and study and address the real crisis: peak oil. Nick Griffin  (NI

Mr President, the prospect of being jailed for thought crimes is shocking. Unlike most of the people here, I can tell you that from personal experience. The British Government has tried to jail me three times under anti-free-speech laws that state that telling the truth is no defence. So I am very sympathetic to Chinese, and especially Tibetan, dissidents forced into slave labour in Communist prison camps. Steps must be taken to prevent the goods they make being allowed to undercut manufacturing and workers in the West. But, if one accepts that items made by forced labour constitute unfair competition, it is impossible to avoid the same conclusion about goods made by sweated labour, by workers who are not allowed to organise into trade unions in a country where there are no environmental protection costs. The truth is that all manufactured goods from China constitute unfair competition. Trade with China, far from being free, costs millions of jobs and destroys our manufacturing base. It is time to protect our workers from this unholy alliance of Communist tyranny and capitalist greed. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, lawyers chase ambulances: where there is an accident, there is a parasite rushing in to profit from someone’s misfortune. The advocates of European Union are ambulance-chasers extraordinaire: from the fantasy of man-made global warming, to earthquakes and forest fires, every crisis becomes an excuse to grab even more power. The Russia-Ukraine gas crisis was an artificial problem caused by neo-con interference in the politics of Eastern Europe. The answer is to stop ‘baiting the bear’ and to leave the nations of Europe free to buy the gas that Russia needs to sell us. Instead, the crisis is used as an excuse for the EU to seize control of gas supplies and ensnare us all in a web of interdependence designed to enforce the Union that voters would never approve. This is not about gas supplies. It is the creeping tyranny of a Socialist superstate using deceit to grab what it cannot get democratically. When it drops the mask of reasonable necessity, its new fascism will be imposed, not with castor oil, but with deadly cold. That is why freedom lovers will vote against this report. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Madam President, the defining feature of the EU conspiracy, apart from endemic waste and fraud, is that it rides roughshod over the wishes of real people. The push to bully Iceland into surrendering to EU rule is an example. Gallup polls reveal that 60% of Icelanders want to retain their freedom by staying out of the EU. Only 26% are now fooled by the pro-Union propaganda of the corporate media. This is no surprise. Icelanders have the oldest tradition of true democracy in the world. They do not want to exchange it for rule by unelected commissars. Icelanders have some of the last great fish stocks in the world. They want to preserve them from being destroyed, as EU membership has destroyed Britain’s fish stocks. Icelanders are proud of their Viking origins, vibrant culture and identity. EU rule would doom Reykjavik to becoming a scale model of the Muslim ghettos of ‘Londonistan’, Paris, Brussels and Copenhagen! So, from the belly of the Euro beast, I urge the people of Iceland: stay free! Say ‘no’ to European Union! Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, the EU’s strategy for jobs sounds good, but the reality behind the scenes is very different. To take just one shocking example, the forthcoming trade agreement between the EU and India will have a devastating impact on Indian agriculture and pharmaceuticals. Indians are rightly worried by this threat to their prosperity and independence. But with the Indians giving up so much, we need to ask what is in it for Indian big business and what is it going to cost workers in Britain and Europe. The answer is Mode 4 immigration, which bypasses any national caps on immigration. Transnational corporations will gain the automatic right to bring in Indian labour to replace, for example, skilled British workers in steel and car plants and all the other industries now owned by Indian-based TNCs. The India-EU trade agreement will devastate the wages and employment prospects of hundreds of thousands of British and European workers. This is not a strategy for jobs but a naked sell-out to corporate greed. Nick Griffin  (NI

– A permanent shortage of organs for transplantation hampers the wonderful efforts of health care professionals to help patients. It is also a sad fact that there is a shortage of donors, and that this drives some vile criminal activities. To seek to address these problems by creating an EU-wide database is, however, a mistake. It is naive to place hopes in a database covering the whole of the EU, with all its different languages and IT systems, when the failed attempt to produce a Health Service database for the UK alone has wasted billions of pounds. Health services across Europe are unable even to fund basics, and face savage cuts as ordinary citizens pay for the bust of globalism. This being so, far more can be done to encourage organ donations by investing in education programmes at national levels, than by diverting funds to pay for well-intentioned bureaucratic meddling. Additionally, there are tight time constraints on organ viability. Thus, an EU-wide network would be of use to very few patients. Proposals to set one up are another pretty-sounding excuse for the further advance of an agenda that has nothing to do with patients’ welfare and everything to do with federalist dogma.

– Mr President, the most important priority of any budget should be only to spend your own money. Spending someone else’s without their permission is not budgeting, it is theft. British taxpayers are fleeced to the tune of GBP 6.4 billion in direct payments to the EU annually and we are still denied our referendum. Taking that money, without a democratic mandate, is not a victimless crime. Fifty thousand of our pensioners died of cold this winter because they could not afford to heat their own homes. Our soldiers are killed by Taliban bombs because we cannot afford blast-proof vehicles. Thousands of cancer victims are denied expensive life-saving drugs. GBP 6.4 billion would right all those wrongs and still leave change to build eight new hospitals and 50 schools. There should be only one budget priority – slash spending and stop robbing Britain. Our pensioners, soldiers and cancer victims need the money more than the EU. To you, it is a budget. To them, it is a matter of life or death. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Madam President, there is an English folk tale about King Canute who, by ordering the tide not to come in and wet his feet, showed his courtiers that not even kings are exempt from reality. In doing so, he became a byword for arrogant folly. King Canute lives on in the Council of the European Union, which begins and ends its conclusion on Arctic affairs with the alleged importance of global warming. This involves a refusal to accept scientific reality. According to the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre, Arctic summer ice has increased by 409 000 square miles, or 26%, since 2007. This is exactly what was predicted by scientists aware that the previous shrinkage of summer ice, wrongly used as evidence for global warming, was in fact nothing more than a snapshot of an ages-old natural cyclical pulse of advance, retreat and advance. So the Arctic summer ice will not vanish by 2013 and polar bears have not, and will not, drown because of global warming. But millions of hard-working voters are drowning in a sea of debt and taxes, and they are growing very impatient with the political class’s use of the global warming fraud to impose undemocratic international governance and bogus green taxes. The UN has now announced a review of the IPCC’s dodgy dossiers and fiddled statistics. On behalf of the taxpayers of Britain, I ask this Parliament to do the same and to stop wasting any more money on the most expensive big lie in human history. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, discussing tax cooperation during the current euro crisis is rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic
. The southern nations are known in English by the harsh acronym PIGS (Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain). However, those being crucified on the euro are not pigs but people, scourged by utopian one-size-fits-all dogma. Their economies will either die of a thousand cuts or be bailed out, to the ruin of taxpayers in Britain and elsewhere. There will be very little tax to cooperate over. There are two ways out: either abolish the euro and return to the captive nations of this Strawberry Soviet their own currencies, or expel the ‘problem countries’ from the euro. That might be the PIGS. More justly, it would be Germany and her French collaborator, because running the euro according to German interests is the root of this shambles. This endless crisis will destroy the federal project – tax cooperation and all. The tragedy is that it will grind so many innocent victims into poverty before it does so. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, after Copenhagen, let us reassess the whole global warming story. At Copenhagen, we had the irony of not just ‘Climategate II’, but also the onset of one of the harshest winters in decades. Since then, we have seen the debunking of the Potsdam sea-level scare; the Goddard Institute has been caught fiddling the temperature records; the vanishing Himalayan glaciers have been exposed as a fantasy; Mr Pachauri has emerged as a climate change profiteer. The world is cooling. Global warming is a fraud. This is not a victimless crime. Carbon taxes push up fuel prices, killing our old folk as we speak. The billions wasted researching this non-existent problem are billions that cannot be spent defeating real scourges such as Alzheimer’s, or ending real environmental disasters such as deforestation. Carbon credit trading makes billions for City sharks at the expense of families in poverty. The loss of agricultural land to biofuels has already doubled world food prices, so millions are starving while greedy corporations make even fatter profits. Those pushing the unscientific nonsense of man-made climate change – Shell, Monsanto, the international banks, Bilderberg one-worlders, carbon billionaires and their useful idiot allies on the left – are running the biggest fraud in human history. They must and will be called to account, as should their collaborators in places such as this. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, the horror of Haiti is shocking. It is only human to feel compassion for the innocent victims of the natural disaster there. All of us here are well paid and can afford to give. I will give my attendance allowance for today if every British MEP will do the same. However, with their taxes, our constituents cannot afford your generosity. Globalism has destroyed our industries. The banks have ruined our economies. EU red tape is strangling our entrepreneurs and the carbon-tax scam is plunging millions into deadly fuel poverty. The death toll in Haiti is shocking, but this winter, more than 50 000 pensioners in Britain alone will die premature deaths because of the cold and the cost of heating. Across Europe, the death toll will run into hundreds of thousands, but, because this truth shames the political elite and because it highlights the inconvenient truth of global cooling, this scandal will be buried as quietly as are our elderly dead. Hundreds of thousands of our own people are dying because of government neglect and EU cold taxes, yet you insist on throwing other people’s money at a disaster in somebody else’s back yard. That is not compassion: that is stinking hypocrisy. I know this place is uneasy with our Christian heritage, but as always, our Bible reveals an eternal truth that most here would rather ignore – first book of Timothy, 5:8: ‘but if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.’ Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, two months ago, my constituency was hit by disastrous floods. Deceitfully blamed on climate change, the real reason for the devastation of the town of Cockermouth was the EU-imposed privatisation/theft of public services. The proper management of reservoirs has been replaced by cost-cutting negligence by United Utilities, leading to safety margins being ignored and a panic-stricken decision to open sluice gates and release a man-made deluge on the town. The fact that only one brave man died in the floods was little short of miraculous, but such disasters will increase in frequency as more and more public services are looted by greedy corporations. Finally, my constituents are shocked that they will not receive a penny from the EU Solidarity Fund, because the UK cannot apply unless the damage exceeds EUR 3 billion. Since Britain is not in an earthquake zone, it is almost impossible to conceive of a disaster which would trigger such a payment, so British taxpayers – who contribute a disproportionate amount to the funds – have no realistic chance of benefiting from it. So much for solidarity. We want our money back! Nick Griffin  (NI

– Mr President, everyone agrees that climate change is the biggest challenge facing humanity: that is the constant claim of the political elite, and it is a lie. Everyone does not agree. Thousands of scientists dispute the very existence of man-made global warming, citing natural cyclical changes that saw vineyards in Roman northern England and a Swedish army march over the frozen Baltic to Copenhagen in 1658. As an army of global-warming zealots marches to Copenhagen, the truth is that their Orwellian consensus is based not on scientific agreement, but on bullying, censorship and fraudulent statistics. In the words of leading climatologist Professor Lindzen, ‘Future generations will wonder in bemused amazement that the early 21st century’s developed world went into hysterical panic over a globally averaged temperature increase of a few tenths of a degree and, on the basis of gross exaggerations of highly uncertain computer projections [...], contemplated a rollback of the industrial age’. In fact, there will be no bemused amazement, for the reason for this hysteria is clear. It is designed to provide the excuse for a political project of the globalists to replace national democracy with new world order global governance. It has nothing to do with science and everything to do with the globalist common purpose to tax and control us, while making billions for corporations in the green industrial complex. The anti-Western intellectual cranks of the Left suffered a collective breakdown when Communism collapsed. Climate change is their new theology, a secular religious hysteria complete with Pope – Al Gore – carbon-credit indulgences and the persecution of heretics. But the heretics will have a voice in Copenhagen and the truth will out. Climate change is being used to impose an anti-human utopia as deadly as anything conceived by Stalin or Mao.

– Madam President, there is endless rhetoric here about friendship and cooperation between every state under the sun except for Russia. China commits genocide in Tibet. Turkey denies its Armenian holocaust. The USA flattens Iraq and this place fawns on them. But for Russia, there are only pompous and hypocritical lectures. This confrontational Russia phobia shamefully feeds the new Cold War drive of America’s warmongering neo-con lobby. Of course, there are some local differences between Russia and her neighbours, but can we not agree that next week’s summit should be used to attempt to build bridges and cooperation between the eastern and western halves of our civilisation? For historical and cultural reasons, this is far more practical and safer than attempting to create unity with Turkey, Europe’s ancient and eternal enemy. Nick Griffin  (NI

– Madam President, in the last two months, I have suffered victimisation by the UK Labour regime, including withdrawal of my House of Commons pass, refusal to allow me to enter the Sellafield nuclear processing plant – despite my position on a subcommittee of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – and the refusal of the Citizens’ Advice Bureau to sell me an information database openly advertised for sale to all other MEPs. Madam President, would you agree that political discrimination is not only unlawful but is also an attack not just on me, but also on the functionality of this place and, most important of all, on the voters and the entire democratic process?

– Mr President, there are two overriding themes in this place: first, concern with the growing gulf between the political elite and the ordinary taxpayers. Second, a hysterical obsession with man-made global warming. These two themes are intimately linked. The global-warming fixation is a classic example of how the political class here is out of touch with the little people who have to pay the bills. While the EU backs the Copenhagen proposals to further the deindustrialisation of the West and the corporate domination of the Third World, a growing majority of ordinary people regard climate change as an elite scam – an excuse to tax and control us and to impose internationalist dogma and global government at the expense of the nation state. Can you not see the danger in this growing gulf? It is time to look at the facts. Man-made global warming is an unproven theory based on manipulative statistics. The so-called consensus on the issue is the product not of debate but of the suppression of expert dissent. Before the political class and the green industrial complex dare to impose a single new tax, poisoned light bulb or useless wind farm on the ordinary taxpayer, they need to try to convince the public that global warming is
 man-made, that returning to the warmer climate of medieval times would be a bad thing and that there is something that Europe – as opposed to the United States, China and India – can actually do about it. Either hold a debate and close the gap between you and the people, or do not complain when we nationalists – the ones who listen to the people – close it for you. Nick Griffin  (NI

 Mr President, last year I served as a monitor at commemorations for the 1956 revolution in Budapest. I can confirm that Dr Morvai is right to criticise those who fret about Iran while ignoring human rights abuses here in Europe. I trust that no ECR Group members here will be hypocritical enough to condemn Iran for the use of violence in elections when David Cameron is among the sponsors of Unite Against Fascism, an organisation of far-left criminals which routinely deploys intimidation and violence against nationalist dissidents in Britain. The same is true of five current Labour, Lib Dem and Tory MEPs, marked with the shame of supporting the use of British taxpayers’ money to support their own militia, which breaks up opposition meetings and attacks their opponents with bricks, darts and claw hammers. But my main point is this: however well meaning, and even justified, criticisms of Iran made here may be, they will be exploited as war propaganda by the powerful vested interests that stand to gain from a military attack on that country. Neocons, oil companies, construction corporations and the Wahabi mullahs of Saudi Arabia all want to see the sovereign state of Iran destroyed by an aggressive war. Not even European liberals are naive enough to fall for lies about weapons of mass destruction again, so human rights are being drafted in as a new casus belli
. Do not add the voice of this place to the warmongers’ chorus for a third illegal and counterproductive attack by the West on the Muslim world. Or, if you must, do not leave the war – which hypocritical rhetoric will help to justify and unleash – to the usual brave British cannon fodder: 18-year-old boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne. Instead, send your own sons to come home in boxes or without their legs, their arms and their sanity – or mind your own business.
