 Mr President, because of the lack of results from the First Railway Package in opening the railway markets, the Commission has presented this Fourth Railway Package. Its objective is to tackle the lack of efficiency and remove barriers to a free circulation of rail transport services. Today the fact is that we still do not have a single railway market in the EU.  Ever since the beginning of the negotiations on the PSO dossier I said that, for Liberals, the status quo was not an option. I stressed that we had to act now. We have to open the market as soon as possible through, for example, mandatory tendering of public service contracts. In my view, this was the only big change towards market opening. As Liberals, we were quite supportive of the initial Commission proposal whose aim was to establish a competitive tendering procedure for public service contracts as a general rule across the EU from 2019. Member States could only continue to award contracts directly up to 2019. However, the rapporteur and the socialist shadow did not share in this pressure for change. Mr[nbsp ]Grosch introduced a retrospective efficiency criterion in order to justify the continuation of directly awarded contracts by the competent authority. According to experts, this is very difficult to measure and control practically, and I do not believe change will come with this system.  I am satisfied with the reciprocity clause. This principle is important in order to limit the distortion of competition in the rail market. This principle should apply not only to Member States, but also to companies from third countries. In general I do not believe that this regulation, amended in this manner, could contribute to the opening and improving of domestic passenger transport. So, as we did in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I will recommend to the Liberals that they abstain in plenary on the PSO dossier. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

Mr President, according to the latest data from the Troika’s report, banking credit to non-financial corporations in Spain is falling again this year at a rate of 11%. At the same time, Spanish banks are increasing lending to the Spanish Government at a rate of 10%. After two LTROs and having thrown billions of euros in state aid to the banks, in some Member States this money is being used to finance government deficits instead of credit to the real economy.  The Bundesbank recently reported that Spanish banks today have EUR 300 billion in Spanish government debt. In 2009 this was only EUR 70 billion. Is this sustainable? I would like to ask Mr Draghi: is the ECB giving incentives to create huge crowding out effects? We do not want Mr Draghi to become ‘Mr Crowding Out’. In the next LTRO, money must not be used to fund government deficits while solvent SMEs in the south of Europe agonise without credit at a reasonable cost. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

I voted in favour and support this year human rights report as this is one of the most important functions, namely to perform an oversight function in respect of the Council’s and the Commission’s performance on human rights policy. This strengthens the European Union’s role as the guardian of human rights worldwide. The European Parliament should continue to be involved in the European Union’s human rights dialogues; this House should monitor and continue to raise issues linked to violations and persecutions of minorities worldwide from Tibetans and Uighurs in China to Montagnards in Vietnam to the Sam Rainsy Party in Cambodia! The EU should increase in its efforts to support non-violent opposition in all authoritarian regimes and stop the status quo and business-as-usual policy with regard to countries which reiterate and continue to abuse human rights!

I welcome greatly the fact that the 2012 Commission Competition Report celebrates and focuses on the EU single market and its 20th anniversary. I share this priority. In fact, a lot remains to be done in several sectors, such as banks, telecommunications, energy, competition authorities and transport, to achieve a non-discriminatory, well-functioning single market in Europe. In this report, I have tried to push for more transparency and collaboration between Parliament and the Directorate-General (DG) for Competition. This DG also needs more human resources to do its job. Regarding the banking sector, there is a clear problem of concentration in some Member States. Despite receiving EUR 1.6 trillion in state aid and public guarantees, the banking sector in Europe is still not working properly. Credit to SMEs in many parts of Europe is scarce and expensive, delaying the return to economic growth in the near term. In Spain, for example, credit to non-financial companies has fallen by 11 % in 2013. There is a huge ʻcrowding out effectʼ: the banksʼ purchase of public debt is expelling credit to the private sector. Regarding the transport sector, we denounce the lack of competition in the European rail market and state aid to national airlines. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,

Madam President, first of all I want to thank my shadow rapporteurs for all their good cooperation during these months, especially Andreas Schwab and Antolín Sanchez Presedo. Thank you very much for your kind cooperation. I would also like to particularly thank Commissioner Almunia and his team for our constructive work together. I very much welcome the fact that the 2012 European Commission competition report celebrates and focuses on the EU single market and its 20th anniversary. I share this priority. In fact a lot remains to be done in several sectors, such as banks, telecommunications, energy, competition authorities and transport, in order to achieve a non-discriminatory well-functioning single market in Europe. In this report I have tried to push for more transparency and cooperation between the Parliament and DG Competition and I also ask for more human resources for DG Competition in order to do a better job. Regarding the banking sector, there is a clear problem of concentration, in my opinion, in some Member States. After receiving EUR 1.6 trillion of state aid and public guarantees, the banking sector in Europe is still not working properly. Credit for SMEs in many parts of Europe is scarce and expensive, delaying the return to economic growth in the near term. In Spain, for example, credit to non-financial companies has fallen again by 11% during this year. There is a huge crowding-out effect. Banks which are purchasers of public debt are expelling credit to the private sector. Regarding the transport sector, we deplore the lack of competition in the European rail market and state aid to national incumbent airlines. The EU rail market is not functioning properly, due to incorrect or incomplete transposition of Community law by Member States. Too often, incumbent railway operators are protected by their own Member States. In this respect, I welcome the infringement procedures launched by the European Commission in the last few years in several Member States. Regarding state aid to airlines, I understand DG Competition is paying a lot of attention to regional airport subsidies to Ryanair, but we should also make sure that the rules on state aid are applied correctly with regard to national carriers such as Iberia, Alitalia and others. Rules should be the same for all actors and we should not accept the ‘too big to fail’ doctrine for airlines. European citizens should not be the ones who always end up paying. I also think the Commission should investigate the 1 000 bilateral agreements in various Member States in the air transport sector that restrict competition by imposing, for example, the requirement that any flight between two countries must stop in a given airport. In Spain, for example, 23 bilateral treaties oblige planes to stop only at Madrid airport. On the energy sector, this Parliament is asking to fully investigate the demand effect. Why is fuel so expensive on some days and so cheap on others? I believe it is not the consequence of market forces and my guess is that some sort of cartel is behind it. To solve all this, we need independent competition authorities and we need their reports to be completely non-political, otherwise we keep on supporting a system which, although theoretically in favour of competition, in practice protects the oligopolies. Finally, on the Google case, I have two questions for the Commissioner regarding the procedure. Does the Commission believe that the adoption of Google’s proposals as they stand will effectively address the Commission’s concerns about fair competition and protect consumers? If not, will you finally send a statement of objections to Google in order to impose truly significant remedies, once and for all? I call on the Commission to take our report fully into account and to act in the coming months. Thank you very much for your kind attention and I look forward to your comments and answers.

I would to stress once again my concerns over the situation of credit to SMEs in Europe. As the crisis deepens, credit to the real economy continues to fall and to be more and more expensive. Not because of the financial situation of the SMEs, but because of their location inside the eurozone. This situation has to be tackled as the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is de facto broken. Another distortion is created by the fact that some banks receiving state aid use this money to buy more sovereign debt when at the same time they reduce the credit to SMEs and households.

I abstain on this MFF because there is not enough cash to finance projects with European Added Value based on cost benefit analysis. I am afraid that funding for the Mediterranean Corridor, for example, will be too small. Moreover, if there are no own resources, the European budget will continue to be a puppet for the interest of 28 Member States and cost-efficient programs important for citizens will be forgotten. I want it to be remembered that Article 311 of the Lisbon Treaty states clearly that the MFF should be funded only by own resources. It is a pity that the Council refuses to implement it.

I welcome the agreement on the Multinational Financial Framework (MFF), and the budget for the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). We would, of course, need more money in order to realise all of the 30 core priority projects by 2030. I really hope the resources agreed in the deal on the MFF will allow us to achieve some of the aims identified: hopefully those with most European added value and based on a cost-benefit analysis! The new EU infrastructure policy aims to create a real network and no longer focuses on isolated projects. The new regulation provides for deadlines to make sure that all projects contributing to the core transport network are implemented as a priority. Let us hope that the dates of 2030 for the core network and 2050 for the comprehensive network are met. From the beginning I have welcomed recognition of the need to reinforce the EU transport network, in particular by filling in missing cross-border links between Catalonia and France and removing administrative and technical bottlenecks caused, for example, by factors like the different railway gauges that exist in Spain. I would like to stress once again the need to focus on European added-value projects, and most importantly the need for a detailed cost-benefit analysis for every project on the table.

Madam President, as a Catalan member of the European Parliament, I welcome the agreement on the TEN-T Network and transport financing under the Connecting Europe Facility. The port of Barcelona will be included tomorrow, for the first time ever, in the map of European railway and flight transport priorities, which was not the case in 2003. Ten years ago, the Spanish Government of Mr Aznar and the People’s Party (PP) excluded all the Mediterranean ports from the European network. I hope this will not be the case tomorrow.  I also think that we need more money in order to realise all the core priority projects by 2030. I really hope the resources agreed in the deal on the MFF will allow us to achieve at least some of the projects identified. Hopefully, these will include the ones with capacity to create the highest added value for the European economy such as, in my opinion, the Mediterranean corridor.

In 2003 the Spanish Government only proposed one train to the Commission: that was the train through Madrid, Zaragoza and the Central Pyrenees. I am not against that corridor but feel that the ports of Valencia, Tarragona and Barcelona, the ports of the Cantabrian Sea and also other Mediterranean ports, were excluded from that network. So I am pleased now that all these ports will be included in the priority network, along with the Aragon Pyrenees route originally proposed. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

Madam President, the rise of violent extremism is not only a Greek question. In Spain the threat of fascist groups against democratic and peaceful movements is also growing. On 11 September this year these groups attacked the Catalan Delegation in Madrid, injuring one MP and some representatives of European and international diplomacy. The radicals even used tear gas against the people, but the sanction imposed by the Spanish courts has been only a EUR 300 fine. This violent aggression happened the same day that about 2 million people held hands, forming a 400 kilometre human chain in Catalonia, asking peacefully for the right to vote on an independence referendum, as the Scottish will. Last week the leader of a legal party which harks back to Franco stated on Spanish TV that no part of Spain would separate without blood being spilt. He has not yet been detained by the police, and the Spanish government has not made any statement on this issue. I sent links to these videos to all Members of this House last week. There should be sanctions against statements like these in Europe. The quality of European democracy and the freedom of its citizens is at stake.

Mr President, Commissioner Reding, colleagues, this Wednesday, 11 September, is the national day of Catalonia. This Wednesday there will take place in Catalonia a huge and passive demonstration, which we call the Catalan Way. More than one million people will hold hands in a 400 km-long human chain, asking for independence and for the creation of a new European state: Catalonia. It will be the biggest demonstration for decades – a human chain inspired by the Baltic Way 20 years ago. We Catalans want to decide our own future; our dream is to be able to vote peacefully and democratically to decide our own future. Catalans want and hope to do the same as the Scots, who, thanks to the democratic spirit of the British Government, will vote in an independence referendum. Let Catalans vote!

Mr President, today I abstained on the vote on the multiannual financial framework agreement for two basic reasons.  The first is that this is a budget directed at subsidies and not at growth. Europe needs more economic integration, not more transfers. As a Mediterranean Liberal, I ask for this. The Council has applied big cuts to the TEN-T network, fundamental to the Mediterranean corridor and other infrastructures for freight transport. The EU budget should not be perceived to be merely an automatic cash machine for Member States.  The second reason is the concept of ‘no representation without taxation’. Without own resources Parliament and the Commission will always dance to the music of the Council, i.e. the Member States. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,

Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and all my colleagues for the very good job that they have done. As a Parliament, we only have a consultative role on the financial transaction tax (FTT). However, our vote is important to give a signal to European citizens, in the sense that we are asking for a European FTT that some Member States have been implementing on their own account. I am in favour of the FTT as a tool for better regulation of the financial markets, not to hurt or destroy them. This is why I have presented amendments to achieve various exceptions in order to keep the real economy as unaffected as possible. In this respect I particularly welcome the exemption for SMEs voted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs two weeks ago. European SMEs are today too dependent on bank financing and, in a credit crunch context in some Member States, it is fundamental to make it easier for SMEs to access financial markets. It is also very important that government bonds only pay half the tax. The FTT should not increase the interest rate spread of countries and regions. Finally, the cost of the FTT for pension funds was reduced to a quarter. However, I do not think that pensioners should be taxed by the FTT so this is why the Liberal Group will ask tomorrow for a full exemption of pensions. In summary, I think that this Parliament can give a strong signal in favour of an FTT that taxes speculation and protects the real economy as much as possible. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,

Madam President, colleagues, Commissioner and President Draghi, welcome to this Parliament. You said last summer, President Draghi, that the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro, and that was enough. The markets believed you. Yes, it was enough, and you saved the euro, the stock markets and the public debt markets and you became the man of the year. However, President Draghi, now the situation is worsening and now we risk losing Europe. In your last speech at the European Council you also recognised that in some countries, bank credit to the real economy is falling sharply. We do not have monetary union if competitive SMEs in some Member States have to close because credit is scarce and falling; we do not have monetary union if SMEs in some Member States have to close because they pay between 4 and 8% more for a loan than similar SMEs in other parts of the euro zone, and this difference has become structural. The reality is that money has gone from the ECB to the banks to buy public debt. Now, some insolvent banks and states are full of liquidity, but thousands of solvent SMEs are closing because of the lack of liquidity. It seems that the euro is more a currency board than a currency union. This is why the Liberal Group asks the ECB to create a programme to provide securitised loans to SMEs. This could restore the broken monetary policy transmission mechanism. What do you think, Mr President? And a final question: a year ago this Parliament approved, with a large majority, the European Redemption Fund as part of the Two-Pack: a partial and temporary mutualisation of public debt conditioned to fiscal discipline. But the Council used its veto. Some sort of eurobond would give the message to the financial markets that the euro is irreversible, and maybe the OMT programme would not be needed. What do you think?

Mr President, this report is important because it is one of the few in which the Commission has considered the importance of the regional level in the European Union.  I think that the Commission should be more involved in regional statistics, in order to have a clearer picture of what happens in Member States. In Spain, for example, there is no transparency law. Citizens cannot know the territorial distribution of public expenditure by the Spanish central Government. There is also no territorial information about tax collection, which remains centralised. This lack of transparency of the Spanish State is one of the main reasons now fuelling pro-sovereignty feelings in Catalonia. This is why I, in particular, welcome the annex to this regulation. The annex reflects that there should be an analysis of the inter-dependence of regions and Member States. That is why the Liberal Group will support this report. We wish to thank the rapporteur, Sharon Bowles, and all the MEPs, for their good work. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE
). -  
Mr President, in the context of the European Semester, we have to continue with deep reforms and fiscal consolidation. The euro zone debt is not the US debt, and we cannot print money as the Americans do.  In Spain, the central government has imposed public deficit targets on the regions that make no economic sense. A 0.7% GDP target for regions is totally unfair. Regions provide public health, education and welfare state services. At the same time, the Spanish central government continues to build high-speed trains and increase military spending. This year, Spain is allowed to have a 4.5% deficit that should be fairly shared between central and regional governments, as the European Parliament voted last month in the public finances report. However, the Spanish central government wants to keep 85% of the margin allowed by the European Commission, even though the central government represents only 50% of total public expenditure in Spain. I have a question for Commissioner Rehn. Do you think that Spain’s public deficit target is fairly shared between the different levels of government? Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 How to take care of public finances to make them sustainable is the main political and economic issue of this decade. And to achieve this objective, this Parliament believes that spending cuts are a much more effective strategy than tax rises, particularly if they are growth-oriented. This report also highlights the great importance of raising new revenue through fighting tax evasion. Moreover, there are two very interesting ideas that I would like to draw your attention to: First, this Parliament will state that regions that do not have responsibility on the revenue side and are funded only through central government transfers are more prone to fail in their fiscal consolidation efforts. Second, ministries and sub-sectors of government without concrete powers should be eliminated, as it makes no sense to make fiscal consolidation efforts in our social services while we maintain useless bureaucracy.

 With this reform of the Credit Rating Agencies Regulation, I think we are taking a step towards addressing one of the chief complains of our citizens since the crisis started.

Secondly, it is good to have a clear calendar of the sovereign ratings of the agencies.

As most people live in cities, and without acting against the interests of the one third of the European population that lives in smaller settlements or remote areas, it is of the utmost importance to find tools that will allow us to better design the cities of tomorrow.

 Despite the operational shortcomings that have come to light over the years, the Solidarity Fund has proven to be one of the most successful and well-received Union instruments, since it is one of the few instruments available to the Union with which it can demonstrate its solidarity with and closeness to European citizens. The changes in the economic situation of the Union and the majority of its Member States have to be taken into account, the operability of the Fund should be improved without incurring additional costs. Procedures should be clearer, more precise and more transparent. I endorse the need for a clear and precise definition of the concept of disaster, setting a general criterion for assessing the severity of damage caused, and for thresholds to be established geared to the appropriate territorial level. This would help to remove doubts and negative attitudes to the European Union among both Member States and the public, which may otherwise believe that the Union does not offer an appropriate response to their problems.

Moreover, there are two very interesting ideas that I would like to remark on now: first, this Parliament states that regions without any responsibility on the revenue side, only funded through central government transfers, are more prone to fail in their fiscal consolidation efforts. This kind of financing for regions far away from real fiscal federalism is bad for everyone. In the end it makes regions spend more than their real resources enhancing deficits and subsidies; this is the case of Spain today. Secondly, ministries and sub-sectors of government without concrete powers should be eliminated. It makes no sense to achieve fiscal consolidation efforts in our social services while they maintain useless bureaucracy. For instance in Spain, why do we need a health ministry, an education ministry, a culture ministry when all competences in these fields are in the hands of nationalities and regions?

 Today the European Parliament gave its green light to the new regulation governing the allocation of slots at EU airports, aiming at increasing airport capacity and decreasing delays. The text provides several new elements to the existing allocation regime. Firstly, a secondary trading market for slots has been introduced. This measure will allow airlines to adjust their slot portfolios according to their operational needs, while guaranteeing a proper use of the slot and enhancing the development of airport infrastructures and services.  These exchanges must take place under the close supervision of airport coordinators, so that the procedure for the sale or purchase of a slot complies with the rules and with maximum transparency. To ensure the process, the coordinators’ full independence is key to strengthening the slot allocation system and its transparency.  Another innovative element is constituted by the provision of a more incisive and effective sanctions regime against the so-called ‘bad users’, i.e. those carriers operating air services without a corresponding slot or when the use of the slot differs significantly from the scheduling period of the slot.

 I welcome the vote on Noise but I as I stated since the beginning, in my view: The Right of Scrutiny introduced in this process was essential to ensure that the balanced approach is used to identify the most cost-effective measures as intended. Without this measure, all stakeholders are exposed to the possibility of rushed, arbitrary, or discriminatory selection of mitigation measures.  Since the beginning, I feared that there was some misunderstanding about what the European Commission was proposing to scrutinise, precisely the process and not the substance and final local decision. The argument on the possibility for the European Commission to question a compromise reached at local level is not valid. Indeed, the European Commission can only give an opinion on the procedure and not on the nature of the measure adopted. It is the only means to make sure that competent authorities tackle the issue of land-use planning. As a Catalan from Barcelona, you can imagine how much I care about the principle of subsidiarity; however I still believe that the right of scrutiny gives the Commission the ability to provide oversight on behalf of all stakeholders (citizens as well ) and in my view this is a positive element.

 All the regulation that we discuss has to be done listening carefully to everyone. For me, in this case, the scientific point of view was not listened to enough. We cannot regulate on something only because we like it without listening carefully to all sides. Indeed, animal welfare, and in this case, the protection of animals during transport, is important and that is why a very careful scientifically-based approach is needed.

Madam President, today is going to be a great day for Europe, its citizens and their enterprises. After 40 years of negotiations we will have a European patent which is valid in most Member States, thereby easing the path to an enhanced single market. However, Spain refuses to join this great European project. I find it embarrassing that Spain, for petty nationalistic reasons, wants to be out. Because of this, thousands of Catalan innovative enterprises will be damaged by this Spanish exception.  As a Catalan MEP coming from Catalonia, which generates more than 30% of new Spanish patents every year, I find this astonishing. I will support this European patent because by enhancing the single market we enhance our chances of future prosperity. The Spanish Government seems to be providing further rational incentives for more and more Catalan citizens to ask for an independent state inside the EU.

 I welcome Parliament’s approval of this agreement. At a time when our economy is struggling, it is vital that the EU forges stronger links with emerging economies such as Colombia and Peru. Not only will this agreement create jobs in the EU in sectors such as the drinks, car and textile industries but Colombia and Peru will see much-needed European investment into their economy. The human rights situation is improving in Colombia and Peru and we should continue to support the efforts of the Colombian and Peruvian governments on human and environmental rights.

Mr President, I shall now speak in English as my German is not so good. Considering the noise issue, as I have said since the beginning I still believe that the article on the right of scrutiny proposed by the Commission was a positive element and has been misunderstood. I understand, however, that this is a very highly political matter for many of the Austrian and German colleagues here in this House, but the Commission was proposing to scrutinise the process, not the substance and final local decision. Without this measure, stakeholders are exposed in my opinion to the possibility of rushed arbitrary and discriminatory selection of mitigation measures.  Regarding the amendments tabled, I support the four amendments tabled by the EPP and S&amp;D Groups – Amendments 44 and 48 (identical) and Amendments 45 and 49 (identical) – on Article 1 and Article 2. These amendments reintroduce the idea that the economic cost should be taken into account and we, as Liberals, have supported it since the beginning. These amendments improve the current text.  It should, however, be noted that Amendments 45 and 49 still, in my opinion, incorrectly reflect ICAO’s balanced approach. The wording ‘minimising noise’ means that house insulation projects or land use planning could potentially not be included, as these do not ‘minimise noise’ but address a ‘noise problem’.

Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank our rapporteur, Ms Podimata, for doing a good job. The debate on whether Europe should have a financial transaction tax seems to have been overtaken by events. Realising that it was impossible to move on this all together, a group of Member States have decided that they will do it themselves. I think that it is legitimate and in accordance with the Treaties to do this through the enhanced cooperation procedure. Very often in Europe we stop going forward because a small group of Member States refuses to integrate more. As I am deeply in favour of a stronger and more integrated Europe, the use of enhanced cooperation can only be good news for me. Moreover, the decision of the Member States is a consensual and democratic one. As long as impact assessments are done to ensure that no harm will come to non-participating Member States, I think that this Parliament should give a green light to the procedure.  What would citizens from these twelve Member States say if we blocked their democratic will to have a common FTT? As a liberal, I think that we have to live and let live. If twelve Member States want to go forward along the FTT path, let it be. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

Mr President, last week the Spanish Government launched a new education law that represents an attack on the Catalan language. The proposal tries to change the status of the Catalan language in Catalan schools to make it only of preferential knowledge, instead of its current status as the main working language.  Catalan political parties representing 80% of the vote in the last Catalan elections completely reject this proposal. Teachers’ associations, the unions, schools and even the Catalan Church deplore this proposal to marginalise the Catalan language in schools. Even the Dean of the Universidad Complutense of Madrid, José Carvillo, has today supported the present system, with Catalan as the main working language for kids in school. The Spanish Government seems to be giving rational incentives for more and more Catalan people to ask for an independent state inside the EU. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– Mr President, five weeks ago there was a large demonstration in Barcelona. More than one million people demanding that Catalonia be the next EU Member State is exceptional. This is why the President of Catalonia, Artur Mas, has decided to initiate a political process calling for early Catalan elections next month. This process will enable Catalans to decide freely, peacefully and democratically if they want to become a new Member State of the European Union. The will of the Catalans is to remain in the European project. We believe in Europe, and our objective is not to be an isolated country but to become a new partner in the construction of Europe. The example of the agreement on a Scottish referendum in 2014 is an enlightening one. I hope that in Catalonia a new era for European democracy is being opened. Vice-President Vidal-Quadras’s statements calling for intervention by the Spanish armed forces in Catalonia are disgraceful. He should resign. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 I voted against ACTA because I am not comfortable with all the possibilities that this treaty opens up.

 Though there is still a lot of legislative work to do in the structural response to the crisis, this European Council meeting has been positive because it has set down the basis for fiscal consolidation and growth. In my opinion, the proposals regarding the establishment of an integrated financial framework and European banking supervisor are also positive because that will bring stability for European banking in the future. I also support the statement by Heads of State on reinforcing single market governance. I welcome the draft proposal for an Economic and Monetary Union, presented by Presidents Van Rompuy, Juncker, Barroso and Draghi, and I hope that they move on from ideas to action, in order to make Europe stronger. For all these reasons I will vote in favour of this resolution. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I welcome the approval of this technical but important dossier in order to complete the single European railway area. The aim has always been to introduce a level and open playing field to develop a genuine European railway area comparable to what the EU is trying to achieve in the air with the Single European Sky. The challenge was to open up markets, limit discrimination practices, and remove both regulatory barriers and physical bottlenecks to competition across the EU Member States. Today, Member States receive a clear message: implement this directive fully and stop the status quo in Europe. By the end of 2012, Commissioner Kallas will present the fourth railway package, which will include a requirement for more separation, the opening of the market and hopefully, the European regulatory body.

– In performing my duties as MEP, I have always been consistent on pushing to have strong and clear European legislation on maters that affect European citizens as regards independence, whichever state or nation they live in. I am among those who agree that what happens in EU waters could have a spillover effect on other territories; whether we refer to them as nations or states. Therefore, it is important to have an EU water legislation in order to avoid these problems and in order to protect one of the most important resources on earth and to have the best policy-making practices in that regard.

– It is said that with the eCall system, 2 500 lives will be saved annually in the EU and severe injuries will be reduced by 10-15%. With this service, we can avoid the suffering of 2 500 families every year. Although I note that there are several doubts about eCall, such as coordination, data protection, public and private added value services, possible false alarms generated by eCalls, etc., I can only see the positive points of it, namely, that it ensures automatic notification, faster arrival of emergency teams and that the call is made without encountering any language barrier in any EU country. I will support this report because any measure taken that helps to save lives is a very positive action. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– In the context of deep recession in some parts of Europe, it is important that in addition to the much needed structural reforms to make our economies more competitive, we take the time to think of how to attract more foreign investment into our continent. Europe has to take advantage of its special historical and cultural characteristics and, at the same time, promote SMEs and allow regions to develop their own policies to attract investors. An approach based on one size fits all is doomed to fail. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,

– Mr President, the Liberals and Democrats have worked for more than a year on this request to achieve a really effective single European railway area. We have worked in a constructive, positive and pragmatic way, and we will vote in favour of this final compromise. We have reached an agreement which is not one hundred per cent what we wanted. However, it took a lot of work to achieve this, and for me it is an acceptable package. In the negotiations with the Council, we Liberals and Democrats had to give in on the European regulatory body which should be responsible for breaking up the physical and regulatory barriers that still exist in the European Union. Today, these barriers still remain at national level, preventing and blocking the free movement of trains between some European countries. Instead of this, we have accepted the network of national regulatory bodies chaired by the European Commission. We hope it is a first step to having effective European supervision. We have also achieved in this request more transparency of financial flows in integrated companies, greater independence for national regulators, five years for the multiannual contractual agreement and more opening of the market. I therefore recommend that you support the agreement reached in the second reading. I also ask you not to support the request for a Polish line exemption, in order not to delay this request. I hope that, after the vote in favour of this request, Commissioner Kallas will present, as promised, the fourth railway package, which should include the requirement for more separation, more opening of the market and, hopefully, the European regulatory body. Mr Kallas, compared with the national status quo, in the Commission we trust. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 As a father and EU citizen I believe that we should push forward all policies to protect the most vulnerable citizens of the EU, in this case food for infants and young children. It is my belief that all public or private actions to accomplish this objective must be backed, step by step, and, of course, with all the actors being implicated. Nonetheless, sometimes big steps are needed to better achieve our goals. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 At this time of severe economic turmoil that is affecting the eurozone as a whole and particularly some Member States, we have arrived at a turning point. I believe we need to push forward – step by step but firmly – European policies that will favour a better European single market that will boost the economic wealth of the region. That is why I support all those actions which follow this line. Coordinated collective bargaining to be strengthened at the EU level should always benefit the workers and thus the EU-based companies, so as to have a more balanced and competitive and productive EU. That should go hand in hand with greater flexibility for the regions or states in implementing the policies, as the EU is diverse and has different political cultures. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 I am horrorized about how many women are affected for genital mutilation every year all around the world and it is very worrying the amount of young europeans that have the risk of undergoing this procedure every year. Even though we say women, we refer to children when they suffer this injury, and therefore, they have no option to defense themselves. And is not only about a medical reason, is about the integrity, respect, security and physical and mental health of that women. Is the respect for human rights for that women.

– The European market with more than 500 million citizens is the biggest in the world, bigger than the USA or Japan. That gives us more political power and strengthens our position as a soft power in the world in negotiating with third countries under better conditions. Having said that, it is important for me to use this tool to better implement what we think is better for third countries – democracy, freedom of the press or greater separation of powers – while opening up our markets to their products. That, of course, should not be against our industry and agricultural activity, which should be protected to compete on an equal footing with third countries. All initiatives that go in the direction described above, which give more power to the EU to protect and defend our living standards in the rest of the world, should be backed.

– I have voted in favour of this legislation as I am satisfied with the final text we achieved during the negotiations. It strengthens the economic governance framework of the EU and continues to frame in our legislation the utmost importance of fiscal discipline, and enhances surveillance for those countries experiencing financial assistance.

– I am very much pleased to say that I have voted in favour of this report. Besides reinforcing fiscal discipline and European coordination, it includes some ideas that I have pushed forward like making all Member States put in place independent fiscal councils to audit public budgetary execution, undertaking cost-benefit analysis on all reforms and investments projects. What is more, the European redemption fund has been adopted. This was the key issue for me, as it is a realistic instrument to mutualise part of the debt from Member States and make the euro an irreversible currency. To put in place the ERF is fundamental to solve the debt crisis. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– Speaking as a European and Mediterranean Member of the European Parliament, the extension of the geographic scope of the EBRD to the southern and eastern part of the Mediterranean is more than welcome. Given the work that has been done by the EBRD and the need to enhance economically this geostrategically important part of the south and east of the continent, continuing the work should be a priority for everyone, as it is for me. Giving the opportunity to those countries to better reach the socio-economic levels that we have achieved in the western part of Europe will also bring more stability to Europe as a whole and, last but not least, more coherence to our Mediterranean policy.

– From an economic point of view, in general, I have always defended the idea that deepening trade relations with third parties gives more economic opportunities to everyone. If Japan produces certain car components more efficiently that we do in Europe, we should give them the chance to distribute these in Europe so that we, as customers, may benefit. Nonetheless, all this should be based on equal opportunities for both sides, in other words, to the European companies and their skilled workers as well. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– It is somehow strange that nowadays, there is still no global regulation of transfers of conventional arms, which goes against our safety. And not only at European level, negotiations should be at a global level. That is why the negotiations that will take place in New York in July 2012 are very important. We will take an historic step forward if there are positive results, such as better transparency, national systems and internal controls, eradication of illicit markets which can be used for terrorist acts, and common standards on the import and export of conventional arms. For all these reasons, I will vote in favour of this motion for a resolution Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– The situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo is still a long way from democracy. There is a lack of respect for human rights, many activists and journalists are suffering abuse and repression, there are a lot of displaced persons and refugees because of the conflict, there is no independent judicial and media system, there is discrimination against women and it seems that the last electoral process was marred by a lack of transparency and credibility, due to the numerous irregularities and cases of fraud detected. The DRC deserves a better future. Building a democratic society requires, above all, strong political will. Because Congolese politicians are quite open to dialogue and to listening to European values, I will support this motion for a resolution. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,

– Mr President, tomorrow, the ‘two-pack’ will be voted in plenary. After six months of negotiations, we may have a strong Parliament position. We will vote on new rules on enforcing control of Member States’ finances but also on instruments that may help us out of this crisis. I am talking about the European Redemption Fund, an instrument that combines fiscal discipline and European solidarity, which are not contradictory terms. It is our responsibility to show the world that our single currency is irreversible, and that we are not ready to go back to national currencies. In this respect, the European Redemption Fund is the only realistic and achievable debt mutualisation instrument that we can get in the short run. The European Redemption Fund is a voluntary, temporary and partial debt mutualisation tool strongly related to fiscal discipline. Eurobonds will be for the next crisis, not for this crisis. Talking to our citizens about eurobonds as if they were something for next month is populism. We cannot lie to our citizens, ignoring the fact that convergence in fiscal discipline and in a common fiscal stability culture is needed before eurobonds. On the other hand, doing nothing could also be morally unacceptable. While some countries are financing themselves without cost in the short run, other countries are rapidly becoming insolvent due to the increasing cost of their new debt issues. This is why I call on all Members of this Parliament who believe in the European project to vote in favour not only of the two reports, but also of the European Redemption Fund.

– I will support all the initiatives that promote the development of social solidarity, civic values, community management, social inclusion and combating discrimination. Whereas volunteering is an informal learning experience, where you can join people of all ages, all Member States should make an effort towards developing and financing volunteering programmes and activities.

– Whereas information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the Internet environment are an important part of our lives, users need to have confidence in the security of the system, as regards privacy of data and intellectual property rights.

− I celebrate the effort and results that our President Schulz got on his visit to Ukraine and welcome the positive predisposition of Ukrainian authorities to accept the proposal of EP, such as sending medical experts to assess the health condition of imprisoned Ms Yulia Tymoshenko and sending an internationally well-respected person to monitor the second trial of the former Prime Minister. The mutual trust between the European Union and Ukraine can only be based on democratic freedoms, transparency, the fight against corruption, respect for human rights, and the unconditional immediate release of all prisoners sentenced on politically motivated grounds. Ukraine has to find the way to carry out these reforms to converge with European values, norms and standards. For all these reasons I will vote in favour of this motion for a resolution.

− I signed and support this resolution because it is intolerable that today in Europe we still experience violations of freedom of expression, discrimination, racism and violence on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Homophobia is the irrational fear of, and aversion to, male and female homosexuality and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people based on prejudice, and it is similar to racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and sexism. The European Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, and must respect and uphold and promote these values. I therefore clearly welcome this resolution to stress these principles once more. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

− Youth unemployment is probably, with our high level of debt, one of the biggest problems we have nowadays in Europe. In Catalonia, where I come from, more than 50% of people under 25 are effectively without a job and not studying. This is a disastrous situation for our societies that see how one of the better educated generations in our history has little chances to join the labour force for the foreseeable future. I support thus this resolution, and I want to specially point out the importance of paragraph 19, where the European Parliament calls on the Commission to prioritise the redeployment of the EUR 82 billion still unused from structural funds into fighting youth unemployment. I hope that the Commission takes this idea very much into account. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

− I cannot understand how, even today, we still have to call for equal pay for equal work for women in the EU. Somehow I feel ashamed to have this report in the agenda today. We all have mothers, wives, sisters, daughters, friends... we know them, we know how they work, how well they work and we know their competitiveness and efficiency, which is even higher than men in many cases. But unfortunately statistics show that women across the European Union earn on average 16.4% less than men in the EU. The difference is higher for unqualified women. I hope this will be the last time that I have to vote for gender equality in this Parliament. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– Mr President, whether the FTT should be applied in Europe has been under discussion for years. Now it seems that this Parliament, at least, is going to support it. I consider that the FTT would be better applied at global level, but I understand the practical difficulties of achieving such an objective nowadays. However, the way the FTT is implemented is fundamental to whether or not it will succeed. Government bonds and pension funds, in my opinion, should be exempt from it and the savings of our older citizens should also be protected. I hope that this will be taken into account in the trialogues. I believe that the low tax rates under the FTT will mean that it does not provoke an exit of the financial industry from the countries that apply it. In the interests of pragmatism, and because of the extraordinary times in which we are living, the Catalan Liberal Party, which I represent, will support this FTT. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE
),  
in writing. 
– I have voted in favour of the FTT as I think it is an important tool to raise revenues that eventually could become an own resource for the EU budget, diminishing its dependency on transfers from Member States. I think the rate is low enough in order not to create a real disruption on financial markets. Moreover, pension funds will be excluded, so the savings of our elderly will not be subject to the tax. I also think that government bonds should be excluded from the FTT, and I hope that the trialogue with the Commission and the Council will reach a favourable conclusion in this regard.

– At first, China was a competitor against European companies because the low cost of production there made its goods more affordable, and therefore many jobs were eliminated in the European Union. Later, however, there came a new opportunity for European companies that are now settled in China. It is true that there are still many areas for ongoing improvement, such as the development of industrial cooperation in the green economy, addressing China’s lower social, environmental and human rights standards, and increasing the flexibility of the yuan, in order not to create artificial trade advantages for China. China and the EU both know that we need each other in our economic relations, and we both know that we can derive mutual benefit from that situation. It makes no sense to be in constant competition. For all these reasons, I will vote in favour of this report. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I think it is an important step for our Parliament to have the possibility to engage on public investigations of relevant issues for our citizens. Strengthening the rules in this way will enhance transparency and the role of the European Parliament in a real separation of powers inside the EU. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– Although this is minor legislation, I welcome that it includes my suggestion to bring 1 and 2 cent coins into the political focus, as their social impact is quite low and may cost more than they are worth.

– The enhancement of the single market is, for me, one of the key policy developments at European level. The implementation of best practices into all Member States will not only create a level playing field but also increase their competitiveness vis-à-vis the rest of the world. I support this resolution as I am very much in favour of building a stronger scoreboard to oversee the actions of Member States that fail to transpose or comply with European legislation. The case of Spain is, in that sense, an example of what should not be done. The Late Payments Directive has been widely violated and has worsened the crisis in Spain by destroying thousands of jobs and enterprises due to late payments from the public administration.

– The situation regarding women’s rights and gender equality in Turkey has been improving – particularly over the last 5 years – but not as quickly as we would have wished. Full gender equality has therefore not been attained yet. It is something that will only be attained when the mentality of Turkish society, and chiefly of Turkish men, changes completely. I agree with the rapporteur that the first initiatives should be taken by politicians and the media, but obviously there is a lot of transversal work to do, and it is important to make a special effort on education, in the labour market and in penal legislation, because all violence against women has to be punished without exception. The Turkish Government should adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards violence against women. With Turkey a candidate country, I will give a vote of hope to Turkish women and encourage its government to adhere to the gender aspect of Europe 2020. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I very much welcome today’s vote on the future of regional airports. As a Catalan with an important ‘regional’ airport like Barcelona and other minor ones such as Lleida, Girona and Reus, I believe that the role of such airports should be recognised fully. However in these times of severe economic crisis, I would like to underscore the importance of cost-benefit analyses when constructing new regional airports in Spain, as public investments should display a certain relationship between the amounts of money spent and the number of passengers using these airports. I strongly believe that regional airports should not be tools to enhance public deficits and should be economically sustainable in the mid-term. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– As a democrat, I have always said that more transparency means better democracy. I voted in favour of these amendments and this discharge because they tend in that direction. The Committee of the Regions has a long way to go, so it is our duty to protect it and give it more political power as an institution, strengthening its role as a third chamber to represent the European regions effectively at the heart of Europe. This will, at the same time, improve our policy making by promoting a ‘bottom up’ approach. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I have always stuck to the premise that less regulation and better regulation should be our goal when we legislate. Roaming has been a very sensitive issue for many years now, and the prices have been too high for our citizens. Given the importance of having a strong single market to boost the economy, roaming charges should be based on market prices. I voted ‘yes’ to better regulation and better protection for users, as well as the fair charges that service providers deserve. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I have voted in favour of this resolution for several reasons. First of all, because I think it is fundamental to ensure that plant and animal varieties and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals shall not be patentable. Secondly, I am satisfied to see that patenting processes that come from genetic engineering are protected. Thirdly, I see that the resolution includes provisions to ensure that patenting doesn’t hamper innovation and further research. In this sense, giving support to exclude breeding processes from being patentable is a step in the right direction. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– We all agree that there should be a free and safe circulation in national and international maritime routes, a premise that is not being respected by piracy in different parts of the world. As a democrat, I welcome the EU’s efforts to combat piracy and I am especially satisfied because we are taking steps forward to solve the main cause of this situation: piracy exists because there is poverty in many countries. That is why the EU authorities have increased the provision of humanitarian assistance to people in need in these countries, in order to provide the local population with alternative livelihoods through which they can properly sustain themselves. For all these reasons, I will support this joint motion for a resolution. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– Mr President, Bankia will be nationalised this week by the Spanish central government and EUR 10 billion of public money will be used to bail out this bank. Spain’s Prime Minister, Mr Rajoy, has, for many months, repeatedly denied that this would happen in Spain and has refused to bail out some Catalan saving banks such as CatalunyaCaixa and Unnim. However, Madrid’s Bankia will be saved with public money despite its bad management and its close involvement with the bursting of the housing bubble in Spain. This is happening at precisely the same moment as regions are being obliged to cut EUR 10 billion in education and health. The Spanish Government will cut transfers to regions in order to cut basic social services and save a bank that has failed. The Commission should examine this nationalisation carefully. No discrimination between citizens should be tolerated in EU countries. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– Once again, an African country suffers a coup d’état
 that hampers its democratic development and its economic progress. I would like to support this resolution calling for a regional solution, but, at the same time, I am not satisfied with paragraph 4. We have had very little time to study the Tuareg revolt and its declaration of independence, and I do not think it is right to deny them the right of self-government and auto-determination. I know that this revolt has been violent and there remain many unanswered questions, but I would like to say that once democracy and the rule of law are re-introduced in Mali, the Tuareg issue should be tackled, if necessary, with a referendum on the independence of northern Mali.

I therefore understand and share the fears and problems of all people harassed and oppressed by their own government around the world. That is why, through the tools I have as a Member of Parliament, I think, I try to make the voices of all dissidents and non-violent opposition and the people who stand and fight for freedom and democracy heard as much as possible.

Madam President, today we will vote on a proposal which was created to revise the 2003 directive on the re-use of public sector information. Rules and practices around the re-use of public sector information differ between the new Member States and some of them have still not modified their law. Only a harmonised set of ambitious rules can enable the market to take full advantage of the commercial and non-commercial opportunities that the re-use of public data represents. Opening up governmental data for re-use can have major benefits for citizens, businesses, society and for the governments themselves.  Let me state the main modifications in the report. With this new proposal, we extend the scope to museums, archives and libraries. We also limit the maximum charge that public sector bodies can apply to the marginal cost of disseminating the information. We try to foster the use of machine-readable and open formats where possible, to accelerate the transfer and use of information. The exclusive arrangement for the digitisation of documents held by cultural institutions will not in general exceed ten years, with a regular review in the following years, preventing open-ended contracts.  Last, but not least, the new ruling will introduce an impartial body whose decision will be binding on the public sector body concerned. This body should have the appropriate level of expertise and will review the decision on re-use.  I would like to finish with some data. The EU public sector information market for digital content products and services was estimated to be worth EUR 28 billion in 2008. Opening up data to access has the potential to add EUR 40 billion per year in revenue. The proposed revision aims to correct differences arising among Member States, improve access and ensure effective cross-border use of public sector data, kick-starting the development of new services based on novel ways to combine and make use of such information to stimulate economic growth, which will help us a lot, especially nowadays. I would like to finish by thanking the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur for the good job they did.Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 Mr President, because of the lack of results from the First Railway Package in opening the railway markets, the Commission has presented this Fourth Railway Package. Its objective is to tackle the lack of efficiency and remove barriers to a free circulation of rail transport services. Today the fact is that we still do not have a single railway market in the EU.  Ever since the beginning of the negotiations on the PSO dossier I said that, for Liberals, the status quo was not an option. I stressed that we had to act now. We have to open the market as soon as possible through, for example, mandatory tendering of public service contracts. In my view, this was the only big change towards market opening. As Liberals, we were quite supportive of the initial Commission proposal whose aim was to establish a competitive tendering procedure for public service contracts as a general rule across the EU from 2019. Member States could only continue to award contracts directly up to 2019. However, the rapporteur and the socialist shadow did not share in this pressure for change. Mr[nbsp ]Grosch introduced a retrospective efficiency criterion in order to justify the continuation of directly awarded contracts by the competent authority. According to experts, this is very difficult to measure and control practically, and I do not believe change will come with this system.  I am satisfied with the reciprocity clause. This principle is important in order to limit the distortion of competition in the rail market. This principle should apply not only to Member States, but also to companies from third countries. In general I do not believe that this regulation, amended in this manner, could contribute to the opening and improving of domestic passenger transport. So, as we did in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I will recommend to the Liberals that they abstain in plenary on the PSO dossier. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

Mr President, according to the latest data from the Troika’s report, banking credit to non-financial corporations in Spain is falling again this year at a rate of 11%. At the same time, Spanish banks are increasing lending to the Spanish Government at a rate of 10%. After two LTROs and having thrown billions of euros in state aid to the banks, in some Member States this money is being used to finance government deficits instead of credit to the real economy.  The Bundesbank recently reported that Spanish banks today have EUR 300 billion in Spanish government debt. In 2009 this was only EUR 70 billion. Is this sustainable? I would like to ask Mr Draghi: is the ECB giving incentives to create huge crowding out effects? We do not want Mr Draghi to become ‘Mr Crowding Out’. In the next LTRO, money must not be used to fund government deficits while solvent SMEs in the south of Europe agonise without credit at a reasonable cost. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

This strengthens the European Union’s role as the guardian of human rights worldwide. The European Parliament should continue to be involved in the European Union’s human rights dialogues; this House should monitor and continue to raise issues linked to violations and persecutions of minorities worldwide from Tibetans and Uighurs in China to Montagnards in Vietnam to the Sam Rainsy Party in Cambodia!

I welcome greatly the fact that the 2012 Commission Competition Report celebrates and focuses on the EU single market and its 20th anniversary. I share this priority. In fact, a lot remains to be done in several sectors, such as banks, telecommunications, energy, competition authorities and transport, to achieve a non-discriminatory, well-functioning single market in Europe. In this report, I have tried to push for more transparency and collaboration between Parliament and the Directorate-General (DG) for Competition. This DG also needs more human resources to do its job. Regarding the banking sector, there is a clear problem of concentration in some Member States. Despite receiving EUR 1.6 trillion in state aid and public guarantees, the banking sector in Europe is still not working properly. Credit to SMEs in many parts of Europe is scarce and expensive, delaying the return to economic growth in the near term. In Spain, for example, credit to non-financial companies has fallen by 11 % in 2013. There is a huge ʻcrowding out effectʼ: the banksʼ purchase of public debt is expelling credit to the private sector. Regarding the transport sector, we denounce the lack of competition in the European rail market and state aid to national airlines. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,  
rapporteur

Madam President, first of all I want to thank my shadow rapporteurs for all their good cooperation during these months, especially Andreas Schwab and Antolín Sanchez Presedo. Thank you very much for your kind cooperation. I would also like to particularly thank Commissioner Almunia and his team for our constructive work together. I very much welcome the fact that the 2012 European Commission competition report celebrates and focuses on the EU single market and its 20th anniversary. I share this priority. In fact a lot remains to be done in several sectors, such as banks, telecommunications, energy, competition authorities and transport, in order to achieve a non-discriminatory well-functioning single market in Europe. In this report I have tried to push for more transparency and cooperation between the Parliament and DG Competition and I also ask for more human resources for DG Competition in order to do a better job. Regarding the banking sector, there is a clear problem of concentration, in my opinion, in some Member States. After receiving EUR 1.6 trillion of state aid and public guarantees, the banking sector in Europe is still not working properly. Credit for SMEs in many parts of Europe is scarce and expensive, delaying the return to economic growth in the near term. In Spain, for example, credit to non-financial companies has fallen again by 11% during this year. There is a huge crowding-out effect. Banks which are purchasers of public debt are expelling credit to the private sector. Regarding the transport sector, we deplore the lack of competition in the European rail market and state aid to national incumbent airlines. The EU rail market is not functioning properly, due to incorrect or incomplete transposition of Community law by Member States. Too often, incumbent railway operators are protected by their own Member States. In this respect, I welcome the infringement procedures launched by the European Commission in the last few years in several Member States. Regarding state aid to airlines, I understand DG Competition is paying a lot of attention to regional airport subsidies to Ryanair, but we should also make sure that the rules on state aid are applied correctly with regard to national carriers such as Iberia, Alitalia and others. Rules should be the same for all actors and we should not accept the ‘too big to fail’ doctrine for airlines. European citizens should not be the ones who always end up paying. I also think the Commission should investigate the 1 000 bilateral agreements in various Member States in the air transport sector that restrict competition by imposing, for example, the requirement that any flight between two countries must stop in a given airport. In Spain, for example, 23 bilateral treaties oblige planes to stop only at Madrid airport. On the energy sector, this Parliament is asking to fully investigate the demand effect. Why is fuel so expensive on some days and so cheap on others? I believe it is not the consequence of market forces and my guess is that some sort of cartel is behind it. To solve all this, we need independent competition authorities and we need their reports to be completely non-political, otherwise we keep on supporting a system which, although theoretically in favour of competition, in practice protects the oligopolies. Finally, on the Google case, I have two questions for the Commissioner regarding the procedure. Does the Commission believe that the adoption of Google’s proposals as they stand will effectively address the Commission’s concerns about fair competition and protect consumers? If not, will you finally send a statement of objections to Google in order to impose truly significant remedies, once and for all? I call on the Commission to take our report fully into account and to act in the coming months. Thank you very much for your kind attention and I look forward to your comments and answers.

I would to stress once again my concerns over the situation of credit to SMEs in Europe. As the crisis deepens, credit to the real economy continues to fall and to be more and more expensive. Not because of the financial situation of the SMEs, but because of their location inside the eurozone. This situation has to be tackled as the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is de facto broken. Another distortion is created by the fact that some banks receiving state aid use this money to buy more sovereign debt when at the same time they reduce the credit to SMEs and households.

I abstain on this MFF because there is not enough cash to finance projects with European Added Value based on cost benefit analysis. I am afraid that funding for the Mediterranean Corridor, for example, will be too small. Moreover, if there are no own resources, the European budget will continue to be a puppet for the interest of 28 Member States and cost-efficient programs important for citizens will be forgotten. I want it to be remembered that Article 311 of the Lisbon Treaty states clearly that the MFF should be funded only by own resources. It is a pity that the Council refuses to implement it.

I welcome the agreement on the Multinational Financial Framework (MFF), and the budget for the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). We would, of course, need more money in order to realise all of the 30 core priority projects by 2030. I really hope the resources agreed in the deal on the MFF will allow us to achieve some of the aims identified: hopefully those with most European added value and based on a cost-benefit analysis! The new EU infrastructure policy aims to create a real network and no longer focuses on isolated projects. The new regulation provides for deadlines to make sure that all projects contributing to the core transport network are implemented as a priority. Let us hope that the dates of 2030 for the core network and 2050 for the comprehensive network are met. From the beginning I have welcomed recognition of the need to reinforce the EU transport network, in particular by filling in missing cross-border links between Catalonia and France and removing administrative and technical bottlenecks caused, for example, by factors like the different railway gauges that exist in Spain.

Madam President, as a Catalan member of the European Parliament, I welcome the agreement on the TEN-T Network and transport financing under the Connecting Europe Facility. The port of Barcelona will be included tomorrow, for the first time ever, in the map of European railway and flight transport priorities, which was not the case in 2003. Ten years ago, the Spanish Government of Mr Aznar and the People’s Party (PP) excluded all the Mediterranean ports from the European network. I hope this will not be the case tomorrow.  I also think that we need more money in order to realise all the core priority projects by 2030. I really hope the resources agreed in the deal on the MFF will allow us to achieve at least some of the projects identified.

In 2003 the Spanish Government only proposed one train to the Commission: that was the train through Madrid, Zaragoza and the Central Pyrenees. I am not against that corridor but feel that the ports of Valencia, Tarragona and Barcelona, the ports of the Cantabrian Sea and also other Mediterranean ports, were excluded from that network. So I am pleased now that all these ports will be included in the priority network, along with the Aragon Pyrenees route originally proposed. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

Madam President, the rise of violent extremism is not only a Greek question. In Spain the threat of fascist groups against democratic and peaceful movements is also growing. On 11 September this year these groups attacked the Catalan Delegation in Madrid, injuring one MP and some representatives of European and international diplomacy. The radicals even used tear gas against the people, but the sanction imposed by the Spanish courts has been only a EUR 300 fine. This violent aggression happened the same day that about 2 million people held hands, forming a 400 kilometre human chain in Catalonia, asking peacefully for the right to vote on an independence referendum, as the Scottish will. Last week the leader of a legal party which harks back to Franco stated on Spanish TV that no part of Spain would separate without blood being spilt. He has not yet been detained by the police, and the Spanish government has not made any statement on this issue. I sent links to these videos to all Members of this House last week. There should be sanctions against statements like these in Europe. The quality of European democracy and the freedom of its citizens is at stake.

Mr President, Commissioner Reding, colleagues, this Wednesday, 11 September, is the national day of Catalonia. This Wednesday there will take place in Catalonia a huge and passive demonstration, which we call the Catalan Way. More than one million people will hold hands in a 400 km-long human chain, asking for independence and for the creation of a new European state: Catalonia. It will be the biggest demonstration for decades – a human chain inspired by the Baltic Way 20 years ago. We Catalans want to decide our own future; our dream is to be able to vote peacefully and democratically to decide our own future. Catalans want and hope to do the same as the Scots, who, thanks to the democratic spirit of the British Government, will vote in an independence referendum. Let Catalans vote!

Mr President, today I abstained on the vote on the multiannual financial framework agreement for two basic reasons.  The first is that this is a budget directed at subsidies and not at growth. Europe needs more economic integration, not more transfers. As a Mediterranean Liberal, I ask for this. The Council has applied big cuts to the TEN-T network, fundamental to the Mediterranean corridor and other infrastructures for freight transport. The EU budget should not be perceived to be merely an automatic cash machine for Member States.  The second reason is the concept of ‘no representation without taxation’. Without own resources Parliament and the Commission will always dance to the music of the Council, i.e. the Member States. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,

. – 
Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and all my colleagues for the very good job that they have done. As a Parliament, we only have a consultative role on the financial transaction tax (FTT). However, our vote is important to give a signal to European citizens, in the sense that we are asking for a European FTT that some Member States have been implementing on their own account. I am in favour of the FTT as a tool for better regulation of the financial markets, not to hurt or destroy them. This is why I have presented amendments to achieve various exceptions in order to keep the real economy as unaffected as possible. In this respect I particularly welcome the exemption for SMEs voted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs two weeks ago. European SMEs are today too dependent on bank financing and, in a credit crunch context in some Member States, it is fundamental to make it easier for SMEs to access financial markets. It is also very important that government bonds only pay half the tax. The FTT should not increase the interest rate spread of countries and regions. Finally, the cost of the FTT for pension funds was reduced to a quarter. However, I do not think that pensioners should be taxed by the FTT so this is why the Liberal Group will ask tomorrow for a full exemption of pensions. In summary, I think that this Parliament can give a strong signal in favour of an FTT that taxes speculation and protects the real economy as much as possible. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,

Madam President, colleagues, Commissioner and President Draghi, welcome to this Parliament. You said last summer, President Draghi, that the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro, and that was enough. The markets believed you. Yes, it was enough, and you saved the euro, the stock markets and the public debt markets and you became the man of the year. However, President Draghi, now the situation is worsening and now we risk losing Europe. In your last speech at the European Council you also recognised that in some countries, bank credit to the real economy is falling sharply. We do not have monetary union if competitive SMEs in some Member States have to close because credit is scarce and falling; we do not have monetary union if SMEs in some Member States have to close because they pay between 4 and 8% more for a loan than similar SMEs in other parts of the euro zone, and this difference has become structural. The reality is that money has gone from the ECB to the banks to buy public debt. Now, some insolvent banks and states are full of liquidity, but thousands of solvent SMEs are closing because of the lack of liquidity. It seems that the euro is more a currency board than a currency union. This is why the Liberal Group asks the ECB to create a programme to provide securitised loans to SMEs. This could restore the broken monetary policy transmission mechanism. What do you think, Mr President? And a final question: a year ago this Parliament approved, with a large majority, the European Redemption Fund as part of the Two-Pack: a partial and temporary mutualisation of public debt conditioned to fiscal discipline. But the Council used its veto. Some sort of eurobond would give the message to the financial markets that the euro is irreversible, and maybe the OMT programme would not be needed. What do you think? Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,

Mr President, this report is important because it is one of the few in which the Commission has considered the importance of the regional level in the European Union.  I think that the Commission should be more involved in regional statistics, in order to have a clearer picture of what happens in Member States. In Spain, for example, there is no transparency law. Citizens cannot know the territorial distribution of public expenditure by the Spanish central Government. There is also no territorial information about tax collection, which remains centralised. This lack of transparency of the Spanish State is one of the main reasons now fuelling pro-sovereignty feelings in Catalonia. This is why I, in particular, welcome the annex to this regulation. The annex reflects that there should be an analysis of the inter-dependence of regions and Member States. That is why the Liberal Group will support this report. We wish to thank the rapporteur, Sharon Bowles, and all the MEPs, for their good work. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

Mr President, in the context of the European Semester, we have to continue with deep reforms and fiscal consolidation. The euro zone debt is not the US debt, and we cannot print money as the Americans do.  In Spain, the central government has imposed public deficit targets on the regions that make no economic sense. A 0.7% GDP target for regions is totally unfair. Regions provide public health, education and welfare state services. At the same time, the Spanish central government continues to build high-speed trains and increase military spending. This year, Spain is allowed to have a 4.5% deficit that should be fairly shared between central and regional governments, as the European Parliament voted last month in the public finances report. However, the Spanish central government wants to keep 85% of the margin allowed by the European Commission, even though the central government represents only 50% of total public expenditure in Spain. I have a question for Commissioner Rehn. Do you think that Spain’s public deficit target is fairly shared between the different levels of government? Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 How to take care of public finances to make them sustainable is the main political and economic issue of this decade. And to achieve this objective, this Parliament believes that spending cuts are a much more effective strategy than tax rises, particularly if they are growth-oriented. This report also highlights the great importance of raising new revenue through fighting tax evasion. Moreover, there are two very interesting ideas that I would like to draw your attention to: First, this Parliament will state that regions that do not have responsibility on the revenue side and are funded only through central government transfers are more prone to fail in their fiscal consolidation efforts. Second, ministries and sub-sectors of government without concrete powers should be eliminated, as it makes no sense to make fiscal consolidation efforts in our social services while we maintain useless bureaucracy.

 With this reform of the Credit Rating Agencies Regulation, I think we are taking a step towards addressing one of the chief complains of our citizens since the crisis started. Three issues are relevant in this context. Firstly, with this Regulation we aim to break the link between regulation and credit ratings, which has given too much power to the latter. Secondly, it is good to have a clear calendar of the sovereign ratings of the agencies. Thirdly, I support the idea that the Commission will produce a report on a public rating agency, but I would like this to be a foundation with a public-private partnership, in order to enhance its credibility.

I am in favour of pushing forward the necessary public policies that it has been determined will diminish the pain of the turmoil that is affecting our cities and at the same time will help to construct a better society. As most people live in cities, and without acting against the interests of the one third of the European population that lives in smaller settlements or remote areas, it is of the utmost importance to find tools that will allow us to better design the cities of tomorrow. Economic growth that brings sustainable job creation, social cohesion and enhanced and better quality of life should be a public policy that has to be carried out. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 In the midst of the economic turmoil it is of the great importance to optimise the public resources that we have. Hence, to achieve the goals we have agreed upon it is necessary to invest our resources where they can provide the best possible outcome. Greater integration of the funds and their coordination will surely make them more efficient and help to achieve what the citizens expect. Reducing red tape as much as possible is also crucial.

 Despite the operational shortcomings that have come to light over the years, the Solidarity Fund has proven to be one of the most successful and well-received Union instruments, since it is one of the few instruments available to the Union with which it can demonstrate its solidarity with and closeness to European citizens. The changes in the economic situation of the Union and the majority of its Member States have to be taken into account, the operability of the Fund should be improved without incurring additional costs. Procedures should be clearer, more precise and more transparent. I endorse the need for a clear and precise definition of the concept of disaster, setting a general criterion for assessing the severity of damage caused, and for thresholds to be established geared to the appropriate territorial level. This would help to remove doubts and negative attitudes to the European Union among both Member States and the public, which may otherwise believe that the Union does not offer an appropriate response to their problems. The bureaucracy necessary for the Fund’s mobilisation should be reduced. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 Living in a climate of continual delocalisation and corporate restructuring, it is of the utmost importance that employees have a say and are consulted during these processes. I support also the idea that those enterprises that do not comply with European Union regulations and directives should not receive funds from the EU budget.

 Countries located in the Horn of Africa are suffering from one of the most severe droughts of the last 60 years, which has worsened the situation of the most food-insecure regions in the world on account of the region’s poverty and underdevelopment. I welcome all the efforts and humanitarian aid that EU has focused on this region in order to improve basic social services and eradicate poverty. I agree that the European Institutions must remain vigilant and active in the fight against piracy, must be strong in the defence of peace and the promotion of democracy and human rights, and should include ad hoc
 financing lines for the Horn of Africa. I support all the humanitarian aid for civilians. That is whay I voted in favor of this resolution. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 Genetic resources coming from our environment and, in particular, traditional communities around the world, are of great importance to enhance our agriculture and improve productivity. The knowledge that these resources contain may help us better understand many issues that are still without answer in the scientific world. And more, because these resources are a stepping stone for the improvement of current medicines. Clarifying the rules of the game for inventions with their origin in these genetic resources will be good for all the stakeholders involved. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

Mr President, with this reform I think that we are taking a step forward towards addressing one of our citizens’ biggest complaints since this crisis started. Three issues are relevant in this sense: firstly, with this reform we aim to break the link between regulation and credit ratings which has given too much power to the latter.  Secondly, it is good to have a clear calendar on the sovereign ratings of the agencies. It creates certainty for all the stakeholders. However, I am disappointed that the rating agencies are not yet required to spend time physically on the location rated. Thirdly, I support the idea that the Commission will produce a report on a public rating agency, but I would like it to be a foundation with a public-private partnership in order to enhance its credibility. After three different approved laws in the last few years, I hope that this new reform is going to be the one that lasts. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,

 Madam President, how to take care of public finances to make them sustainable is the main political and economic issue of this decade. To achieve this objective the main groups of this Parliament believe that spending cuts are more effective than tax rises if they are growth oriented. This report also remarks the great importance of raising new revenues through fighting tax evasion, which is very high in some of the European countries. Moreover, there are two very interesting ideas that I would like to remark on now: first, this Parliament states that regions without any responsibility on the revenue side, only funded through central government transfers, are more prone to fail in their fiscal consolidation efforts. This kind of financing for regions far away from real fiscal federalism is bad for everyone. In the end it makes regions spend more than their real resources enhancing deficits and subsidies; this is the case of Spain today. Secondly, ministries and sub-sectors of government without concrete powers should be eliminated. It makes no sense to achieve fiscal consolidation efforts in our social services while they maintain useless bureaucracy. For instance in Spain, why do we need a health ministry, an education ministry, a culture ministry when all competences in these fields are in the hands of nationalities and regions? Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, vorrei infine ringraziare l'onorevole Pallone per tutto il suo grande e buon lavoro. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 Today the European Parliament gave its green light to the new regulation governing the allocation of slots at EU airports, aiming at increasing airport capacity and decreasing delays. The text provides several new elements to the existing allocation regime. Firstly, a secondary trading market for slots has been introduced. This measure will allow airlines to adjust their slot portfolios according to their operational needs, while guaranteeing a proper use of the slot and enhancing the development of airport infrastructures and services.  These exchanges must take place under the close supervision of airport coordinators, so that the procedure for the sale or purchase of a slot complies with the rules and with maximum transparency. To ensure the process, the coordinators’ full independence is key to strengthening the slot allocation system and its transparency.  Another innovative element is constituted by the provision of a more incisive and effective sanctions regime against the so-called ‘bad users’, i.e. those carriers operating air services without a corresponding slot or when the use of the slot differs significantly from the scheduling period of the slot.

 I welcome the vote on Noise but I as I stated since the beginning, in my view: The Right of Scrutiny introduced in this process was essential to ensure that the balanced approach is used to identify the most cost-effective measures as intended. Without this measure, all stakeholders are exposed to the possibility of rushed, arbitrary, or discriminatory selection of mitigation measures.  Since the beginning, I feared that there was some misunderstanding about what the European Commission was proposing to scrutinise, precisely the process and not the substance and final local decision. The argument on the possibility for the European Commission to question a compromise reached at local level is not valid. Indeed, the European Commission can only give an opinion on the procedure and not on the nature of the measure adopted. It is the only means to make sure that competent authorities tackle the issue of land-use planning. As a Catalan from Barcelona, you can imagine how much I care about the principle of subsidiarity; however I still believe that the right of scrutiny gives the Commission the ability to provide oversight on behalf of all stakeholders (citizens as well ) and in my view this is a positive element.

 All the regulation that we discuss has to be done listening carefully to everyone. For me, in this case, the scientific point of view was not listened to enough. We cannot regulate on something only because we like it without listening carefully to all sides. Indeed, animal welfare, and in this case, the protection of animals during transport, is important and that is why a very careful scientifically-based approach is needed.

Madam President, today is going to be a great day for Europe, its citizens and their enterprises. After 40 years of negotiations we will have a European patent which is valid in most Member States, thereby easing the path to an enhanced single market. However, Spain refuses to join this great European project. I find it embarrassing that Spain, for petty nationalistic reasons, wants to be out. Because of this, thousands of Catalan innovative enterprises will be damaged by this Spanish exception.  As a Catalan MEP coming from Catalonia, which generates more than 30% of new Spanish patents every year, I find this astonishing. I will support this European patent because by enhancing the single market we enhance our chances of future prosperity. The Spanish Government seems to be providing further rational incentives for more and more Catalan citizens to ask for an independent state inside the EU.

 I welcome Parliament’s approval of this agreement. At a time when our economy is struggling, it is vital that the EU forges stronger links with emerging economies such as Colombia and Peru. Not only will this agreement create jobs in the EU in sectors such as the drinks, car and textile industries but Colombia and Peru will see much-needed European investment into their economy. The human rights situation is improving in Colombia and Peru and we should continue to support the efforts of the Colombian and Peruvian governments on human and environmental rights.

Mr President, I shall now speak in English as my German is not so good. Considering the noise issue, as I have said since the beginning I still believe that the article on the right of scrutiny proposed by the Commission was a positive element and has been misunderstood. I understand, however, that this is a very highly political matter for many of the Austrian and German colleagues here in this House, but the Commission was proposing to scrutinise the process, not the substance and final local decision. Without this measure, stakeholders are exposed in my opinion to the possibility of rushed arbitrary and discriminatory selection of mitigation measures.  Regarding the amendments tabled, I support the four amendments tabled by the EPP and S&amp;D Groups – Amendments 44 and 48 (identical) and Amendments 45 and 49 (identical) – on Article 1 and Article 2. These amendments reintroduce the idea that the economic cost should be taken into account and we, as Liberals, have supported it since the beginning. These amendments improve the current text.  It should, however, be noted that Amendments 45 and 49 still, in my opinion, incorrectly reflect ICAO’s balanced approach. The wording ‘minimising noise’ means that house insulation projects or land use planning could potentially not be included, as these do not ‘minimise noise’ but address a ‘noise problem’.

Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank our rapporteur, Ms Podimata, for doing a good job. The debate on whether Europe should have a financial transaction tax seems to have been overtaken by events. Realising that it was impossible to move on this all together, a group of Member States have decided that they will do it themselves. I think that it is legitimate and in accordance with the Treaties to do this through the enhanced cooperation procedure. Very often in Europe we stop going forward because a small group of Member States refuses to integrate more. As I am deeply in favour of a stronger and more integrated Europe, the use of enhanced cooperation can only be good news for me. Moreover, the decision of the Member States is a consensual and democratic one. As long as impact assessments are done to ensure that no harm will come to non-participating Member States, I think that this Parliament should give a green light to the procedure.  What would citizens from these twelve Member States say if we blocked their democratic will to have a common FTT? As a liberal, I think that we have to live and let live. If twelve Member States want to go forward along the FTT path, let it be. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

Mr President, last week the Spanish Government launched a new education law that represents an attack on the Catalan language. The proposal tries to change the status of the Catalan language in Catalan schools to make it only of preferential knowledge, instead of its current status as the main working language.  Catalan political parties representing 80% of the vote in the last Catalan elections completely reject this proposal. Teachers’ associations, the unions, schools and even the Catalan Church deplore this proposal to marginalise the Catalan language in schools. Even the Dean of the Universidad Complutense of Madrid, José Carvillo, has today supported the present system, with Catalan as the main working language for kids in school. The Spanish Government seems to be giving rational incentives for more and more Catalan people to ask for an independent state inside the EU. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– Mr President, five weeks ago there was a large demonstration in Barcelona. More than one million people demanding that Catalonia be the next EU Member State is exceptional. This is why the President of Catalonia, Artur Mas, has decided to initiate a political process calling for early Catalan elections next month. This process will enable Catalans to decide freely, peacefully and democratically if they want to become a new Member State of the European Union. The will of the Catalans is to remain in the European project. We believe in Europe, and our objective is not to be an isolated country but to become a new partner in the construction of Europe. The example of the agreement on a Scottish referendum in 2014 is an enlightening one. I hope that in Catalonia a new era for European democracy is being opened. Vice-President Vidal-Quadras’s statements calling for intervention by the Spanish armed forces in Catalonia are disgraceful. He should resign. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 Though there is still a lot of legislative work to do in the structural response to the crisis, this European Council meeting has been positive because it has set down the basis for fiscal consolidation and growth. In my opinion, the proposals regarding the establishment of an integrated financial framework and European banking supervisor are also positive because that will bring stability for European banking in the future. I also support the statement by Heads of State on reinforcing single market governance. I welcome the draft proposal for an Economic and Monetary Union, presented by Presidents Van Rompuy, Juncker, Barroso and Draghi, and I hope that they move on from ideas to action, in order to make Europe stronger.

– I welcome the approval of this technical but important dossier in order to complete the single European railway area. The aim has always been to introduce a level and open playing field to develop a genuine European railway area comparable to what the EU is trying to achieve in the air with the Single European Sky. The challenge was to open up markets, limit discrimination practices, and remove both regulatory barriers and physical bottlenecks to competition across the EU Member States. Today, Member States receive a clear message: implement this directive fully and stop the status quo in Europe. By the end of 2012, Commissioner Kallas will present the fourth railway package, which will include a requirement for more separation, the opening of the market and hopefully, the European regulatory body.

With this service, we can avoid the suffering of 2 500 families every year. Although I note that there are several doubts about eCall, such as coordination, data protection, public and private added value services, possible false alarms generated by eCalls, etc., I can only see the positive points of it, namely, that it ensures automatic notification, faster arrival of emergency teams and that the call is made without encountering any language barrier in any EU country.

– In the context of deep recession in some parts of Europe, it is important that in addition to the much needed structural reforms to make our economies more competitive, we take the time to think of how to attract more foreign investment into our continent.

An approach based on one size fits all is doomed to fail. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,

– Mr President, the Liberals and Democrats have worked for more than a year on this request to achieve a really effective single European railway area. We have worked in a constructive, positive and pragmatic way, and we will vote in favour of this final compromise. We have reached an agreement which is not one hundred per cent what we wanted. However, it took a lot of work to achieve this, and for me it is an acceptable package. In the negotiations with the Council, we Liberals and Democrats had to give in on the European regulatory body which should be responsible for breaking up the physical and regulatory barriers that still exist in the European Union. Today, these barriers still remain at national level, preventing and blocking the free movement of trains between some European countries. Instead of this, we have accepted the network of national regulatory bodies chaired by the European Commission. We hope it is a first step to having effective European supervision. We have also achieved in this request more transparency of financial flows in integrated companies, greater independence for national regulators, five years for the multiannual contractual agreement and more opening of the market. I therefore recommend that you support the agreement reached in the second reading. I also ask you not to support the request for a Polish line exemption, in order not to delay this request. I hope that, after the vote in favour of this request, Commissioner Kallas will present, as promised, the fourth railway package, which should include the requirement for more separation, more opening of the market and, hopefully, the European regulatory body. Mr Kallas, compared with the national status quo, in the Commission we trust. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 As a father and EU citizen I believe that we should push forward all policies to protect the most vulnerable citizens of the EU, in this case food for infants and young children.

 At this time of severe economic turmoil that is affecting the eurozone as a whole and particularly some Member States, we have arrived at a turning point. I believe we need to push forward – step by step but firmly – European policies that will favour a better European single market that will boost the economic wealth of the region. That is why I support all those actions which follow this line. Coordinated collective bargaining to be strengthened at the EU level should always benefit the workers and thus the EU-based companies, so as to have a more balanced and competitive and productive EU. That should go hand in hand with greater flexibility for the regions or states in implementing the policies, as the EU is diverse and has different political cultures. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

Even though we say women, we refer to children when they suffer this injury, and therefore, they have no option to defense themselves. And is not only about a medical reason, is about the integrity, respect, security and physical and mental health of that women. Is the respect for human rights for that women.

– The European market with more than 500 million citizens is the biggest in the world, bigger than the USA or Japan. That gives us more political power and strengthens our position as a soft power in the world in negotiating with third countries under better conditions. Having said that, it is important for me to use this tool to better implement what we think is better for third countries – democracy, freedom of the press or greater separation of powers – while opening up our markets to their products. That, of course, should not be against our industry and agricultural activity, which should be protected to compete on an equal footing with third countries. All initiatives that go in the direction described above, which give more power to the EU to protect and defend our living standards in the rest of the world, should be backed.

What is more, the European redemption fund has been adopted. This was the key issue for me, as it is a realistic instrument to mutualise part of the debt from Member States and make the euro an irreversible currency.

We will take an historic step forward if there are positive results, such as better transparency, national systems and internal controls, eradication of illicit markets which can be used for terrorist acts, and common standards on the import and export of conventional arms.

There is a lack of respect for human rights, many activists and journalists are suffering abuse and repression, there are a lot of displaced persons and refugees because of the conflict, there is no independent judicial and media system, there is discrimination against women and it seems that the last electoral process was marred by a lack of transparency and credibility, due to the numerous irregularities and cases of fraud detected. The DRC deserves a better future. Building a democratic society requires, above all, strong political will. Because Congolese politicians are quite open to dialogue and to listening to European values, I will support this motion for a resolution. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,

– Mr President, tomorrow, the ‘two-pack’ will be voted in plenary. After six months of negotiations, we may have a strong Parliament position. We will vote on new rules on enforcing control of Member States’ finances but also on instruments that may help us out of this crisis. I am talking about the European Redemption Fund, an instrument that combines fiscal discipline and European solidarity, which are not contradictory terms. It is our responsibility to show the world that our single currency is irreversible, and that we are not ready to go back to national currencies. In this respect, the European Redemption Fund is the only realistic and achievable debt mutualisation instrument that we can get in the short run. The European Redemption Fund is a voluntary, temporary and partial debt mutualisation tool strongly related to fiscal discipline. Eurobonds will be for the next crisis, not for this crisis. Talking to our citizens about eurobonds as if they were something for next month is populism. We cannot lie to our citizens, ignoring the fact that convergence in fiscal discipline and in a common fiscal stability culture is needed before eurobonds. On the other hand, doing nothing could also be morally unacceptable. While some countries are financing themselves without cost in the short run, other countries are rapidly becoming insolvent due to the increasing cost of their new debt issues. This is why I call on all Members of this Parliament who believe in the European project to vote in favour not only of the two reports, but also of the European Redemption Fund.

The mutual trust between the European Union and Ukraine can only be based on democratic freedoms, transparency, the fight against corruption, respect for human rights, and the unconditional immediate release of all prisoners sentenced on politically motivated grounds.

− I signed and support this resolution because it is intolerable that today in Europe we still experience violations of freedom of expression, discrimination, racism and violence on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Homophobia is the irrational fear of, and aversion to, male and female homosexuality and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people based on prejudice, and it is similar to racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and sexism. The European Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, and must respect and uphold and promote these values. I therefore clearly welcome this resolution to stress these principles once more. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

In Catalonia, where I come from, more than 50% of people under 25 are effectively without a job and not studying. This is a disastrous situation for our societies that see how one of the better educated generations in our history has little chances to join the labour force for the foreseeable future. I support thus this resolution, and I want to specially point out the importance of paragraph 19, where the European Parliament calls on the Commission to prioritise the redeployment of the EUR 82 billion still unused from structural funds into fighting youth unemployment. I hope that the Commission takes this idea very much into account. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

− I cannot understand how, even today, we still have to call for equal pay for equal work for women in the EU. Somehow I feel ashamed to have this report in the agenda today. We all have mothers, wives, sisters, daughters, friends... we know them, we know how they work, how well they work and we know their competitiveness and efficiency, which is even higher than men in many cases. But unfortunately statistics show that women across the European Union earn on average 16.4% less than men in the EU. The difference is higher for unqualified women. I hope this will be the last time that I have to vote for gender equality in this Parliament. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– Mr President, whether the FTT should be applied in Europe has been under discussion for years. Now it seems that this Parliament, at least, is going to support it. I consider that the FTT would be better applied at global level, but I understand the practical difficulties of achieving such an objective nowadays. However, the way the FTT is implemented is fundamental to whether or not it will succeed. Government bonds and pension funds, in my opinion, should be exempt from it and the savings of our older citizens should also be protected. I hope that this will be taken into account in the trialogues. I believe that the low tax rates under the FTT will mean that it does not provoke an exit of the financial industry from the countries that apply it. In the interests of pragmatism, and because of the extraordinary times in which we are living, the Catalan Liberal Party, which I represent, will support this FTT. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I have voted in favour of the FTT as I think it is an important tool to raise revenues that eventually could become an own resource for the EU budget, diminishing its dependency on transfers from Member States. I think the rate is low enough in order not to create a real disruption on financial markets. Moreover, pension funds will be excluded, so the savings of our elderly will not be subject to the tax. I also think that government bonds should be excluded from the FTT, and I hope that the trialogue with the Commission and the Council will reach a favourable conclusion in this regard.

– At first, China was a competitor against European companies because the low cost of production there made its goods more affordable, and therefore many jobs were eliminated in the European Union. Later, however, there came a new opportunity for European companies that are now settled in China. It is true that there are still many areas for ongoing improvement, such as the development of industrial cooperation in the green economy, addressing China’s lower social, environmental and human rights standards, and increasing the flexibility of the yuan, in order not to create artificial trade advantages for China. China and the EU both know that we need each other in our economic relations, and we both know that we can derive mutual benefit from that situation. It makes no sense to be in constant competition. For all these reasons, I will vote in favour of this report. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– Although this is minor legislation, I welcome that it includes my suggestion to bring 1 and 2 cent coins into the political focus, as their social impact is quite low and may cost more than they are worth.

– The enhancement of the single market is, for me, one of the key policy developments at European level. The implementation of best practices into all Member States will not only create a level playing field but also increase their competitiveness vis-à-vis the rest of the world. I support this resolution as I am very much in favour of building a stronger scoreboard to oversee the actions of Member States that fail to transpose or comply with European legislation. The case of Spain is, in that sense, an example of what should not be done. The Late Payments Directive has been widely violated and has worsened the crisis in Spain by destroying thousands of jobs and enterprises due to late payments from the public administration.

– The situation regarding women’s rights and gender equality in Turkey has been improving – particularly over the last 5 years – but not as quickly as we would have wished. Full gender equality has therefore not been attained yet. It is something that will only be attained when the mentality of Turkish society, and chiefly of Turkish men, changes completely. I agree with the rapporteur that the first initiatives should be taken by politicians and the media, but obviously there is a lot of transversal work to do, and it is important to make a special effort on education, in the labour market and in penal legislation, because all violence against women has to be punished without exception. The Turkish Government should adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards violence against women. With Turkey a candidate country, I will give a vote of hope to Turkish women and encourage its government to adhere to the gender aspect of Europe 2020. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I very much welcome today’s vote on the future of regional airports. As a Catalan with an important ‘regional’ airport like Barcelona and other minor ones such as Lleida, Girona and Reus, I believe that the role of such airports should be recognised fully. However in these times of severe economic crisis, I would like to underscore the importance of cost-benefit analyses when constructing new regional airports in Spain, as public investments should display a certain relationship between the amounts of money spent and the number of passengers using these airports. I strongly believe that regional airports should not be tools to enhance public deficits and should be economically sustainable in the mid-term. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– As a democrat, I have always said that more transparency means better democracy. I voted in favour of these amendments and this discharge because they tend in that direction. The Committee of the Regions has a long way to go, so it is our duty to protect it and give it more political power as an institution, strengthening its role as a third chamber to represent the European regions effectively at the heart of Europe. This will, at the same time, improve our policy making by promoting a ‘bottom up’ approach. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I have always stuck to the premise that less regulation and better regulation should be our goal when we legislate. Roaming has been a very sensitive issue for many years now, and the prices have been too high for our citizens. Given the importance of having a strong single market to boost the economy, roaming charges should be based on market prices. I voted ‘yes’ to better regulation and better protection for users, as well as the fair charges that service providers deserve. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I have voted in favour of this resolution for several reasons. First of all, because I think it is fundamental to ensure that plant and animal varieties and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals shall not be patentable. Secondly, I am satisfied to see that patenting processes that come from genetic engineering are protected. Thirdly, I see that the resolution includes provisions to ensure that patenting doesn’t hamper innovation and further research. In this sense, giving support to exclude breeding processes from being patentable is a step in the right direction. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– We all agree that there should be a free and safe circulation in national and international maritime routes, a premise that is not being respected by piracy in different parts of the world. As a democrat, I welcome the EU’s efforts to combat piracy and I am especially satisfied because we are taking steps forward to solve the main cause of this situation: piracy exists because there is poverty in many countries. That is why the EU authorities have increased the provision of humanitarian assistance to people in need in these countries, in order to provide the local population with alternative livelihoods through which they can properly sustain themselves. For all these reasons, I will support this joint motion for a resolution. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– Mr President, Bankia will be nationalised this week by the Spanish central government and EUR 10 billion of public money will be used to bail out this bank. Spain’s Prime Minister, Mr Rajoy, has, for many months, repeatedly denied that this would happen in Spain and has refused to bail out some Catalan saving banks such as CatalunyaCaixa and Unnim. However, Madrid’s Bankia will be saved with public money despite its bad management and its close involvement with the bursting of the housing bubble in Spain. This is happening at precisely the same moment as regions are being obliged to cut EUR 10 billion in education and health. The Spanish Government will cut transfers to regions in order to cut basic social services and save a bank that has failed. The Commission should examine this nationalisation carefully. No discrimination between citizens should be tolerated in EU countries. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I very much welcome this public stance of Parliament in favour of eGovernment.

– Once again, an African country suffers a coup d’état
 that hampers its democratic development and its economic progress. I would like to support this resolution calling for a regional solution, but, at the same time, I am not satisfied with paragraph 4. We have had very little time to study the Tuareg revolt and its declaration of independence, and I do not think it is right to deny them the right of self-government and auto-determination. I know that this revolt has been violent and there remain many unanswered questions, but I would like to say that once democracy and the rule of law are re-introduced in Mali, the Tuareg issue should be tackled, if necessary, with a referendum on the independence of northern Mali.

– The strategy for biodiversity is one of the key policies for green growth that we should push forward as one of our main priorities either in the EU, as voted in this dossier, or – I add – in all of the international agreements that we have to sign. In fact, without respecting and protecting biodiversity in the EU, there is no future.

Thus, I voted in favour of all amendments and in favour of the report, which is in line with the strategy of taking ambitious and realistic action towards achieving the programme. Responsible economic growth should – in the 21st century – be part of every policy, and not only those related to the environment, in order to ensure that our heritage is respected and that the world is protected for our descendants.

The Catalan people have been demanding respect for their rights peacefully and constantly, even in the worst moments of our history, the civil war and under Franco’s fascist regime only 40 years ago. I therefore understand and share the fears and problems of all people harassed and oppressed by their own government around the world. That is why, through the tools I have as a Member of Parliament, I think, I try to make the voices of all dissidents and non-violent opposition and the people who stand and fight for freedom and democracy heard as much as possible. I always try to denounce publicly the violations and abuses of human rights that take place all around the world and I call for the European Union to stop ‘business as usual’ in its relations with many authoritarian regimes around the world. That is why I voted in favour of this report. Salvador Sedó i Alabart,

Madam President, today we will vote on a proposal which was created to revise the 2003 directive on the re-use of public sector information. Rules and practices around the re-use of public sector information differ between the new Member States and some of them have still not modified their law. Only a harmonised set of ambitious rules can enable the market to take full advantage of the commercial and non-commercial opportunities that the re-use of public data represents. Opening up governmental data for re-use can have major benefits for citizens, businesses, society and for the governments themselves.  Let me state the main modifications in the report. With this new proposal, we extend the scope to museums, archives and libraries. We also limit the maximum charge that public sector bodies can apply to the marginal cost of disseminating the information. We try to foster the use of machine-readable and open formats where possible, to accelerate the transfer and use of information. The exclusive arrangement for the digitisation of documents held by cultural institutions will not in general exceed ten years, with a regular review in the following years, preventing open-ended contracts.  Last, but not least, the new ruling will introduce an impartial body whose decision will be binding on the public sector body concerned. This body should have the appropriate level of expertise and will review the decision on re-use.  I would like to finish with some data. The EU public sector information market for digital content products and services was estimated to be worth EUR 28 billion in 2008. Opening up data to access has the potential to add EUR 40 billion per year in revenue. The proposed revision aims to correct differences arising among Member States, improve access and ensure effective cross-border use of public sector data, kick-starting the development of new services based on novel ways to combine and make use of such information to stimulate economic growth, which will help us a lot, especially nowadays. I would like to finish by thanking the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur for the good job they did.Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 Mr President, because of the lack of results from the First Railway Package in opening the railway markets, the Commission has presented this Fourth Railway Package. Its objective is to tackle the lack of efficiency and remove barriers to a free circulation of rail transport services. Today the fact is that we still do not have a single railway market in the EU.  Ever since the beginning of the negotiations on the PSO dossier I said that, for Liberals, the status quo was not an option. I stressed that we had to act now. We have to open the market as soon as possible through, for example, mandatory tendering of public service contracts. In my view, this was the only big change towards market opening. As Liberals, we were quite supportive of the initial Commission proposal whose aim was to establish a competitive tendering procedure for public service contracts as a general rule across the EU from 2019. Member States could only continue to award contracts directly up to 2019. However, the rapporteur and the socialist shadow did not share in this pressure for change. Mr[nbsp ]Grosch introduced a retrospective efficiency criterion in order to justify the continuation of directly awarded contracts by the competent authority. According to experts, this is very difficult to measure and control practically, and I do not believe change will come with this system.  I am satisfied with the reciprocity clause. This principle is important in order to limit the distortion of competition in the rail market. This principle should apply not only to Member States, but also to companies from third countries. In general I do not believe that this regulation, amended in this manner, could contribute to the opening and improving of domestic passenger transport. So, as we did in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I will recommend to the Liberals that they abstain in plenary on the PSO dossier. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

Mr President, according to the latest data from the Troika’s report, banking credit to non-financial corporations in Spain is falling again this year at a rate of 11%. At the same time, Spanish banks are increasing lending to the Spanish Government at a rate of 10%. After two LTROs and having thrown billions of euros in state aid to the banks, in some Member States this money is being used to finance government deficits instead of credit to the real economy.  The Bundesbank recently reported that Spanish banks today have EUR 300 billion in Spanish government debt. In 2009 this was only EUR 70 billion. Is this sustainable? I would like to ask Mr Draghi: is the ECB giving incentives to create huge crowding out effects? We do not want Mr Draghi to become ‘Mr Crowding Out’. In the next LTRO, money must not be used to fund government deficits while solvent SMEs in the south of Europe agonise without credit at a reasonable cost. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

I voted in favour and support this year human rights report as this is one of the most important functions, namely to perform an oversight function in respect of the Council’s and the Commission’s performance on human rights policy. This strengthens the European Union’s role as the guardian of human rights worldwide. The European Parliament should continue to be involved in the European Union’s human rights dialogues; this House should monitor and continue to raise issues linked to violations and persecutions of minorities worldwide from Tibetans and Uighurs in China to Montagnards in Vietnam to the Sam Rainsy Party in Cambodia! The EU should increase in its efforts to support non-violent opposition in all authoritarian regimes and stop the status quo and business-as-usual policy with regard to countries which reiterate and continue to abuse human rights!

I welcome greatly the fact that the 2012 Commission Competition Report celebrates and focuses on the EU single market and its 20th anniversary. I share this priority. In fact, a lot remains to be done in several sectors, such as banks, telecommunications, energy, competition authorities and transport, to achieve a non-discriminatory, well-functioning single market in Europe. In this report, I have tried to push for more transparency and collaboration between Parliament and the Directorate-General (DG) for Competition. This DG also needs more human resources to do its job. Regarding the banking sector, there is a clear problem of concentration in some Member States. Despite receiving EUR 1.6 trillion in state aid and public guarantees, the banking sector in Europe is still not working properly. Credit to SMEs in many parts of Europe is scarce and expensive, delaying the return to economic growth in the near term. In Spain, for example, credit to non-financial companies has fallen by 11 % in 2013. There is a huge ʻcrowding out effectʼ: the banksʼ purchase of public debt is expelling credit to the private sector. Regarding the transport sector, we denounce the lack of competition in the European rail market and state aid to national airlines. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,  
rapporteur

Madam President, first of all I want to thank my shadow rapporteurs for all their good cooperation during these months, especially Andreas Schwab and Antolín Sanchez Presedo. Thank you very much for your kind cooperation. I would also like to particularly thank Commissioner Almunia and his team for our constructive work together. I very much welcome the fact that the 2012 European Commission competition report celebrates and focuses on the EU single market and its 20th anniversary. I share this priority. In fact a lot remains to be done in several sectors, such as banks, telecommunications, energy, competition authorities and transport, in order to achieve a non-discriminatory well-functioning single market in Europe. In this report I have tried to push for more transparency and cooperation between the Parliament and DG Competition and I also ask for more human resources for DG Competition in order to do a better job. Regarding the banking sector, there is a clear problem of concentration, in my opinion, in some Member States. After receiving EUR 1.6 trillion of state aid and public guarantees, the banking sector in Europe is still not working properly. Credit for SMEs in many parts of Europe is scarce and expensive, delaying the return to economic growth in the near term. In Spain, for example, credit to non-financial companies has fallen again by 11% during this year. There is a huge crowding-out effect. Banks which are purchasers of public debt are expelling credit to the private sector. Regarding the transport sector, we deplore the lack of competition in the European rail market and state aid to national incumbent airlines. The EU rail market is not functioning properly, due to incorrect or incomplete transposition of Community law by Member States. Too often, incumbent railway operators are protected by their own Member States. In this respect, I welcome the infringement procedures launched by the European Commission in the last few years in several Member States. Regarding state aid to airlines, I understand DG Competition is paying a lot of attention to regional airport subsidies to Ryanair, but we should also make sure that the rules on state aid are applied correctly with regard to national carriers such as Iberia, Alitalia and others. Rules should be the same for all actors and we should not accept the ‘too big to fail’ doctrine for airlines. European citizens should not be the ones who always end up paying. I also think the Commission should investigate the 1 000 bilateral agreements in various Member States in the air transport sector that restrict competition by imposing, for example, the requirement that any flight between two countries must stop in a given airport. In Spain, for example, 23 bilateral treaties oblige planes to stop only at Madrid airport. On the energy sector, this Parliament is asking to fully investigate the demand effect. Why is fuel so expensive on some days and so cheap on others? I believe it is not the consequence of market forces and my guess is that some sort of cartel is behind it. To solve all this, we need independent competition authorities and we need their reports to be completely non-political, otherwise we keep on supporting a system which, although theoretically in favour of competition, in practice protects the oligopolies. Finally, on the Google case, I have two questions for the Commissioner regarding the procedure. Does the Commission believe that the adoption of Google’s proposals as they stand will effectively address the Commission’s concerns about fair competition and protect consumers? If not, will you finally send a statement of objections to Google in order to impose truly significant remedies, once and for all? I call on the Commission to take our report fully into account and to act in the coming months. Thank you very much for your kind attention and I look forward to your comments and answers.

I would to stress once again my concerns over the situation of credit to SMEs in Europe. As the crisis deepens, credit to the real economy continues to fall and to be more and more expensive. Not because of the financial situation of the SMEs, but because of their location inside the eurozone. This situation has to be tackled as the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is de facto broken. Another distortion is created by the fact that some banks receiving state aid use this money to buy more sovereign debt when at the same time they reduce the credit to SMEs and households.

I abstain on this MFF because there is not enough cash to finance projects with European Added Value based on cost benefit analysis. I am afraid that funding for the Mediterranean Corridor, for example, will be too small. Moreover, if there are no own resources, the European budget will continue to be a puppet for the interest of 28 Member States and cost-efficient programs important for citizens will be forgotten. I want it to be remembered that Article 311 of the Lisbon Treaty states clearly that the MFF should be funded only by own resources. It is a pity that the Council refuses to implement it.

I welcome the agreement on the Multinational Financial Framework (MFF), and the budget for the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).

I really hope the resources agreed in the deal on the MFF will allow us to achieve some of the aims identified: hopefully those with most European added value and based on a cost-benefit analysis! The new EU infrastructure policy aims to create a real network and no longer focuses on isolated projects. The new regulation provides for deadlines to make sure that all projects contributing to the core transport network are implemented as a priority. Let us hope that the dates of 2030 for the core network and 2050 for the comprehensive network are met. From the beginning I have welcomed recognition of the need to reinforce the EU transport network, in particular by filling in missing cross-border links between Catalonia and France and removing administrative and technical bottlenecks caused, for example, by factors like the different railway gauges that exist in Spain.

Madam President, as a Catalan member of the European Parliament, I welcome the agreement on the TEN-T Network and transport financing under the Connecting Europe Facility. The port of Barcelona will be included tomorrow, for the first time ever, in the map of European railway and flight transport priorities, which was not the case in 2003. Ten years ago, the Spanish Government of Mr Aznar and the People’s Party (PP) excluded all the Mediterranean ports from the European network. I hope this will not be the case tomorrow.  I also think that we need more money in order to realise all the core priority projects by 2030. I really hope the resources agreed in the deal on the MFF will allow us to achieve at least some of the projects identified.

In 2003 the Spanish Government only proposed one train to the Commission: that was the train through Madrid, Zaragoza and the Central Pyrenees. I am not against that corridor but feel that the ports of Valencia, Tarragona and Barcelona, the ports of the Cantabrian Sea and also other Mediterranean ports, were excluded from that network. So I am pleased now that all these ports will be included in the priority network, along with the Aragon Pyrenees route originally proposed. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

Madam President, the rise of violent extremism is not only a Greek question. In Spain the threat of fascist groups against democratic and peaceful movements is also growing. On 11 September this year these groups attacked the Catalan Delegation in Madrid, injuring one MP and some representatives of European and international diplomacy. The radicals even used tear gas against the people, but the sanction imposed by the Spanish courts has been only a EUR 300 fine. This violent aggression happened the same day that about 2 million people held hands, forming a 400 kilometre human chain in Catalonia, asking peacefully for the right to vote on an independence referendum, as the Scottish will. Last week the leader of a legal party which harks back to Franco stated on Spanish TV that no part of Spain would separate without blood being spilt. He has not yet been detained by the police, and the Spanish government has not made any statement on this issue. I sent links to these videos to all Members of this House last week. There should be sanctions against statements like these in Europe. The quality of European democracy and the freedom of its citizens is at stake.

Mr President, Commissioner Reding, colleagues, this Wednesday, 11 September, is the national day of Catalonia. This Wednesday there will take place in Catalonia a huge and passive demonstration, which we call the Catalan Way. More than one million people will hold hands in a 400 km-long human chain, asking for independence and for the creation of a new European state: Catalonia. It will be the biggest demonstration for decades – a human chain inspired by the Baltic Way 20 years ago. We Catalans want to decide our own future; our dream is to be able to vote peacefully and democratically to decide our own future. Catalans want and hope to do the same as the Scots, who, thanks to the democratic spirit of the British Government, will vote in an independence referendum. Let Catalans vote!

Mr President, today I abstained on the vote on the multiannual financial framework agreement for two basic reasons.  The first is that this is a budget directed at subsidies and not at growth. Europe needs more economic integration, not more transfers. As a Mediterranean Liberal, I ask for this. The Council has applied big cuts to the TEN-T network, fundamental to the Mediterranean corridor and other infrastructures for freight transport. The EU budget should not be perceived to be merely an automatic cash machine for Member States.  The second reason is the concept of ‘no representation without taxation’. Without own resources Parliament and the Commission will always dance to the music of the Council, i.e. the Member States. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,

Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and all my colleagues for the very good job that they have done. As a Parliament, we only have a consultative role on the financial transaction tax (FTT). However, our vote is important to give a signal to European citizens, in the sense that we are asking for a European FTT that some Member States have been implementing on their own account. I am in favour of the FTT as a tool for better regulation of the financial markets, not to hurt or destroy them. This is why I have presented amendments to achieve various exceptions in order to keep the real economy as unaffected as possible. In this respect I particularly welcome the exemption for SMEs voted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs two weeks ago. European SMEs are today too dependent on bank financing and, in a credit crunch context in some Member States, it is fundamental to make it easier for SMEs to access financial markets. It is also very important that government bonds only pay half the tax. The FTT should not increase the interest rate spread of countries and regions. Finally, the cost of the FTT for pension funds was reduced to a quarter. However, I do not think that pensioners should be taxed by the FTT so this is why the Liberal Group will ask tomorrow for a full exemption of pensions. In summary, I think that this Parliament can give a strong signal in favour of an FTT that taxes speculation and protects the real economy as much as possible. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,

You said last summer, President Draghi, that the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro, and that was enough. The markets believed you. Yes, it was enough, and you saved the euro, the stock markets and the public debt markets and you became the man of the year. However, President Draghi, now the situation is worsening and now we risk losing Europe. In your last speech at the European Council you also recognised that in some countries, bank credit to the real economy is falling sharply. We do not have monetary union if competitive SMEs in some Member States have to close because credit is scarce and falling; we do not have monetary union if SMEs in some Member States have to close because they pay between 4 and 8% more for a loan than similar SMEs in other parts of the euro zone, and this difference has become structural. The reality is that money has gone from the ECB to the banks to buy public debt. Now, some insolvent banks and states are full of liquidity, but thousands of solvent SMEs are closing because of the lack of liquidity. It seems that the euro is more a currency board than a currency union. This is why the Liberal Group asks the ECB to create a programme to provide securitised loans to SMEs. This could restore the broken monetary policy transmission mechanism. What do you think, Mr President? And a final question: a year ago this Parliament approved, with a large majority, the European Redemption Fund as part of the Two-Pack: a partial and temporary mutualisation of public debt conditioned to fiscal discipline. But the Council used its veto. Some sort of eurobond would give the message to the financial markets that the euro is irreversible, and maybe the OMT programme would not be needed. What do you think?

Mr President, this report is important because it is one of the few in which the Commission has considered the importance of the regional level in the European Union.  I think that the Commission should be more involved in regional statistics, in order to have a clearer picture of what happens in Member States. In Spain, for example, there is no transparency law. Citizens cannot know the territorial distribution of public expenditure by the Spanish central Government. There is also no territorial information about tax collection, which remains centralised. This lack of transparency of the Spanish State is one of the main reasons now fuelling pro-sovereignty feelings in Catalonia. This is why I, in particular, welcome the annex to this regulation. The annex reflects that there should be an analysis of the inter-dependence of regions and Member States. That is why the Liberal Group will support this report. We wish to thank the rapporteur, Sharon Bowles, and all the MEPs, for their good work. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

Mr President, in the context of the European Semester, we have to continue with deep reforms and fiscal consolidation. The euro zone debt is not the US debt, and we cannot print money as the Americans do.  In Spain, the central government has imposed public deficit targets on the regions that make no economic sense. A 0.7% GDP target for regions is totally unfair. Regions provide public health, education and welfare state services. At the same time, the Spanish central government continues to build high-speed trains and increase military spending. This year, Spain is allowed to have a 4.5% deficit that should be fairly shared between central and regional governments, as the European Parliament voted last month in the public finances report. However, the Spanish central government wants to keep 85% of the margin allowed by the European Commission, even though the central government represents only 50% of total public expenditure in Spain. I have a question for Commissioner Rehn. Do you think that Spain’s public deficit target is fairly shared between the different levels of government? Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 How to take care of public finances to make them sustainable is the main political and economic issue of this decade. And to achieve this objective, this Parliament believes that spending cuts are a much more effective strategy than tax rises, particularly if they are growth-oriented. This report also highlights the great importance of raising new revenue through fighting tax evasion. Moreover, there are two very interesting ideas that I would like to draw your attention to: First, this Parliament will state that regions that do not have responsibility on the revenue side and are funded only through central government transfers are more prone to fail in their fiscal consolidation efforts. Second, ministries and sub-sectors of government without concrete powers should be eliminated, as it makes no sense to make fiscal consolidation efforts in our social services while we maintain useless bureaucracy.

 With this reform of the Credit Rating Agencies Regulation, I think we are taking a step towards addressing one of the chief complains of our citizens since the crisis started. Three issues are relevant in this context. Firstly, with this Regulation we aim to break the link between regulation and credit ratings, which has given too much power to the latter. Secondly, it is good to have a clear calendar of the sovereign ratings of the agencies. Thirdly, I support the idea that the Commission will produce a report on a public rating agency, but I would like this to be a foundation with a public-private partnership, in order to enhance its credibility.

 The protection of our ecosystems is of the utmost priority for me. This protection of juveniles has to go. It is my belief, respecting the communities, that life in those areas is being affected and strict surveillance by the actors should be involved.

 Spain has the highest youth unemployment rate (56.5% in September 2012 informs Eurostat) of the EU. Spanish governments have been unable to give a solution to this serious problem in years, that is why Catalan people welcome this Commission proposal with optimism and hope for a better future for our young people. Although I am conscious of the different difficulties of the implementation of this measure, I will be following the application of the Youth Guarantee schemes in all Member States, especially in Spain. We will not let the Spanish Government play with the future of our sons and daughters anymore. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 The European Union has been playing a leading role in the world on green energies and we have to ensure that it will continue doing it. Boosting the public and private investment on green energies has to go hand in hand with scientific knowledge and economic criteria, thus making our investments economical and social truly in line with the 2020 Strategy. Without reasonably cheap energy our companies will not be competitive enough in the globalised world and thus will be facing unfair competition from third countries. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 I have supported this very good report of Mrs Goulard as I am of the opinion that it is time to put on the political agenda the issuance of some kind of common debt. The four steps that are envisaged in this report are quite sensible, particularly the issuance of eurobills and putting in place an European Redemption Fund that ties common issuance of debt to tight fiscal discipline. I hope that the Commission is able to react in the coming months to this report with a new legislative proposal. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 All the tools at our disposal are needed for sustainable economic growth. In this case, as well, we have to rethink how we can better use the public funds available to our cities. I am in favour of pushing forward the necessary public policies that it has been determined will diminish the pain of the turmoil that is affecting our cities and at the same time will help to construct a better society. As most people live in cities, and without acting against the interests of the one third of the European population that lives in smaller settlements or remote areas, it is of the utmost importance to find tools that will allow us to better design the cities of tomorrow. Economic growth that brings sustainable job creation, social cohesion and enhanced and better quality of life should be a public policy that has to be carried out. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 In the midst of the economic turmoil it is of the great importance to optimise the public resources that we have. Hence, to achieve the goals we have agreed upon it is necessary to invest our resources where they can provide the best possible outcome. Greater integration of the funds and their coordination will surely make them more efficient and help to achieve what the citizens expect. Reducing red tape as much as possible is also crucial.

 Despite the operational shortcomings that have come to light over the years, the Solidarity Fund has proven to be one of the most successful and well-received Union instruments, since it is one of the few instruments available to the Union with which it can demonstrate its solidarity with and closeness to European citizens. The changes in the economic situation of the Union and the majority of its Member States have to be taken into account, the operability of the Fund should be improved without incurring additional costs. Procedures should be clearer, more precise and more transparent. I endorse the need for a clear and precise definition of the concept of disaster, setting a general criterion for assessing the severity of damage caused, and for thresholds to be established geared to the appropriate territorial level. This would help to remove doubts and negative attitudes to the European Union among both Member States and the public, which may otherwise believe that the Union does not offer an appropriate response to their problems. The bureaucracy necessary for the Fund’s mobilisation should be reduced. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 Living in a climate of continual delocalisation and corporate restructuring, it is of the utmost importance that employees have a say and are consulted during these processes.

 Countries located in the Horn of Africa are suffering from one of the most severe droughts of the last 60 years, which has worsened the situation of the most food-insecure regions in the world on account of the region’s poverty and underdevelopment. I welcome all the efforts and humanitarian aid that EU has focused on this region in order to improve basic social services and eradicate poverty. I agree that the European Institutions must remain vigilant and active in the fight against piracy, must be strong in the defence of peace and the promotion of democracy and human rights, and should include ad hoc
 financing lines for the Horn of Africa. I support all the humanitarian aid for civilians. That is whay I voted in favor of this resolution. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 Genetic resources coming from our environment and, in particular, traditional communities around the world, are of great importance to enhance our agriculture and improve productivity. The knowledge that these resources contain may help us better understand many issues that are still without answer in the scientific world. And more, because these resources are a stepping stone for the improvement of current medicines. Clarifying the rules of the game for inventions with their origin in these genetic resources will be good for all the stakeholders involved. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

Mr President, with this reform I think that we are taking a step forward towards addressing one of our citizens’ biggest complaints since this crisis started. Three issues are relevant in this sense: firstly, with this reform we aim to break the link between regulation and credit ratings which has given too much power to the latter.  Secondly, it is good to have a clear calendar on the sovereign ratings of the agencies. It creates certainty for all the stakeholders. However, I am disappointed that the rating agencies are not yet required to spend time physically on the location rated. Thirdly, I support the idea that the Commission will produce a report on a public rating agency, but I would like it to be a foundation with a public-private partnership in order to enhance its credibility. After three different approved laws in the last few years, I hope that this new reform is going to be the one that lasts. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,

 Madam President, how to take care of public finances to make them sustainable is the main political and economic issue of this decade. To achieve this objective the main groups of this Parliament believe that spending cuts are more effective than tax rises if they are growth oriented. This report also remarks the great importance of raising new revenues through fighting tax evasion, which is very high in some of the European countries. Moreover, there are two very interesting ideas that I would like to remark on now: first, this Parliament states that regions without any responsibility on the revenue side, only funded through central government transfers, are more prone to fail in their fiscal consolidation efforts. This kind of financing for regions far away from real fiscal federalism is bad for everyone. In the end it makes regions spend more than their real resources enhancing deficits and subsidies; this is the case of Spain today. Secondly, ministries and sub-sectors of government without concrete powers should be eliminated. It makes no sense to achieve fiscal consolidation efforts in our social services while they maintain useless bureaucracy. For instance in Spain, why do we need a health ministry, an education ministry, a culture ministry when all competences in these fields are in the hands of nationalities and regions? Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, vorrei infine ringraziare l'onorevole Pallone per tutto il suo grande e buon lavoro. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 Today the European Parliament gave its green light to the new regulation governing the allocation of slots at EU airports, aiming at increasing airport capacity and decreasing delays. The text provides several new elements to the existing allocation regime. Firstly, a secondary trading market for slots has been introduced. This measure will allow airlines to adjust their slot portfolios according to their operational needs, while guaranteeing a proper use of the slot and enhancing the development of airport infrastructures and services.  These exchanges must take place under the close supervision of airport coordinators, so that the procedure for the sale or purchase of a slot complies with the rules and with maximum transparency. To ensure the process, the coordinators’ full independence is key to strengthening the slot allocation system and its transparency.  Another innovative element is constituted by the provision of a more incisive and effective sanctions regime against the so-called ‘bad users’, i.e. those carriers operating air services without a corresponding slot or when the use of the slot differs significantly from the scheduling period of the slot.

 I welcome the vote on Noise but I as I stated since the beginning, in my view: The Right of Scrutiny introduced in this process was essential to ensure that the balanced approach is used to identify the most cost-effective measures as intended. Without this measure, all stakeholders are exposed to the possibility of rushed, arbitrary, or discriminatory selection of mitigation measures.  Since the beginning, I feared that there was some misunderstanding about what the European Commission was proposing to scrutinise, precisely the process and not the substance and final local decision. The argument on the possibility for the European Commission to question a compromise reached at local level is not valid. Indeed, the European Commission can only give an opinion on the procedure and not on the nature of the measure adopted. It is the only means to make sure that competent authorities tackle the issue of land-use planning. As a Catalan from Barcelona, you can imagine how much I care about the principle of subsidiarity; however I still believe that the right of scrutiny gives the Commission the ability to provide oversight on behalf of all stakeholders (citizens as well ) and in my view this is a positive element.

 All the regulation that we discuss has to be done listening carefully to everyone. For me, in this case, the scientific point of view was not listened to enough. We cannot regulate on something only because we like it without listening carefully to all sides. Indeed, animal welfare, and in this case, the protection of animals during transport, is important and that is why a very careful scientifically-based approach is needed.

Madam President, today is going to be a great day for Europe, its citizens and their enterprises. After 40 years of negotiations we will have a European patent which is valid in most Member States, thereby easing the path to an enhanced single market. However, Spain refuses to join this great European project. I find it embarrassing that Spain, for petty nationalistic reasons, wants to be out. Because of this, thousands of Catalan innovative enterprises will be damaged by this Spanish exception.  As a Catalan MEP coming from Catalonia, which generates more than 30% of new Spanish patents every year, I find this astonishing. I will support this European patent because by enhancing the single market we enhance our chances of future prosperity. The Spanish Government seems to be providing further rational incentives for more and more Catalan citizens to ask for an independent state inside the EU.

 I welcome Parliament’s approval of this agreement. At a time when our economy is struggling, it is vital that the EU forges stronger links with emerging economies such as Colombia and Peru. Not only will this agreement create jobs in the EU in sectors such as the drinks, car and textile industries but Colombia and Peru will see much-needed European investment into their economy. The human rights situation is improving in Colombia and Peru and we should continue to support the efforts of the Colombian and Peruvian governments on human and environmental rights.

Mr President, I shall now speak in English as my German is not so good. Considering the noise issue, as I have said since the beginning I still believe that the article on the right of scrutiny proposed by the Commission was a positive element and has been misunderstood. I understand, however, that this is a very highly political matter for many of the Austrian and German colleagues here in this House, but the Commission was proposing to scrutinise the process, not the substance and final local decision. Without this measure, stakeholders are exposed in my opinion to the possibility of rushed arbitrary and discriminatory selection of mitigation measures.  Regarding the amendments tabled, I support the four amendments tabled by the EPP and S&amp;D Groups – Amendments 44 and 48 (identical) and Amendments 45 and 49 (identical) – on Article 1 and Article 2. These amendments reintroduce the idea that the economic cost should be taken into account and we, as Liberals, have supported it since the beginning. These amendments improve the current text.  It should, however, be noted that Amendments 45 and 49 still, in my opinion, incorrectly reflect ICAO’s balanced approach. The wording ‘minimising noise’ means that house insulation projects or land use planning could potentially not be included, as these do not ‘minimise noise’ but address a ‘noise problem’.

Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank our rapporteur, Ms Podimata, for doing a good job. The debate on whether Europe should have a financial transaction tax seems to have been overtaken by events. Realising that it was impossible to move on this all together, a group of Member States have decided that they will do it themselves. I think that it is legitimate and in accordance with the Treaties to do this through the enhanced cooperation procedure. Very often in Europe we stop going forward because a small group of Member States refuses to integrate more. As I am deeply in favour of a stronger and more integrated Europe, the use of enhanced cooperation can only be good news for me. Moreover, the decision of the Member States is a consensual and democratic one. As long as impact assessments are done to ensure that no harm will come to non-participating Member States, I think that this Parliament should give a green light to the procedure.  What would citizens from these twelve Member States say if we blocked their democratic will to have a common FTT? As a liberal, I think that we have to live and let live. If twelve Member States want to go forward along the FTT path, let it be. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

Mr President, last week the Spanish Government launched a new education law that represents an attack on the Catalan language. The proposal tries to change the status of the Catalan language in Catalan schools to make it only of preferential knowledge, instead of its current status as the main working language.  Catalan political parties representing 80% of the vote in the last Catalan elections completely reject this proposal. Teachers’ associations, the unions, schools and even the Catalan Church deplore this proposal to marginalise the Catalan language in schools. Even the Dean of the Universidad Complutense of Madrid, José Carvillo, has today supported the present system, with Catalan as the main working language for kids in school. The Spanish Government seems to be giving rational incentives for more and more Catalan people to ask for an independent state inside the EU. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– Mr President, five weeks ago there was a large demonstration in Barcelona. More than one million people demanding that Catalonia be the next EU Member State is exceptional. This is why the President of Catalonia, Artur Mas, has decided to initiate a political process calling for early Catalan elections next month. This process will enable Catalans to decide freely, peacefully and democratically if they want to become a new Member State of the European Union. The will of the Catalans is to remain in the European project. We believe in Europe, and our objective is not to be an isolated country but to become a new partner in the construction of Europe. The example of the agreement on a Scottish referendum in 2014 is an enlightening one. I hope that in Catalonia a new era for European democracy is being opened. Vice-President Vidal-Quadras’s statements calling for intervention by the Spanish armed forces in Catalonia are disgraceful. He should resign. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 Though there is still a lot of legislative work to do in the structural response to the crisis, this European Council meeting has been positive because it has set down the basis for fiscal consolidation and growth. In my opinion, the proposals regarding the establishment of an integrated financial framework and European banking supervisor are also positive because that will bring stability for European banking in the future. I also support the statement by Heads of State on reinforcing single market governance. I welcome the draft proposal for an Economic and Monetary Union, presented by Presidents Van Rompuy, Juncker, Barroso and Draghi, and I hope that they move on from ideas to action, in order to make Europe stronger.

The aim has always been to introduce a level and open playing field to develop a genuine European railway area comparable to what the EU is trying to achieve in the air with the Single European Sky. The challenge was to open up markets, limit discrimination practices, and remove both regulatory barriers and physical bottlenecks to competition across the EU Member States. Today, Member States receive a clear message: implement this directive fully and stop the status quo in Europe.

Although I note that there are several doubts about eCall, such as coordination, data protection, public and private added value services, possible false alarms generated by eCalls, etc., I can only see the positive points of it, namely, that it ensures automatic notification, faster arrival of emergency teams and that the call is made without encountering any language barrier in any EU country.

– In the context of deep recession in some parts of Europe, it is important that in addition to the much needed structural reforms to make our economies more competitive, we take the time to think of how to attract more foreign investment into our continent.

An approach based on one size fits all is doomed to fail. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,

– Mr President, the Liberals and Democrats have worked for more than a year on this request to achieve a really effective single European railway area. We have worked in a constructive, positive and pragmatic way, and we will vote in favour of this final compromise. We have reached an agreement which is not one hundred per cent what we wanted. However, it took a lot of work to achieve this, and for me it is an acceptable package. In the negotiations with the Council, we Liberals and Democrats had to give in on the European regulatory body which should be responsible for breaking up the physical and regulatory barriers that still exist in the European Union. Today, these barriers still remain at national level, preventing and blocking the free movement of trains between some European countries. Instead of this, we have accepted the network of national regulatory bodies chaired by the European Commission. We hope it is a first step to having effective European supervision. We have also achieved in this request more transparency of financial flows in integrated companies, greater independence for national regulators, five years for the multiannual contractual agreement and more opening of the market. I therefore recommend that you support the agreement reached in the second reading. I also ask you not to support the request for a Polish line exemption, in order not to delay this request. I hope that, after the vote in favour of this request, Commissioner Kallas will present, as promised, the fourth railway package, which should include the requirement for more separation, more opening of the market and, hopefully, the European regulatory body. Mr Kallas, compared with the national status quo, in the Commission we trust. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 At this time of severe economic turmoil that is affecting the eurozone as a whole and particularly some Member States, we have arrived at a turning point. I believe we need to push forward – step by step but firmly – European policies that will favour a better European single market that will boost the economic wealth of the region. That is why I support all those actions which follow this line. Coordinated collective bargaining to be strengthened at the EU level should always benefit the workers and thus the EU-based companies, so as to have a more balanced and competitive and productive EU. That should go hand in hand with greater flexibility for the regions or states in implementing the policies, as the EU is diverse and has different political cultures. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– The European market with more than 500 million citizens is the biggest in the world, bigger than the USA or Japan. That gives us more political power and strengthens our position as a soft power in the world in negotiating with third countries under better conditions. Having said that, it is important for me to use this tool to better implement what we think is better for third countries – democracy, freedom of the press or greater separation of powers – while opening up our markets to their products. That, of course, should not be against our industry and agricultural activity, which should be protected to compete on an equal footing with third countries.

What is more, the European redemption fund has been adopted.

And not only at European level, negotiations should be at a global level. That is why the negotiations that will take place in New York in July 2012 are very important. We will take an historic step forward if there are positive results, such as better transparency, national systems and internal controls, eradication of illicit markets which can be used for terrorist acts, and common standards on the import and export of conventional arms. For all these reasons, I will vote in favour of this motion for a resolution Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– The situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo is still a long way from democracy. There is a lack of respect for human rights, many activists and journalists are suffering abuse and repression, there are a lot of displaced persons and refugees because of the conflict, there is no independent judicial and media system, there is discrimination against women and it seems that the last electoral process was marred by a lack of transparency and credibility, due to the numerous irregularities and cases of fraud detected. The DRC deserves a better future. Building a democratic society requires, above all, strong political will. Because Congolese politicians are quite open to dialogue and to listening to European values, I will support this motion for a resolution. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,

– Mr President, tomorrow, the ‘two-pack’ will be voted in plenary. After six months of negotiations, we may have a strong Parliament position. We will vote on new rules on enforcing control of Member States’ finances but also on instruments that may help us out of this crisis. I am talking about the European Redemption Fund, an instrument that combines fiscal discipline and European solidarity, which are not contradictory terms. It is our responsibility to show the world that our single currency is irreversible, and that we are not ready to go back to national currencies. In this respect, the European Redemption Fund is the only realistic and achievable debt mutualisation instrument that we can get in the short run. The European Redemption Fund is a voluntary, temporary and partial debt mutualisation tool strongly related to fiscal discipline. Eurobonds will be for the next crisis, not for this crisis. Talking to our citizens about eurobonds as if they were something for next month is populism. We cannot lie to our citizens, ignoring the fact that convergence in fiscal discipline and in a common fiscal stability culture is needed before eurobonds. On the other hand, doing nothing could also be morally unacceptable. While some countries are financing themselves without cost in the short run, other countries are rapidly becoming insolvent due to the increasing cost of their new debt issues. This is why I call on all Members of this Parliament who believe in the European project to vote in favour not only of the two reports, but also of the European Redemption Fund.

– I will support all the initiatives that promote the development of social solidarity, civic values, community management, social inclusion and combating discrimination. Whereas volunteering is an informal learning experience, where you can join people of all ages, all Member States should make an effort towards developing and financing volunteering programmes and activities. As volunteering can only bring positive things to society, there should be no borders that can limit this activity. That is why I will vote in favour of this report. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– Whereas information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the Internet environment are an important part of our lives, users need to have confidence in the security of the system, as regards privacy of data and intellectual property rights.

I will support all the measures that the Commission and the Member States are taking in order to protect critical infrastructure from cyber attacks. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

− I celebrate the effort and results that our President Schulz got on his visit to Ukraine and welcome the positive predisposition of Ukrainian authorities to accept the proposal of EP, such as sending medical experts to assess the health condition of imprisoned Ms Yulia Tymoshenko and sending an internationally well-respected person to monitor the second trial of the former Prime Minister. The mutual trust between the European Union and Ukraine can only be based on democratic freedoms, transparency, the fight against corruption, respect for human rights, and the unconditional immediate release of all prisoners sentenced on politically motivated grounds. Ukraine has to find the way to carry out these reforms to converge with European values, norms and standards. For all these reasons I will vote in favour of this motion for a resolution.

− I signed and support this resolution because it is intolerable that today in Europe we still experience violations of freedom of expression, discrimination, racism and violence on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Homophobia is the irrational fear of, and aversion to, male and female homosexuality and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people based on prejudice, and it is similar to racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and sexism. The European Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, and must respect and uphold and promote these values. I therefore clearly welcome this resolution to stress these principles once more. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

− Youth unemployment is probably, with our high level of debt, one of the biggest problems we have nowadays in Europe. In Catalonia, where I come from, more than 50% of people under 25 are effectively without a job and not studying. This is a disastrous situation for our societies that see how one of the better educated generations in our history has little chances to join the labour force for the foreseeable future. I support thus this resolution, and I want to specially point out the importance of paragraph 19, where the European Parliament calls on the Commission to prioritise the redeployment of the EUR 82 billion still unused from structural funds into fighting youth unemployment. I hope that the Commission takes this idea very much into account. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

− I cannot understand how, even today, we still have to call for equal pay for equal work for women in the EU. Somehow I feel ashamed to have this report in the agenda today. We all have mothers, wives, sisters, daughters, friends... we know them, we know how they work, how well they work and we know their competitiveness and efficiency, which is even higher than men in many cases. But unfortunately statistics show that women across the European Union earn on average 16.4% less than men in the EU. The difference is higher for unqualified women. I hope this will be the last time that I have to vote for gender equality in this Parliament. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– Mr President, whether the FTT should be applied in Europe has been under discussion for years. Now it seems that this Parliament, at least, is going to support it. I consider that the FTT would be better applied at global level, but I understand the practical difficulties of achieving such an objective nowadays. However, the way the FTT is implemented is fundamental to whether or not it will succeed. Government bonds and pension funds, in my opinion, should be exempt from it and the savings of our older citizens should also be protected. I hope that this will be taken into account in the trialogues. I believe that the low tax rates under the FTT will mean that it does not provoke an exit of the financial industry from the countries that apply it. In the interests of pragmatism, and because of the extraordinary times in which we are living, the Catalan Liberal Party, which I represent, will support this FTT. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE
),  
in writing. 
– I have voted in favour of the FTT as I think it is an important tool to raise revenues that eventually could become an own resource for the EU budget, diminishing its dependency on transfers from Member States. I think the rate is low enough in order not to create a real disruption on financial markets. Moreover, pension funds will be excluded, so the savings of our elderly will not be subject to the tax. I also think that government bonds should be excluded from the FTT, and I hope that the trialogue with the Commission and the Council will reach a favourable conclusion in this regard.

– At first, China was a competitor against European companies because the low cost of production there made its goods more affordable, and therefore many jobs were eliminated in the European Union. Later, however, there came a new opportunity for European companies that are now settled in China. It is true that there are still many areas for ongoing improvement, such as the development of industrial cooperation in the green economy, addressing China’s lower social, environmental and human rights standards, and increasing the flexibility of the yuan, in order not to create artificial trade advantages for China. China and the EU both know that we need each other in our economic relations, and we both know that we can derive mutual benefit from that situation. It makes no sense to be in constant competition. For all these reasons, I will vote in favour of this report. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I think it is an important step for our Parliament to have the possibility to engage on public investigations of relevant issues for our citizens.

– Although this is minor legislation, I welcome that it includes my suggestion to bring 1 and 2 cent coins into the political focus, as their social impact is quite low and may cost more than they are worth. The impact assessment will provide for a more thorough analysis on their issuance in order to decide on their viability in the future. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– The enhancement of the single market is, for me, one of the key policy developments at European level. The implementation of best practices into all Member States will not only create a level playing field but also increase their competitiveness vis-à-vis the rest of the world. I support this resolution as I am very much in favour of building a stronger scoreboard to oversee the actions of Member States that fail to transpose or comply with European legislation. The case of Spain is, in that sense, an example of what should not be done. The Late Payments Directive has been widely violated and has worsened the crisis in Spain by destroying thousands of jobs and enterprises due to late payments from the public administration.

– The situation regarding women’s rights and gender equality in Turkey has been improving – particularly over the last 5 years – but not as quickly as we would have wished. Full gender equality has therefore not been attained yet. It is something that will only be attained when the mentality of Turkish society, and chiefly of Turkish men, changes completely. I agree with the rapporteur that the first initiatives should be taken by politicians and the media, but obviously there is a lot of transversal work to do, and it is important to make a special effort on education, in the labour market and in penal legislation, because all violence against women has to be punished without exception. The Turkish Government should adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards violence against women. With Turkey a candidate country, I will give a vote of hope to Turkish women and encourage its government to adhere to the gender aspect of Europe 2020. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I very much welcome today’s vote on the future of regional airports. As a Catalan with an important ‘regional’ airport like Barcelona and other minor ones such as Lleida, Girona and Reus, I believe that the role of such airports should be recognised fully. However in these times of severe economic crisis, I would like to underscore the importance of cost-benefit analyses when constructing new regional airports in Spain, as public investments should display a certain relationship between the amounts of money spent and the number of passengers using these airports. I strongly believe that regional airports should not be tools to enhance public deficits and should be economically sustainable in the mid-term. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– As a democrat, I have always said that more transparency means better democracy. I voted in favour of these amendments and this discharge because they tend in that direction. The Committee of the Regions has a long way to go, so it is our duty to protect it and give it more political power as an institution, strengthening its role as a third chamber to represent the European regions effectively at the heart of Europe. This will, at the same time, improve our policy making by promoting a ‘bottom up’ approach. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I have always stuck to the premise that less regulation and better regulation should be our goal when we legislate. Roaming has been a very sensitive issue for many years now, and the prices have been too high for our citizens. Given the importance of having a strong single market to boost the economy, roaming charges should be based on market prices. I voted ‘yes’ to better regulation and better protection for users, as well as the fair charges that service providers deserve. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I have voted in favour of this resolution for several reasons. First of all, because I think it is fundamental to ensure that plant and animal varieties and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals shall not be patentable. Secondly, I am satisfied to see that patenting processes that come from genetic engineering are protected. Thirdly, I see that the resolution includes provisions to ensure that patenting doesn’t hamper innovation and further research. In this sense, giving support to exclude breeding processes from being patentable is a step in the right direction. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– We all agree that there should be a free and safe circulation in national and international maritime routes, a premise that is not being respected by piracy in different parts of the world. As a democrat, I welcome the EU’s efforts to combat piracy and I am especially satisfied because we are taking steps forward to solve the main cause of this situation: piracy exists because there is poverty in many countries. That is why the EU authorities have increased the provision of humanitarian assistance to people in need in these countries, in order to provide the local population with alternative livelihoods through which they can properly sustain themselves. For all these reasons, I will support this joint motion for a resolution. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– Mr President, Bankia will be nationalised this week by the Spanish central government and EUR 10 billion of public money will be used to bail out this bank. Spain’s Prime Minister, Mr Rajoy, has, for many months, repeatedly denied that this would happen in Spain and has refused to bail out some Catalan saving banks such as CatalunyaCaixa and Unnim. However, Madrid’s Bankia will be saved with public money despite its bad management and its close involvement with the bursting of the housing bubble in Spain. This is happening at precisely the same moment as regions are being obliged to cut EUR 10 billion in education and health. The Spanish Government will cut transfers to regions in order to cut basic social services and save a bank that has failed. The Commission should examine this nationalisation carefully. No discrimination between citizens should be tolerated in EU countries. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I very much welcome this public stance of Parliament in favour of eGovernment. As I stressed in my amendments, eGovernment is key to improving the competitiveness of our SMEs and promote innovation.

– Once again, an African country suffers a coup d’état
 that hampers its democratic development and its economic progress. I would like to support this resolution calling for a regional solution, but, at the same time, I am not satisfied with paragraph 4. We have had very little time to study the Tuareg revolt and its declaration of independence, and I do not think it is right to deny them the right of self-government and auto-determination. I know that this revolt has been violent and there remain many unanswered questions, but I would like to say that once democracy and the rule of law are re-introduced in Mali, the Tuareg issue should be tackled, if necessary, with a referendum on the independence of northern Mali.

– I want to show my support for this report. Whilst I am not a fervent feminist, I understand the fact that the worst consequences of climate change will be felt in less developed countries, and that gender inequalities in such countries are a very relevant factor in the equation.

– The strategy for biodiversity is one of the key policies for green growth that we should push forward as one of our main priorities either in the EU, as voted in this dossier, or – I add – in all of the international agreements that we have to sign. In fact, without respecting and protecting biodiversity in the EU, there is no future. The heritage that we will leave to our families is the respect for our environment, and learning about it should be – as mentioned in the dossier – another policy that we ought to pursue without delay.

– Establishing priorities for the upcoming years at EU level has wide-ranging effects, not only with regard to the 27 Member States, but also – and no less importantly – to the rest of our neighbourhood in this interconnected world. Thus, I voted in favour of all amendments and in favour of the report, which is in line with the strategy of taking ambitious and realistic action towards achieving the programme. Responsible economic growth should – in the 21st century – be part of every policy, and not only those related to the environment, in order to ensure that our heritage is respected and that the world is protected for our descendants.

 I voted against the agreement on the transfer of Passenger Name Records because I have some reservations on the use that under the current terms can be given to personal data.

– I agree on the main points of the renewed strategy for the Union’s outermost regions (ORs), which faces some structural difficulties. The points I appreciate the most are the development of synergies between the Research Framework Programme Horizon 2020 and the Structural Funds, the support to small and medium-sized enterprises, and the encouragement of the participation of fledgling units of excellence and increased investment. That is why I am in favour of this report. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I am a Catalan, from a minority nation in Spain which has been discriminated against for hundreds of years and that has always been fighting for freedom and democracy. The Catalan people have been demanding respect for their rights peacefully and constantly, even in the worst moments of our history, the civil war and under Franco’s fascist regime only 40 years ago. I therefore understand and share the fears and problems of all people harassed and oppressed by their own government around the world. That is why, through the tools I have as a Member of Parliament, I think, I try to make the voices of all dissidents and non-violent opposition and the people who stand and fight for freedom and democracy heard as much as possible. I always try to denounce publicly the violations and abuses of human rights that take place all around the world and I call for the European Union to stop ‘business as usual’ in its relations with many authoritarian regimes around the world. That is why I voted in favour of this report. Salvador Sedó i Alabart,

Madam President, today we will vote on a proposal which was created to revise the 2003 directive on the re-use of public sector information. Rules and practices around the re-use of public sector information differ between the new Member States and some of them have still not modified their law. Only a harmonised set of ambitious rules can enable the market to take full advantage of the commercial and non-commercial opportunities that the re-use of public data represents. Opening up governmental data for re-use can have major benefits for citizens, businesses, society and for the governments themselves.  Let me state the main modifications in the report. With this new proposal, we extend the scope to museums, archives and libraries. We also limit the maximum charge that public sector bodies can apply to the marginal cost of disseminating the information. We try to foster the use of machine-readable and open formats where possible, to accelerate the transfer and use of information. The exclusive arrangement for the digitisation of documents held by cultural institutions will not in general exceed ten years, with a regular review in the following years, preventing open-ended contracts.  Last, but not least, the new ruling will introduce an impartial body whose decision will be binding on the public sector body concerned. This body should have the appropriate level of expertise and will review the decision on re-use.  I would like to finish with some data. The EU public sector information market for digital content products and services was estimated to be worth EUR 28 billion in 2008. Opening up data to access has the potential to add EUR 40 billion per year in revenue. The proposed revision aims to correct differences arising among Member States, improve access and ensure effective cross-border use of public sector data, kick-starting the development of new services based on novel ways to combine and make use of such information to stimulate economic growth, which will help us a lot, especially nowadays. I would like to finish by thanking the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur for the good job they did.Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 Mr President, because of the lack of results from the First Railway Package in opening the railway markets, the Commission has presented this Fourth Railway Package. Its objective is to tackle the lack of efficiency and remove barriers to a free circulation of rail transport services. Today the fact is that we still do not have a single railway market in the EU.  Ever since the beginning of the negotiations on the PSO dossier I said that, for Liberals, the status quo was not an option. I stressed that we had to act now. We have to open the market as soon as possible through, for example, mandatory tendering of public service contracts. In my view, this was the only big change towards market opening. As Liberals, we were quite supportive of the initial Commission proposal whose aim was to establish a competitive tendering procedure for public service contracts as a general rule across the EU from 2019. Member States could only continue to award contracts directly up to 2019. However, the rapporteur and the socialist shadow did not share in this pressure for change. Mr[nbsp ]Grosch introduced a retrospective efficiency criterion in order to justify the continuation of directly awarded contracts by the competent authority. According to experts, this is very difficult to measure and control practically, and I do not believe change will come with this system.  I am satisfied with the reciprocity clause. This principle is important in order to limit the distortion of competition in the rail market. This principle should apply not only to Member States, but also to companies from third countries. In general I do not believe that this regulation, amended in this manner, could contribute to the opening and improving of domestic passenger transport. So, as we did in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I will recommend to the Liberals that they abstain in plenary on the PSO dossier. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

Mr President, according to the latest data from the Troika’s report, banking credit to non-financial corporations in Spain is falling again this year at a rate of 11%. At the same time, Spanish banks are increasing lending to the Spanish Government at a rate of 10%. After two LTROs and having thrown billions of euros in state aid to the banks, in some Member States this money is being used to finance government deficits instead of credit to the real economy.  The Bundesbank recently reported that Spanish banks today have EUR 300 billion in Spanish government debt. In 2009 this was only EUR 70 billion. Is this sustainable? I would like to ask Mr Draghi: is the ECB giving incentives to create huge crowding out effects? We do not want Mr Draghi to become ‘Mr Crowding Out’. In the next LTRO, money must not be used to fund government deficits while solvent SMEs in the south of Europe agonise without credit at a reasonable cost. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

I voted in favour and support this year human rights report as this is one of the most important functions, namely to perform an oversight function in respect of the Council’s and the Commission’s performance on human rights policy. This strengthens the European Union’s role as the guardian of human rights worldwide. The European Parliament should continue to be involved in the European Union’s human rights dialogues; this House should monitor and continue to raise issues linked to violations and persecutions of minorities worldwide from Tibetans and Uighurs in China to Montagnards in Vietnam to the Sam Rainsy Party in Cambodia! The EU should increase in its efforts to support non-violent opposition in all authoritarian regimes and stop the status quo and business-as-usual policy with regard to countries which reiterate and continue to abuse human rights!

I welcome greatly the fact that the 2012 Commission Competition Report celebrates and focuses on the EU single market and its 20th anniversary. I share this priority. In fact, a lot remains to be done in several sectors, such as banks, telecommunications, energy, competition authorities and transport, to achieve a non-discriminatory, well-functioning single market in Europe. In this report, I have tried to push for more transparency and collaboration between Parliament and the Directorate-General (DG) for Competition. This DG also needs more human resources to do its job. Regarding the banking sector, there is a clear problem of concentration in some Member States. Despite receiving EUR 1.6 trillion in state aid and public guarantees, the banking sector in Europe is still not working properly. Credit to SMEs in many parts of Europe is scarce and expensive, delaying the return to economic growth in the near term. In Spain, for example, credit to non-financial companies has fallen by 11 % in 2013. There is a huge ʻcrowding out effectʼ: the banksʼ purchase of public debt is expelling credit to the private sector. Regarding the transport sector, we denounce the lack of competition in the European rail market and state aid to national airlines. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,  
rapporteur

Madam President, first of all I want to thank my shadow rapporteurs for all their good cooperation during these months, especially Andreas Schwab and Antolín Sanchez Presedo. Thank you very much for your kind cooperation. I would also like to particularly thank Commissioner Almunia and his team for our constructive work together. I very much welcome the fact that the 2012 European Commission competition report celebrates and focuses on the EU single market and its 20th anniversary. I share this priority. In fact a lot remains to be done in several sectors, such as banks, telecommunications, energy, competition authorities and transport, in order to achieve a non-discriminatory well-functioning single market in Europe. In this report I have tried to push for more transparency and cooperation between the Parliament and DG Competition and I also ask for more human resources for DG Competition in order to do a better job. Regarding the banking sector, there is a clear problem of concentration, in my opinion, in some Member States. After receiving EUR 1.6 trillion of state aid and public guarantees, the banking sector in Europe is still not working properly. Credit for SMEs in many parts of Europe is scarce and expensive, delaying the return to economic growth in the near term. In Spain, for example, credit to non-financial companies has fallen again by 11% during this year. There is a huge crowding-out effect. Banks which are purchasers of public debt are expelling credit to the private sector. Regarding the transport sector, we deplore the lack of competition in the European rail market and state aid to national incumbent airlines. The EU rail market is not functioning properly, due to incorrect or incomplete transposition of Community law by Member States. Too often, incumbent railway operators are protected by their own Member States. In this respect, I welcome the infringement procedures launched by the European Commission in the last few years in several Member States. Regarding state aid to airlines, I understand DG Competition is paying a lot of attention to regional airport subsidies to Ryanair, but we should also make sure that the rules on state aid are applied correctly with regard to national carriers such as Iberia, Alitalia and others. Rules should be the same for all actors and we should not accept the ‘too big to fail’ doctrine for airlines. European citizens should not be the ones who always end up paying. I also think the Commission should investigate the 1 000 bilateral agreements in various Member States in the air transport sector that restrict competition by imposing, for example, the requirement that any flight between two countries must stop in a given airport. In Spain, for example, 23 bilateral treaties oblige planes to stop only at Madrid airport. On the energy sector, this Parliament is asking to fully investigate the demand effect. Why is fuel so expensive on some days and so cheap on others? I believe it is not the consequence of market forces and my guess is that some sort of cartel is behind it. To solve all this, we need independent competition authorities and we need their reports to be completely non-political, otherwise we keep on supporting a system which, although theoretically in favour of competition, in practice protects the oligopolies. Finally, on the Google case, I have two questions for the Commissioner regarding the procedure. Does the Commission believe that the adoption of Google’s proposals as they stand will effectively address the Commission’s concerns about fair competition and protect consumers? If not, will you finally send a statement of objections to Google in order to impose truly significant remedies, once and for all? I call on the Commission to take our report fully into account and to act in the coming months. Thank you very much for your kind attention and I look forward to your comments and answers.

I would to stress once again my concerns over the situation of credit to SMEs in Europe. As the crisis deepens, credit to the real economy continues to fall and to be more and more expensive. Not because of the financial situation of the SMEs, but because of their location inside the eurozone. This situation has to be tackled as the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is de facto broken. Another distortion is created by the fact that some banks receiving state aid use this money to buy more sovereign debt when at the same time they reduce the credit to SMEs and households.

I abstain on this MFF because there is not enough cash to finance projects with European Added Value based on cost benefit analysis. I am afraid that funding for the Mediterranean Corridor, for example, will be too small. Moreover, if there are no own resources, the European budget will continue to be a puppet for the interest of 28 Member States and cost-efficient programs important for citizens will be forgotten. I want it to be remembered that Article 311 of the Lisbon Treaty states clearly that the MFF should be funded only by own resources. It is a pity that the Council refuses to implement it.

I welcome the agreement on the Multinational Financial Framework (MFF), and the budget for the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). We would, of course, need more money in order to realise all of the 30 core priority projects by 2030. I really hope the resources agreed in the deal on the MFF will allow us to achieve some of the aims identified: hopefully those with most European added value and based on a cost-benefit analysis! The new EU infrastructure policy aims to create a real network and no longer focuses on isolated projects. The new regulation provides for deadlines to make sure that all projects contributing to the core transport network are implemented as a priority. Let us hope that the dates of 2030 for the core network and 2050 for the comprehensive network are met. From the beginning I have welcomed recognition of the need to reinforce the EU transport network, in particular by filling in missing cross-border links between Catalonia and France and removing administrative and technical bottlenecks caused, for example, by factors like the different railway gauges that exist in Spain. I would like to stress once again the need to focus on European added-value projects, and most importantly the need for a detailed cost-benefit analysis for every project on the table.

I would like to stress once again the need to focus on European added-value projects, and most importantly the need for a detailed cost-benefit analysis for every project on the table.

Madam President, as a Catalan member of the European Parliament, I welcome the agreement on the TEN-T Network and transport financing under the Connecting Europe Facility. The port of Barcelona will be included tomorrow, for the first time ever, in the map of European railway and flight transport priorities, which was not the case in 2003. Ten years ago, the Spanish Government of Mr Aznar and the People’s Party (PP) excluded all the Mediterranean ports from the European network. I hope this will not be the case tomorrow.  I also think that we need more money in order to realise all the core priority projects by 2030. I really hope the resources agreed in the deal on the MFF will allow us to achieve at least some of the projects identified. Hopefully, these will include the ones with capacity to create the highest added value for the European economy such as, in my opinion, the Mediterranean corridor.

In 2003 the Spanish Government only proposed one train to the Commission: that was the train through Madrid, Zaragoza and the Central Pyrenees. I am not against that corridor but feel that the ports of Valencia, Tarragona and Barcelona, the ports of the Cantabrian Sea and also other Mediterranean ports, were excluded from that network. So I am pleased now that all these ports will be included in the priority network, along with the Aragon Pyrenees route originally proposed. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

I voted against the second part of Amendment 160 because the current text excludes Catalan as one of the languages that workers may know in order to satisfy the recognition requirements.

Madam President, the rise of violent extremism is not only a Greek question. In Spain the threat of fascist groups against democratic and peaceful movements is also growing. On 11 September this year these groups attacked the Catalan Delegation in Madrid, injuring one MP and some representatives of European and international diplomacy. The radicals even used tear gas against the people, but the sanction imposed by the Spanish courts has been only a EUR 300 fine. This violent aggression happened the same day that about 2 million people held hands, forming a 400 kilometre human chain in Catalonia, asking peacefully for the right to vote on an independence referendum, as the Scottish will. Last week the leader of a legal party which harks back to Franco stated on Spanish TV that no part of Spain would separate without blood being spilt. He has not yet been detained by the police, and the Spanish government has not made any statement on this issue. I sent links to these videos to all Members of this House last week. There should be sanctions against statements like these in Europe. The quality of European democracy and the freedom of its citizens is at stake.

Mr President, Commissioner Reding, colleagues, this Wednesday, 11 September, is the national day of Catalonia. This Wednesday there will take place in Catalonia a huge and passive demonstration, which we call the Catalan Way. More than one million people will hold hands in a 400 km-long human chain, asking for independence and for the creation of a new European state: Catalonia. It will be the biggest demonstration for decades – a human chain inspired by the Baltic Way 20 years ago. We Catalans want to decide our own future; our dream is to be able to vote peacefully and democratically to decide our own future. Catalans want and hope to do the same as the Scots, who, thanks to the democratic spirit of the British Government, will vote in an independence referendum. Let Catalans vote!

Mr President, today I abstained on the vote on the multiannual financial framework agreement for two basic reasons.  The first is that this is a budget directed at subsidies and not at growth. Europe needs more economic integration, not more transfers. As a Mediterranean Liberal, I ask for this. The Council has applied big cuts to the TEN-T network, fundamental to the Mediterranean corridor and other infrastructures for freight transport. The EU budget should not be perceived to be merely an automatic cash machine for Member States.  The second reason is the concept of ‘no representation without taxation’. Without own resources Parliament and the Commission will always dance to the music of the Council, i.e. the Member States. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,

Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and all my colleagues for the very good job that they have done. As a Parliament, we only have a consultative role on the financial transaction tax (FTT). However, our vote is important to give a signal to European citizens, in the sense that we are asking for a European FTT that some Member States have been implementing on their own account. I am in favour of the FTT as a tool for better regulation of the financial markets, not to hurt or destroy them. This is why I have presented amendments to achieve various exceptions in order to keep the real economy as unaffected as possible. In this respect I particularly welcome the exemption for SMEs voted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs two weeks ago. European SMEs are today too dependent on bank financing and, in a credit crunch context in some Member States, it is fundamental to make it easier for SMEs to access financial markets. It is also very important that government bonds only pay half the tax. The FTT should not increase the interest rate spread of countries and regions. Finally, the cost of the FTT for pension funds was reduced to a quarter. However, I do not think that pensioners should be taxed by the FTT so this is why the Liberal Group will ask tomorrow for a full exemption of pensions. In summary, I think that this Parliament can give a strong signal in favour of an FTT that taxes speculation and protects the real economy as much as possible. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,

Madam President, colleagues, Commissioner and President Draghi, welcome to this Parliament. You said last summer, President Draghi, that the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro, and that was enough. The markets believed you. Yes, it was enough, and you saved the euro, the stock markets and the public debt markets and you became the man of the year. However, President Draghi, now the situation is worsening and now we risk losing Europe. In your last speech at the European Council you also recognised that in some countries, bank credit to the real economy is falling sharply. We do not have monetary union if competitive SMEs in some Member States have to close because credit is scarce and falling; we do not have monetary union if SMEs in some Member States have to close because they pay between 4 and 8% more for a loan than similar SMEs in other parts of the euro zone, and this difference has become structural. The reality is that money has gone from the ECB to the banks to buy public debt. Now, some insolvent banks and states are full of liquidity, but thousands of solvent SMEs are closing because of the lack of liquidity. It seems that the euro is more a currency board than a currency union. This is why the Liberal Group asks the ECB to create a programme to provide securitised loans to SMEs. This could restore the broken monetary policy transmission mechanism. What do you think, Mr President? And a final question: a year ago this Parliament approved, with a large majority, the European Redemption Fund as part of the Two-Pack: a partial and temporary mutualisation of public debt conditioned to fiscal discipline. But the Council used its veto. Some sort of eurobond would give the message to the financial markets that the euro is irreversible, and maybe the OMT programme would not be needed. What do you think?

Mr President, this report is important because it is one of the few in which the Commission has considered the importance of the regional level in the European Union.  I think that the Commission should be more involved in regional statistics, in order to have a clearer picture of what happens in Member States. In Spain, for example, there is no transparency law. Citizens cannot know the territorial distribution of public expenditure by the Spanish central Government. There is also no territorial information about tax collection, which remains centralised. This lack of transparency of the Spanish State is one of the main reasons now fuelling pro-sovereignty feelings in Catalonia. This is why I, in particular, welcome the annex to this regulation. The annex reflects that there should be an analysis of the inter-dependence of regions and Member States. That is why the Liberal Group will support this report. We wish to thank the rapporteur, Sharon Bowles, and all the MEPs, for their good work. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE
). -  
Mr President, in the context of the European Semester, we have to continue with deep reforms and fiscal consolidation. The euro zone debt is not the US debt, and we cannot print money as the Americans do.  In Spain, the central government has imposed public deficit targets on the regions that make no economic sense. A 0.7% GDP target for regions is totally unfair. Regions provide public health, education and welfare state services. At the same time, the Spanish central government continues to build high-speed trains and increase military spending. This year, Spain is allowed to have a 4.5% deficit that should be fairly shared between central and regional governments, as the European Parliament voted last month in the public finances report. However, the Spanish central government wants to keep 85% of the margin allowed by the European Commission, even though the central government represents only 50% of total public expenditure in Spain. I have a question for Commissioner Rehn. Do you think that Spain’s public deficit target is fairly shared between the different levels of government? Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 How to take care of public finances to make them sustainable is the main political and economic issue of this decade. And to achieve this objective, this Parliament believes that spending cuts are a much more effective strategy than tax rises, particularly if they are growth-oriented. This report also highlights the great importance of raising new revenue through fighting tax evasion. Moreover, there are two very interesting ideas that I would like to draw your attention to: First, this Parliament will state that regions that do not have responsibility on the revenue side and are funded only through central government transfers are more prone to fail in their fiscal consolidation efforts. Second, ministries and sub-sectors of government without concrete powers should be eliminated, as it makes no sense to make fiscal consolidation efforts in our social services while we maintain useless bureaucracy.

 With this reform of the Credit Rating Agencies Regulation, I think we are taking a step towards addressing one of the chief complains of our citizens since the crisis started. Three issues are relevant in this context. Firstly, with this Regulation we aim to break the link between regulation and credit ratings, which has given too much power to the latter. Secondly, it is good to have a clear calendar of the sovereign ratings of the agencies. Thirdly, I support the idea that the Commission will produce a report on a public rating agency, but I would like this to be a foundation with a public-private partnership, in order to enhance its credibility.

 Spain has the highest youth unemployment rate (56.5% in September 2012 informs Eurostat) of the EU.

Although I am conscious of the different difficulties of the implementation of this measure, I will be following the application of the Youth Guarantee schemes in all Member States, especially in Spain.

 The European Union has been playing a leading role in the world on green energies and we have to ensure that it will continue doing it.

 I have supported this very good report of Mrs Goulard as I am of the opinion that it is time to put on the political agenda the issuance of some kind of common debt.

 All the tools at our disposal are needed for sustainable economic growth. In this case, as well, we have to rethink how we can better use the public funds available to our cities. I am in favour of pushing forward the necessary public policies that it has been determined will diminish the pain of the turmoil that is affecting our cities and at the same time will help to construct a better society. As most people live in cities, and without acting against the interests of the one third of the European population that lives in smaller settlements or remote areas, it is of the utmost importance to find tools that will allow us to better design the cities of tomorrow. Economic growth that brings sustainable job creation, social cohesion and enhanced and better quality of life should be a public policy that has to be carried out. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 In the midst of the economic turmoil it is of the great importance to optimise the public resources that we have.

 Despite the operational shortcomings that have come to light over the years, the Solidarity Fund has proven to be one of the most successful and well-received Union instruments, since it is one of the few instruments available to the Union with which it can demonstrate its solidarity with and closeness to European citizens. The changes in the economic situation of the Union and the majority of its Member States have to be taken into account, the operability of the Fund should be improved without incurring additional costs. Procedures should be clearer, more precise and more transparent. I endorse the need for a clear and precise definition of the concept of disaster, setting a general criterion for assessing the severity of damage caused, and for thresholds to be established geared to the appropriate territorial level. This would help to remove doubts and negative attitudes to the European Union among both Member States and the public, which may otherwise believe that the Union does not offer an appropriate response to their problems. The bureaucracy necessary for the Fund’s mobilisation should be reduced. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 Genetic resources coming from our environment and, in particular, traditional communities around the world, are of great importance to enhance our agriculture and improve productivity.

To achieve this objective the main groups of this Parliament believe that spending cuts are more effective than tax rises if they are growth oriented.

Moreover, there are two very interesting ideas that I would like to remark on now: first, this Parliament states that regions without any responsibility on the revenue side, only funded through central government transfers, are more prone to fail in their fiscal consolidation efforts. This kind of financing for regions far away from real fiscal federalism is bad for everyone. In the end it makes regions spend more than their real resources enhancing deficits and subsidies; this is the case of Spain today. Secondly, ministries and sub-sectors of government without concrete powers should be eliminated. It makes no sense to achieve fiscal consolidation efforts in our social services while they maintain useless bureaucracy. For instance in Spain, why do we need a health ministry, an education ministry, a culture ministry when all competences in these fields are in the hands of nationalities and regions?

 Today the European Parliament gave its green light to the new regulation governing the allocation of slots at EU airports, aiming at increasing airport capacity and decreasing delays. The text provides several new elements to the existing allocation regime. Firstly, a secondary trading market for slots has been introduced. This measure will allow airlines to adjust their slot portfolios according to their operational needs, while guaranteeing a proper use of the slot and enhancing the development of airport infrastructures and services.  These exchanges must take place under the close supervision of airport coordinators, so that the procedure for the sale or purchase of a slot complies with the rules and with maximum transparency. To ensure the process, the coordinators’ full independence is key to strengthening the slot allocation system and its transparency.  Another innovative element is constituted by the provision of a more incisive and effective sanctions regime against the so-called ‘bad users’, i.e. those carriers operating air services without a corresponding slot or when the use of the slot differs significantly from the scheduling period of the slot.

 I welcome the vote on Noise but I as I stated since the beginning, in my view: The Right of Scrutiny introduced in this process was essential to ensure that the balanced approach is used to identify the most cost-effective measures as intended. Without this measure, all stakeholders are exposed to the possibility of rushed, arbitrary, or discriminatory selection of mitigation measures.  Since the beginning, I feared that there was some misunderstanding about what the European Commission was proposing to scrutinise, precisely the process and not the substance and final local decision. The argument on the possibility for the European Commission to question a compromise reached at local level is not valid. Indeed, the European Commission can only give an opinion on the procedure and not on the nature of the measure adopted. It is the only means to make sure that competent authorities tackle the issue of land-use planning. As a Catalan from Barcelona, you can imagine how much I care about the principle of subsidiarity; however I still believe that the right of scrutiny gives the Commission the ability to provide oversight on behalf of all stakeholders (citizens as well ) and in my view this is a positive element.

 All the regulation that we discuss has to be done listening carefully to everyone. For me, in this case, the scientific point of view was not listened to enough.

Madam President, today is going to be a great day for Europe, its citizens and their enterprises. After 40 years of negotiations we will have a European patent which is valid in most Member States, thereby easing the path to an enhanced single market. However, Spain refuses to join this great European project. I find it embarrassing that Spain, for petty nationalistic reasons, wants to be out. Because of this, thousands of Catalan innovative enterprises will be damaged by this Spanish exception.  As a Catalan MEP coming from Catalonia, which generates more than 30% of new Spanish patents every year, I find this astonishing. I will support this European patent because by enhancing the single market we enhance our chances of future prosperity. The Spanish Government seems to be providing further rational incentives for more and more Catalan citizens to ask for an independent state inside the EU.

Mr President, I shall now speak in English as my German is not so good. Considering the noise issue, as I have said since the beginning I still believe that the article on the right of scrutiny proposed by the Commission was a positive element and has been misunderstood. I understand, however, that this is a very highly political matter for many of the Austrian and German colleagues here in this House, but the Commission was proposing to scrutinise the process, not the substance and final local decision. Without this measure, stakeholders are exposed in my opinion to the possibility of rushed arbitrary and discriminatory selection of mitigation measures.  Regarding the amendments tabled, I support the four amendments tabled by the EPP and S&amp;D Groups – Amendments 44 and 48 (identical) and Amendments 45 and 49 (identical) – on Article 1 and Article 2. These amendments reintroduce the idea that the economic cost should be taken into account and we, as Liberals, have supported it since the beginning. These amendments improve the current text.  It should, however, be noted that Amendments 45 and 49 still, in my opinion, incorrectly reflect ICAO’s balanced approach. The wording ‘minimising noise’ means that house insulation projects or land use planning could potentially not be included, as these do not ‘minimise noise’ but address a ‘noise problem’.

Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank our rapporteur, Ms Podimata, for doing a good job. The debate on whether Europe should have a financial transaction tax seems to have been overtaken by events. Realising that it was impossible to move on this all together, a group of Member States have decided that they will do it themselves. I think that it is legitimate and in accordance with the Treaties to do this through the enhanced cooperation procedure. Very often in Europe we stop going forward because a small group of Member States refuses to integrate more. As I am deeply in favour of a stronger and more integrated Europe, the use of enhanced cooperation can only be good news for me. Moreover, the decision of the Member States is a consensual and democratic one. As long as impact assessments are done to ensure that no harm will come to non-participating Member States, I think that this Parliament should give a green light to the procedure.  What would citizens from these twelve Member States say if we blocked their democratic will to have a common FTT? As a liberal, I think that we have to live and let live. If twelve Member States want to go forward along the FTT path, let it be. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

Mr President, last week the Spanish Government launched a new education law that represents an attack on the Catalan language. The proposal tries to change the status of the Catalan language in Catalan schools to make it only of preferential knowledge, instead of its current status as the main working language.  Catalan political parties representing 80% of the vote in the last Catalan elections completely reject this proposal. Teachers’ associations, the unions, schools and even the Catalan Church deplore this proposal to marginalise the Catalan language in schools. Even the Dean of the Universidad Complutense of Madrid, José Carvillo, has today supported the present system, with Catalan as the main working language for kids in school. The Spanish Government seems to be giving rational incentives for more and more Catalan people to ask for an independent state inside the EU. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– Mr President, five weeks ago there was a large demonstration in Barcelona. More than one million people demanding that Catalonia be the next EU Member State is exceptional. This is why the President of Catalonia, Artur Mas, has decided to initiate a political process calling for early Catalan elections next month. This process will enable Catalans to decide freely, peacefully and democratically if they want to become a new Member State of the European Union. The will of the Catalans is to remain in the European project. We believe in Europe, and our objective is not to be an isolated country but to become a new partner in the construction of Europe. The example of the agreement on a Scottish referendum in 2014 is an enlightening one. I hope that in Catalonia a new era for European democracy is being opened.

Europe has to take advantage of its special historical and cultural characteristics and, at the same time, promote SMEs and allow regions to develop their own policies to attract investors. An approach based on one size fits all is doomed to fail. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group. 
– Mr President, the Liberals and Democrats have worked for more than a year on this request to achieve a really effective single European railway area. We have worked in a constructive, positive and pragmatic way, and we will vote in favour of this final compromise. We have reached an agreement which is not one hundred per cent what we wanted. However, it took a lot of work to achieve this, and for me it is an acceptable package. In the negotiations with the Council, we Liberals and Democrats had to give in on the European regulatory body which should be responsible for breaking up the physical and regulatory barriers that still exist in the European Union. Today, these barriers still remain at national level, preventing and blocking the free movement of trains between some European countries. Instead of this, we have accepted the network of national regulatory bodies chaired by the European Commission. We hope it is a first step to having effective European supervision. We have also achieved in this request more transparency of financial flows in integrated companies, greater independence for national regulators, five years for the multiannual contractual agreement and more opening of the market. I therefore recommend that you support the agreement reached in the second reading. I also ask you not to support the request for a Polish line exemption, in order not to delay this request. I hope that, after the vote in favour of this request, Commissioner Kallas will present, as promised, the fourth railway package, which should include the requirement for more separation, more opening of the market and, hopefully, the European regulatory body. Mr Kallas, compared with the national status quo, in the Commission we trust. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 As a father and EU citizen I believe that we should push forward all policies to protect the most vulnerable citizens of the EU, in this case food for infants and young children. It is my belief that all public or private actions to accomplish this objective must be backed, step by step, and, of course, with all the actors being implicated. Nonetheless, sometimes big steps are needed to better achieve our goals. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 At this time of severe economic turmoil that is affecting the eurozone as a whole and particularly some Member States, we have arrived at a turning point. I believe we need to push forward – step by step but firmly – European policies that will favour a better European single market that will boost the economic wealth of the region. That is why I support all those actions which follow this line. Coordinated collective bargaining to be strengthened at the EU level should always benefit the workers and thus the EU-based companies, so as to have a more balanced and competitive and productive EU. That should go hand in hand with greater flexibility for the regions or states in implementing the policies, as the EU is diverse and has different political cultures. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 I am horrorized about how many women are affected for genital mutilation every year all around the world and it is very worrying the amount of young europeans that have the risk of undergoing this procedure every year. Even though we say women, we refer to children when they suffer this injury, and therefore, they have no option to defense themselves. And is not only about a medical reason, is about the integrity, respect, security and physical and mental health of that women. Is the respect for human rights for that women. I will support all the initiatives that this Parliament is taking to stop this irreparabe and violent abuse. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

 The problem of the defective silicone gel breast implants made by French company PIP is the opportunity we have to do it better in the future. It has been proved that controls at national and European level have not worked properly, so let’s change them! in order to guarantee better safety controls and avoid fraudulent marketing. I agree that is urgent to revise the Medical Device Directive and that is why I will vote in favour of this motion for a resolution. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– The European market with more than 500 million citizens is the biggest in the world, bigger than the USA or Japan. That gives us more political power and strengthens our position as a soft power in the world in negotiating with third countries under better conditions. Having said that, it is important for me to use this tool to better implement what we think is better for third countries – democracy, freedom of the press or greater separation of powers – while opening up our markets to their products. That, of course, should not be against our industry and agricultural activity, which should be protected to compete on an equal footing with third countries. All initiatives that go in the direction described above, which give more power to the EU to protect and defend our living standards in the rest of the world, should be backed. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I have voted in favour of this legislation as I am satisfied with the final text we achieved during the negotiations. It strengthens the economic governance framework of the EU and continues to frame in our legislation the utmost importance of fiscal discipline, and enhances surveillance for those countries experiencing financial assistance. I am satisfied also by the major role for the Commission and Parliament’s increased participation in the surveillance process. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE
),  
in writing. 
– I am very much pleased to say that I have voted in favour of this report. Besides reinforcing fiscal discipline and European coordination, it includes some ideas that I have pushed forward like making all Member States put in place independent fiscal councils to audit public budgetary execution, undertaking cost-benefit analysis on all reforms and investments projects. What is more, the European redemption fund has been adopted. This was the key issue for me, as it is a realistic instrument to mutualise part of the debt from Member States and make the euro an irreversible currency. To put in place the ERF is fundamental to solve the debt crisis. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE
),

– Speaking as a European and Mediterranean Member of the European Parliament, the extension of the geographic scope of the EBRD to the southern and eastern part of the Mediterranean is more than welcome. Given the work that has been done by the EBRD and the need to enhance economically this geostrategically important part of the south and east of the continent, continuing the work should be a priority for everyone, as it is for me. Giving the opportunity to those countries to better reach the socio-economic levels that we have achieved in the western part of Europe will also bring more stability to Europe as a whole and, last but not least, more coherence to our Mediterranean policy. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– From an economic point of view, in general, I have always defended the idea that deepening trade relations with third parties gives more economic opportunities to everyone. If Japan produces certain car components more efficiently that we do in Europe, we should give them the chance to distribute these in Europe so that we, as customers, may benefit. Nonetheless, all this should be based on equal opportunities for both sides, in other words, to the European companies and their skilled workers as well. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– It is somehow strange that nowadays, there is still no global regulation of transfers of conventional arms, which goes against our safety. And not only at European level, negotiations should be at a global level. That is why the negotiations that will take place in New York in July 2012 are very important. We will take an historic step forward if there are positive results, such as better transparency, national systems and internal controls, eradication of illicit markets which can be used for terrorist acts, and common standards on the import and export of conventional arms. For all these reasons, I will vote in favour of this motion for a resolution Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– The situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo is still a long way from democracy. There is a lack of respect for human rights, many activists and journalists are suffering abuse and repression, there are a lot of displaced persons and refugees because of the conflict, there is no independent judicial and media system, there is discrimination against women and it seems that the last electoral process was marred by a lack of transparency and credibility, due to the numerous irregularities and cases of fraud detected. The DRC deserves a better future. Building a democratic society requires, above all, strong political will. Because Congolese politicians are quite open to dialogue and to listening to European values, I will support this motion for a resolution. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group. 
– Mr President, tomorrow, the ‘two-pack’ will be voted in plenary. After six months of negotiations, we may have a strong Parliament position. We will vote on new rules on enforcing control of Member States’ finances but also on instruments that may help us out of this crisis. I am talking about the European Redemption Fund, an instrument that combines fiscal discipline and European solidarity, which are not contradictory terms. It is our responsibility to show the world that our single currency is irreversible, and that we are not ready to go back to national currencies. In this respect, the European Redemption Fund is the only realistic and achievable debt mutualisation instrument that we can get in the short run. The European Redemption Fund is a voluntary, temporary and partial debt mutualisation tool strongly related to fiscal discipline. Eurobonds will be for the next crisis, not for this crisis. Talking to our citizens about eurobonds as if they were something for next month is populism. We cannot lie to our citizens, ignoring the fact that convergence in fiscal discipline and in a common fiscal stability culture is needed before eurobonds. On the other hand, doing nothing could also be morally unacceptable. While some countries are financing themselves without cost in the short run, other countries are rapidly becoming insolvent due to the increasing cost of their new debt issues. This is why I call on all Members of this Parliament who believe in the European project to vote in favour not only of the two reports, but also of the European Redemption Fund.

– I will support all the initiatives that promote the development of social solidarity, civic values, community management, social inclusion and combating discrimination. Whereas volunteering is an informal learning experience, where you can join people of all ages, all Member States should make an effort towards developing and financing volunteering programmes and activities. As volunteering can only bring positive things to society, there should be no borders that can limit this activity. That is why I will vote in favour of this report. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– Whereas information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the Internet environment are an important part of our lives, users need to have confidence in the security of the system, as regards privacy of data and intellectual property rights. This is not only about our personal information; it is also about companies’ information and State security, which must be protected. I will support all the measures that the Commission and the Member States are taking in order to protect critical infrastructure from cyber attacks. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

− I celebrate the effort and results that our President Schulz got on his visit to Ukraine and welcome the positive predisposition of Ukrainian authorities to accept the proposal of EP, such as sending medical experts to assess the health condition of imprisoned Ms Yulia Tymoshenko and sending an internationally well-respected person to monitor the second trial of the former Prime Minister. The mutual trust between the European Union and Ukraine can only be based on democratic freedoms, transparency, the fight against corruption, respect for human rights, and the unconditional immediate release of all prisoners sentenced on politically motivated grounds. Ukraine has to find the way to carry out these reforms to converge with European values, norms and standards. For all these reasons I will vote in favour of this motion for a resolution. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

− I signed and support this resolution because it is intolerable that today in Europe we still experience violations of freedom of expression, discrimination, racism and violence on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Homophobia is the irrational fear of, and aversion to, male and female homosexuality and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people based on prejudice, and it is similar to racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and sexism. The European Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, and must respect and uphold and promote these values. I therefore clearly welcome this resolution to stress these principles once more. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

− Youth unemployment is probably, with our high level of debt, one of the biggest problems we have nowadays in Europe. In Catalonia, where I come from, more than 50% of people under 25 are effectively without a job and not studying. This is a disastrous situation for our societies that see how one of the better educated generations in our history has little chances to join the labour force for the foreseeable future. I support thus this resolution, and I want to specially point out the importance of paragraph 19, where the European Parliament calls on the Commission to prioritise the redeployment of the EUR 82 billion still unused from structural funds into fighting youth unemployment. I hope that the Commission takes this idea very much into account. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

− I cannot understand how, even today, we still have to call for equal pay for equal work for women in the EU. Somehow I feel ashamed to have this report in the agenda today. We all have mothers, wives, sisters, daughters, friends... we know them, we know how they work, how well they work and we know their competitiveness and efficiency, which is even higher than men in many cases. But unfortunately statistics show that women across the European Union earn on average 16.4% less than men in the EU. The difference is higher for unqualified women. I hope this will be the last time that I have to vote for gender equality in this Parliament. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE
).  
– Mr President, whether the FTT should be applied in Europe has been under discussion for years. Now it seems that this Parliament, at least, is going to support it. I consider that the FTT would be better applied at global level, but I understand the practical difficulties of achieving such an objective nowadays. However, the way the FTT is implemented is fundamental to whether or not it will succeed. Government bonds and pension funds, in my opinion, should be exempt from it and the savings of our older citizens should also be protected. I hope that this will be taken into account in the trialogues. I believe that the low tax rates under the FTT will mean that it does not provoke an exit of the financial industry from the countries that apply it. In the interests of pragmatism, and because of the extraordinary times in which we are living, the Catalan Liberal Party, which I represent, will support this FTT. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE
),  
in writing. 
– I have voted in favour of the FTT as I think it is an important tool to raise revenues that eventually could become an own resource for the EU budget, diminishing its dependency on transfers from Member States. I think the rate is low enough in order not to create a real disruption on financial markets. Moreover, pension funds will be excluded, so the savings of our elderly will not be subject to the tax. I also think that government bonds should be excluded from the FTT, and I hope that the trialogue with the Commission and the Council will reach a favourable conclusion in this regard. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– At first, China was a competitor against European companies because the low cost of production there made its goods more affordable, and therefore many jobs were eliminated in the European Union. Later, however, there came a new opportunity for European companies that are now settled in China. It is true that there are still many areas for ongoing improvement, such as the development of industrial cooperation in the green economy, addressing China’s lower social, environmental and human rights standards, and increasing the flexibility of the yuan, in order not to create artificial trade advantages for China. China and the EU both know that we need each other in our economic relations, and we both know that we can derive mutual benefit from that situation. It makes no sense to be in constant competition. For all these reasons, I will vote in favour of this report. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE
),  
in writing. 
– I think it is an important step for our Parliament to have the possibility to engage on public investigations of relevant issues for our citizens. Strengthening the rules in this way will enhance transparency and the role of the European Parliament in a real separation of powers inside the EU. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE
),  
in writing. 
– Although this is minor legislation, I welcome that it includes my suggestion to bring 1 and 2 cent coins into the political focus, as their social impact is quite low and may cost more than they are worth. The impact assessment will provide for a more thorough analysis on their issuance in order to decide on their viability in the future. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE
),  
in writing. 
– The enhancement of the single market is, for me, one of the key policy developments at European level. The implementation of best practices into all Member States will not only create a level playing field but also increase their competitiveness vis-à-vis the rest of the world. I support this resolution as I am very much in favour of building a stronger scoreboard to oversee the actions of Member States that fail to transpose or comply with European legislation. The case of Spain is, in that sense, an example of what should not be done. The Late Payments Directive has been widely violated and has worsened the crisis in Spain by destroying thousands of jobs and enterprises due to late payments from the public administration. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– The situation regarding women’s rights and gender equality in Turkey has been improving – particularly over the last 5 years – but not as quickly as we would have wished. Full gender equality has therefore not been attained yet. It is something that will only be attained when the mentality of Turkish society, and chiefly of Turkish men, changes completely. I agree with the rapporteur that the first initiatives should be taken by politicians and the media, but obviously there is a lot of transversal work to do, and it is important to make a special effort on education, in the labour market and in penal legislation, because all violence against women has to be punished without exception. The Turkish Government should adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards violence against women. With Turkey a candidate country, I will give a vote of hope to Turkish women and encourage its government to adhere to the gender aspect of Europe 2020. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I very much welcome today’s vote on the future of regional airports. As a Catalan with an important ‘regional’ airport like Barcelona and other minor ones such as Lleida, Girona and Reus, I believe that the role of such airports should be recognised fully. However in these times of severe economic crisis, I would like to underscore the importance of cost-benefit analyses when constructing new regional airports in Spain, as public investments should display a certain relationship between the amounts of money spent and the number of passengers using these airports. I strongly believe that regional airports should not be tools to enhance public deficits and should be economically sustainable in the mid-term. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE
),

– As a democrat, I have always said that more transparency means better democracy. I voted in favour of these amendments and this discharge because they tend in that direction. The Committee of the Regions has a long way to go, so it is our duty to protect it and give it more political power as an institution, strengthening its role as a third chamber to represent the European regions effectively at the heart of Europe. This will, at the same time, improve our policy making by promoting a ‘bottom up’ approach. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE
),  
in writing. 
– I have always stuck to the premise that less regulation and better regulation should be our goal when we legislate. Roaming has been a very sensitive issue for many years now, and the prices have been too high for our citizens. Given the importance of having a strong single market to boost the economy, roaming charges should be based on market prices. I voted ‘yes’ to better regulation and better protection for users, as well as the fair charges that service providers deserve. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE
),  
in writing. 
– I have voted in favour of this resolution for several reasons. First of all, because I think it is fundamental to ensure that plant and animal varieties and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals shall not be patentable. Secondly, I am satisfied to see that patenting processes that come from genetic engineering are protected. Thirdly, I see that the resolution includes provisions to ensure that patenting doesn’t hamper innovation and further research. In this sense, giving support to exclude breeding processes from being patentable is a step in the right direction. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE
),  
in writing. 
– We all agree that there should be a free and safe circulation in national and international maritime routes, a premise that is not being respected by piracy in different parts of the world. As a democrat, I welcome the EU’s efforts to combat piracy and I am especially satisfied because we are taking steps forward to solve the main cause of this situation: piracy exists because there is poverty in many countries. That is why the EU authorities have increased the provision of humanitarian assistance to people in need in these countries, in order to provide the local population with alternative livelihoods through which they can properly sustain themselves. For all these reasons, I will support this joint motion for a resolution. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE
).  
– Mr President, Bankia will be nationalised this week by the Spanish central government and EUR 10 billion of public money will be used to bail out this bank. Spain’s Prime Minister, Mr Rajoy, has, for many months, repeatedly denied that this would happen in Spain and has refused to bail out some Catalan saving banks such as CatalunyaCaixa and Unnim. However, Madrid’s Bankia will be saved with public money despite its bad management and its close involvement with the bursting of the housing bubble in Spain. This is happening at precisely the same moment as regions are being obliged to cut EUR 10 billion in education and health. The Spanish Government will cut transfers to regions in order to cut basic social services and save a bank that has failed. The Commission should examine this nationalisation carefully. No discrimination between citizens should be tolerated in EU countries. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE
),  
in writing. 
– I very much welcome this public stance of Parliament in favour of eGovernment. As I stressed in my amendments, eGovernment is key to improving the competitiveness of our SMEs and promote innovation. It may be a great help in reducing public expenditure and achieving fiscal consolidation targets, while at the same time enhancing the quality of services and improving their results. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– Once again, an African country suffers a coup d’état
 that hampers its democratic development and its economic progress. I would like to support this resolution calling for a regional solution, but, at the same time, I am not satisfied with paragraph 4. We have had very little time to study the Tuareg revolt and its declaration of independence, and I do not think it is right to deny them the right of self-government and auto-determination. I know that this revolt has been violent and there remain many unanswered questions, but I would like to say that once democracy and the rule of law are re-introduced in Mali, the Tuareg issue should be tackled, if necessary, with a referendum on the independence of northern Mali. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

in writing. 
– I want to show my support for this report. Whilst I am not a fervent feminist, I understand the fact that the worst consequences of climate change will be felt in less developed countries, and that gender inequalities in such countries are a very relevant factor in the equation. Moreover, I feel that it is of the utmost importance to empower women with regard to disaster management, taking into account the terrible cost in human lives that natural disasters related to climate change produce.

– The strategy for biodiversity is one of the key policies for green growth that we should push forward as one of our main priorities either in the EU, as voted in this dossier, or – I add – in all of the international agreements that we have to sign. In fact, without respecting and protecting biodiversity in the EU, there is no future. The heritage that we will leave to our families is the respect for our environment, and learning about it should be – as mentioned in the dossier – another policy that we ought to pursue without delay. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE
),  
in writing. 
– Establishing priorities for the upcoming years at EU level has wide-ranging effects, not only with regard to the 27 Member States, but also – and no less importantly – to the rest of our neighbourhood in this interconnected world. Thus, I voted in favour of all amendments and in favour of the report, which is in line with the strategy of taking ambitious and realistic action towards achieving the programme. Responsible economic growth should – in the 21st century – be part of every policy, and not only those related to the environment, in order to ensure that our heritage is respected and that the world is protected for our descendants.

 I voted against the agreement on the transfer of Passenger Name Records because I have some reservations on the use that under the current terms can be given to personal data. I think that our citizens have the right to data protection and it is our duty as legislators to work with this goal. Personal data should only be used to fight against terrorism and organised crime, not on other grounds. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I agree on the main points of the renewed strategy for the Union’s outermost regions (ORs), which faces some structural difficulties. The points I appreciate the most are the development of synergies between the Research Framework Programme Horizon 2020 and the Structural Funds, the support to small and medium-sized enterprises, and the encouragement of the participation of fledgling units of excellence and increased investment. That is why I am in favour of this report. Ramon Tremosa i Balcells  (ALDE

– I am a Catalan, from a minority nation in Spain which has been discriminated against for hundreds of years and that has always been fighting for freedom and democracy. The Catalan people have been demanding respect for their rights peacefully and constantly, even in the worst moments of our history, the civil war and under Franco’s fascist regime only 40 years ago. I therefore understand and share the fears and problems of all people harassed and oppressed by their own government around the world. That is why, through the tools I have as a Member of Parliament, I think, I try to make the voices of all dissidents and non-violent opposition and the people who stand and fight for freedom and democracy heard as much as possible. I always try to denounce publicly the violations and abuses of human rights that take place all around the world and I call for the European Union to stop ‘business as usual’ in its relations with many authoritarian regimes around the world. That is why I voted in favour of this report. Salvador Sedó i Alabart,

. – 
Madam President, today we will vote on a proposal which was created to revise the 2003 directive on the re-use of public sector information. Rules and practices around the re-use of public sector information differ between the new Member States and some of them have still not modified their law. Only a harmonised set of ambitious rules can enable the market to take full advantage of the commercial and non-commercial opportunities that the re-use of public data represents. Opening up governmental data for re-use can have major benefits for citizens, businesses, society and for the governments themselves.  Let me state the main modifications in the report. With this new proposal, we extend the scope to museums, archives and libraries. We also limit the maximum charge that public sector bodies can apply to the marginal cost of disseminating the information. We try to foster the use of machine-readable and open formats where possible, to accelerate the transfer and use of information. The exclusive arrangement for the digitisation of documents held by cultural institutions will not in general exceed ten years, with a regular review in the following years, preventing open-ended contracts.  Last, but not least, the new ruling will introduce an impartial body whose decision will be binding on the public sector body concerned. This body should have the appropriate level of expertise and will review the decision on re-use.  I would like to finish with some data. The EU public sector information market for digital content products and services was estimated to be worth EUR 28 billion in 2008. Opening up data to access has the potential to add EUR 40 billion per year in revenue. The proposed revision aims to correct differences arising among Member States, improve access and ensure effective cross-border use of public sector data, kick-starting the development of new services based on novel ways to combine and make use of such information to stimulate economic growth, which will help us a lot, especially nowadays. I would like to finish by thanking the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur for the good job they did.
