 I voted in favour of the strengthening of the rules on the removal of sharks’ fins on board boats. The existing rules permitted exemptions that meant that compliance with the ban on this cruel practice, which involves throwing live sharks back into the sea having removed their fins, could not be guaranteed. While sharks’ fins are the main ingredient in a highly-valued Asian soup, the rest of the meat is less sought-after. There is a great temptation to keep only the valuable part of the shark and to throw the rest of the carcass away, leading to overfishing of an animal of which many species are endangered. However, while the requirement that any fins landed must be attached to the body of the animal should facilitate controls, I remain convinced that the lack of resources allocated to these controls – concerning not only shark finning but also other species – remains the central problem with regard to overfishing, causing harm to the environment and to the overwhelming majority of fishermen, who carry out their work in a responsible and courageous way and face unfair competition that flouts all of the rules.

 I voted in favour of the new certification rules for two-or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles because ultimately they will improve safety for two-wheel users, who are very vulnerable, representing as they do a sixth of deaths on European roads, despite travelling only 2 % of the total distance. Anti-lock braking systems will be mandatory for motorcycles over 125 cc, and the increase in cost should be generally limited by the widespread implementation of this equipment, as has been the case with automobiles. Furthermore, new antipollution standards will be applied gradually between 2016 and 2020. Finally, the entry into force of this regulation in 2016 will signal the end for French motorcyclists of the 100 hp restriction on motorcycles, which has never really proved effective in terms of road safety and could cause insurance cover problems, for example, for a non-restricted vehicle bought abroad.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Monti report’s observation in 2010 was that the rules of the single market were focused primarily on competitiveness and trade in goods, and took no notice of citizens. To put this right, the Commission has presented 50 proposals to relaunch the single market, 12 of them legislative priorities that are currently being examined and are about to be approved. On the 20th anniversary of the single market, which we celebrate this month, the Commission is announcing a new set of proposals for the single market, entitled Act II. These include measures that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has been asking for for a long time, and we are delighted to see them become a reality at last. I refer in particular to the section on social entrepreneurship, cohesion and consumer confidence. I am delighted at the forthcoming improvement of rules on product safety, which is of prime importance for consumers, and at universal access to bank accounts, and the transparency needed on bank account fees. This legislation can demonstrate that Europe protects its citizens, is useful and is not just about austerity policies. The EU has not given up on its social model. We have a duty to maintain this courageous ambition, despite the handicaps. On the other hand, when it comes to Europe being protective and instilling confidence in its citizens, I am slightly more dubious about the proposals on transport and energy networks. I fear that the Commission is still stuck with its ideology of liberalising sectors of the network when we are still a long way from demonstrating the benefits for users, whether in terms of price or quality of services. It seems to me a more pressing issue to respond to the concrete expectations of citizens and consumers with legislation on collective redress, and framework legislation on public services, which we have been asking for for too long. Mr Barroso’s poor communication on public services was clearly not up to the challenge because these services also have a role in the revival of growth in a new industrial strategy. Similarly the Commission is congratulating itself on the potential for mobility that the single market offers citizens. This is to state the obvious, but it would be even better if there were a guarantee that social rights and pension rights would be recognised. The issue of mobility lies at the very heart of the legislation on recognising professional qualifications, on which I am rapporteur. The directive has to and will show that Europe can give real added value to growth, to employment and to its citizens, thanks to smart cooperation between all the institutions and in all the Member States. I am thinking particularly of the major innovation of a European Professional Card. I would like to thank my colleagues for the interest they have shown. We received more than 650 amendments. I know that we will reach some worthwhile compromises, including on sensitive issues like notaries and nurses. All that will remain is for us to persuade the Council to overcome the hesitancy of some Member States, because this is the message we need to give. Yes, the EU can and must be a source of progress and shared wealth to achieve positive, active solidarity between all of its Member States, driven by the same spirit of success from their shared destiny.

This report paints a picture which, regrettably, is hard to deny: we are very far from the goals set in 2004 and 2009. Creation of the Single European Sky is supposed to cut CO2
 emissions by 50 million tonnes and create 328 000 jobs, despite the constraints on growth in the sector as a result of the crisis and increased fuel prices. But, knowing the situation, I am unsure whether it is appropriate to penalise states which do not fulfil their commitments by the cut-off date of December 2012. The introduction of functional airspace blocks is a highly ambitious objective which has implications for national sovereignty and requires the interaction of air traffic control systems that are structured differently and operate differently, so it takes time to ensure a smooth and safe transition. I would be more in favour of incentives, and I think that, before putting forward a new ‘regulatory package’ when this one has not yet been properly implemented, we ought to … wait and conduct some serious assessments.

 The amendments to pharmacovigilance legislation finally introduce the principle of the automatic evaluation of a medicinal product at EU level if the product is withdrawn in a Member State. They also extend the list of drugs subject to additional monitoring. However, the Commission did the very bare minimum after the Mediator scandal. We should remember that its initial proposals on the texts adopted in 2010 were quite simply unacceptable. We had to fight to get rid of measures that were very favourable to the laboratories, making it easier for them to put on the market drugs that had been insufficiently tested with no therapeutic justification in terms of risk and benefit. Unfortunately, these minor changes do not integrate the fundamental measures we had asked for: the financial, hierarchical and intellectual independence of pharmacovigilance activities relating to the industry and medicines agencies, and the implementation of the requirement to demonstrate therapeutic progress in order to obtain a marketing licence. Nonetheless, Ms McAvan’s reports still represent progress in the expectation that a truly ambitious text will be proposed at the earliest possible opportunity. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Single Market Act is to make the market work for citizens again and to bring them and the market together, whilst recognising that an efficient single market can and must give rise to growth and sustainable job creation. Yet, the content of the recent legislative proposals and communications from the Commission show that its concerns are still predominantly focused on the promotion of trade to the detriment of measures aimed at employment and citizens. Some major issues are absent, namely: the promotion of good-quality jobs and rejection of social dumping, safeguarding the social protection model and public services, the portability of social and retirement rights, consumer protection in financial services and the right to collective redress. Parliament must remind the Commission that citizens want and need an innovative Europe that is able to create growth, protect them and also restore their confidence. The resolution that we will adopt tomorrow must send a strong signal in this direction. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, my question is for Commissioner Barnier. Would you mind telling me, please, how much progress the Commission has made with drafting legislation to provide operators in the social and solidarity-based economy with a status? I am referring to mutuals, foundations and cooperatives. These kinds of organisation indeed play a crucial role in cushioning crises and creating jobs and must therefore be protected, supported and encouraged to develop very quickly. Finally, if something concrete is in fact being drafted for the social economy, can we really be content with a simple communication on a quality framework for services of general interest which, in these times of economic and social crisis, also need to be protected by a genuine legal status? Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 – (FR)
 Mr Barnier knows as well as we do, and Parliament and the Commission must work together on this point, just how important this sector is for social cohesion and how much it needs legal certainty in order for social services to be exercised in EU countries. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Mr President, this partnership agreement with Morocco for agriculture and fisheries is an important act concerning a country that has had a shared history with Europe for centuries and is an important trading partner, with which the European Union maintains a net trade surplus. I understand the concerns that have been expressed. Although I have some doubts about certain political hijacking, or exploitation with regard to the rights of the people who are affected but not involved, I also have the same questions about the consequences of the liberalisation on the sectors of activity that are already highly vulnerable. That is why it is essential, Commissioners, to put in place effective compensatory measures to avoid any negative repercussions on European production and jobs. On that condition, I support this agreement because economic expansion in Morocco is an essential lever in consolidating a democratic process that all of us in this House sincerely want to see in that strategic part of the Mediterranean basin.

 Following the example of all the French socialist Members, I abstained on the vote on the Council agreement on the draft intergovernmental treaty adopted by the Heads of State or Government on 30 January. This agreement is not only legally questionable, as it flouts the role of Parliament, but also harmful, because the budgetary restrictions imposed will not resolve the crisis but, on the contrary, can only aggravate the recession. The renegotiation that we are calling for is a logical consequence of that. We must create growth in order to come out of this crisis: this is an economic necessity, and the dogmatic view imposed by Merkozy is not remotely adapted to this. We must restart a virtuous circle by coordinating our economic policies with major joint industrial projects, particularly in the fields of energy and the environment, and by boosting major infrastructure. This can only be achieved through the creation of Eurobonds, which are completely absent from this text, and true regulation of the financial markets, which we have long been calling for. Mr Sarkozy and Ms Merkel’s obsession with strict austerity is becoming dangerous for the whole of Europe. Bernadette Vergnaud,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Pervenche Berès on this outstanding report; it is the culmination of several months of work involving nine parliamentary committees. Thus, in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Catherine Stihler’s opinion emphasised the central role of the single market – the economic pillar of the EU – at the heart of governance focused on the aim of sustainable, inclusive and social growth, in line with the Europe 2020 strategy and in the interests of all our fellow citizens. If we are to take up this challenge, however, we must ensure that the European semester is not just an intergovernmental control system that imposes the diktat of certain Council Members on the national parliaments. Parliamentary consent to the public budget is one of the foundations of democracy. Hence it is imperative that the Annual Growth Surveys be adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure, with the European Parliament and the national parliaments cooperating closely with each other. This is a democratic requirement, and we must stand our ground. Bernadette Vergnaud,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, professional mobility is a key factor for competitiveness and growth in Europe, and is an integral part of the EU 2020 strategy and the Single Market Act. It relates to one of the fundamental rights of the EU: freedom of movement and of establishment. However, it remains limited because we are still lacking simple, clear rules for the recognition of professional qualifications. Repeated tidying-up of legislation does not hide the anachronism of some mechanisms that date back to a time when cross-border mobility was still anecdotal. The fact is that today, 50% of young Europeans are willing to go and work in another Member State, and the new directive will need to take up that challenge. This is a major project. The lack of basic harmonisation of training, the high number of regulated professions and the complexity of the recognition process create legal uncertainty, so much so that this issue accounts for 16% of the complaints made to the SOLVIT network. The main aim is to simplify procedures for citizens, guarantee transparent decision making and reduce delays through better cooperation between competent authorities and between Member States. The classification of economic activities should also be reviewed, because professions and related training requirements are constantly evolving. I welcome the fact that the report focuses on the specificities of the health care professions, due to the implications in terms of patient safety, of course. Finally, I clearly support the creation of a voluntary European professional card system. This type of card should, in particular, facilitate the steps involved and improve consumer and patient safety. Beyond that, this card will help to build a European identity and show that the single market is not only about movement of goods and people, but that it can and should be the basis for economic wealth and shared citizenship. I therefore congratulate Ms McClarkin on this good report, which, I hope, will be widely adopted tomorrow. Bernadette Vergnaud,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, public procurement is a wonderful tool for reviving the European economy, creating quality jobs and choosing more socially and environmentally sustainable offers. To achieve all these things, we have to change our policy of making the lowest price the sole criterion: it is the bedfellow of mediocrity insofar as it obliges public authorities to undertake convoluted procedures in order to choose quality. The report on which we will be voting tomorrow introduces the criterion of the most economically advantageous offer, which enables authorities to demand that tenderers meet high standards. I am grateful to Ms Rühle for having defended this principle so well; it will give operators greater flexibility and greater legal certainty. Another key point is access to public procurement markets, under favourable conditions, by operators in the social economy and small and medium-sized enterprises. European rules are very restrictive for these organisations. They must be improved so that these organisations can respond to major invitations to tender without having to act as subcontractors. In this regard, the very frequent use of this system presents real problems for SMEs affected by tariff dumping and for their employees, who do not benefit from the same pay and social conditions as their counterparts who are employed by large groups. A chain of responsibility must be envisaged. It is unacceptable for main service providers to be allowed to transfer their responsibilities to small subcontractors. I therefore call on you to vote in favour of maintaining paragraph 22, so that employees’ rights are respected and job-creating small businesses are protected in every Member State. Lastly, I am pleased that the Member States have been asked to sign ILO Convention C94 on labour clauses (public contracts). That Convention has been around since 1949, but only 11 Member States are signatories to it. However, I regret that it has not been possible to go further with regard to reciprocal access to public procurement markets in industrialised and emerging third countries. Europe can no longer be the only one to respect the rules, and therefore I ask you to vote against the deletion of paragraph 29. This report is a balanced text, and I call on you not to distort it tomorrow. Doing so would undermine the interests of our industry, our businesses and workers. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

I have declared my support for Mrs Sender’s report as it is not only a major step forward for road safety but also for European citizenship. How can we make motorists understand that they have to obey the rules in their country when they see drivers with foreign plates committing offences with total impunity? It is, above all, an issue of equality before the law. Whilst I can only regret that three Member States have refused to participate, it is a first step towards harmonisation and the objective is clearly road safety, as only serious offences, rather than, for example, parking offences, will result in follow-up cross-border proceedings.

 Following the example of the French Socialist delegation, I voted against the Roth-Behrendt report on EU legislation on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) and on related feed and food controls. It is difficult to understand, 15 years after the start of the mad cow crisis, how we could act as if nothing had happened and how we can envisage putting animal meal intended for ruminants back onto the market, even if subject to strict controls. The current crisis in the livestock sector, linked, in particular, to rising world cereal prices, has to be resolved by regulations at the economic and trade level and by combating speculation, and certainly not by endangering health security.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have been working on this issue for three years now and, in view of the challenges and the huge lobbying efforts of the food industry, I am delighted with the result achieved. I particularly welcome the introduction of mandatory complete nutritional labelling, which will enable consumers to choose healthy products. Allergens will be clearly listed, including for non-prepacked food, and a minimum font size will improve the legibility of information. Mandatory origin labelling for all meat is a real step forward. I hope we will be able to extend it to milk products and to processed fish and meat. It was also essential that alcoholic beverages were not included, Commissioner, because, in my view, they should be subject to specific, specially adapted rules. We could have done better, particularly by introducing legible and harmonised front-of-pack nutritional labelling. However, a major step has been taken toward the civic education of European consumers. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Twenty years after it was introduced, 112 is certainly accessible in all Member States, but only 26% of EU citizens know about it. This is an unacceptable state of affairs, which is why I have fought for Parliament to send out a message to the Commission and to Member States. I therefore welcome the vote on Mrs Rapti’s report calling for improvements to service quality and to the information available about this number. More effective regulation is needed, and it is important that we promote the exchange of best practice and ensure that EU funds are properly allocated. It is essential for automated caller location during emergency calls to be faster, and for the future of 112 to be guaranteed by ensuring the reliability of calls made via Skype. We must also introduce the ‘reverse 112’ automated SMS alert system for use in the event of a disaster. As regards universal service, whilst in the long term the plans are to extend the universal broadband service only, I am delighted in particular with the reminder of service providers’ obligation to abide by EU rules on neutrality on the networks. It is unacceptable that their customers might not be able to access the services, content and applications of their choosing over the Internet. Thank you. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 This vote is important because the Commission has to take the necessary measures to prevent unfair competition and non-reciprocity of access to public contracts in relation to third countries. This is not about erecting protectionist barriers, but the Union can no longer be the only one to play by the rules. Indeed, we can no longer ignore the social and economic dumping practised by companies in emerging countries who are winning contracts in countries of the Union, in defiance of social rights and legislation on State subsidies, while, in the meantime, the markets of these countries are closed to European companies. However we must also not forget that the large industrialised countries, despite signing international agreements, do not play by the rules either! After years of inaction, the Commission seems intent on acting, and that is necessary: the survival of our companies and jobs depends on it. Finally, I welcome the adoption of the amendments put forward by the Group of the Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament with regard to compliance, in the context of public procurement, with working, social and environmental standards in force in the Member States. It is now for the Commission to size up this call. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate all those MEPs who had a hand in drafting these reports. I think that we have managed to produce three balanced texts, which send a strong signal from Parliament to the College of Commissioners about our priorities for a Single Market that operates effectively on behalf of our citizens, for growth and for enterprises. As shadow rapporteurs for Mr Buşoi’s report, we have created a clear road map for the Commission. Firstly, and here we are all in agreement, Commissioner, there is a proposal for a legislative framework for public procurement, public/private partnerships and service concessions which should protect small operators, SMEs and awarding local authorities, and which will guarantee reciprocity between the EU, the industrialised countries and the major developing countries. Then there is the need to ensure that we prioritise the common consolidated corporate tax base and a clear VAT framework. That is crucial if we want our SMEs to flourish within a healthy competitive environment. Finally, we must ensure that innovation is funded, in order to stimulate strong and sustainable growth in major European infrastructure projects, through the creation of Eurobonds. I should like to finish by stressing how important it is, to my mind, that we have reached a satisfactory compromise on the key issues of being able to guarantee social rights in the different legislations of the Single Market and of protecting services of general interest within the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon. Commissioner, we are sending you a very clear message: the economy must be at the service of the citizens, and not the other way round. You need our help. Today, we give you this help, along with a major challenge: that of reconciling our citizens with the European project. So do not let us down and give them the confidence they need!

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mrs Gebhardt, for their work. The Commission’s initial proposal was indeed absurd, as it endangered the level of consumer protection by wanting to harmonise it completely. This is only justifiable so long as harmonisation is upwards and not downwards, as proposed. Therefore I welcome most of the compromises reached, which leave the possibility for Member States to apply stricter rules if they so wish, while guaranteeing a high minimum level for all consumers in the Union. Thus, maximum contract duration is limited to 12 months, information on distance contracts or telesales contracts is improved, with payment being required only when the cooling-off period, set at 14 days, has expired. On the other hand, it is unacceptable to keep full harmonisation regarding chapter V, relating to unfair terms. Not only is the chosen level of protection unsatisfactory, it is also tantamount to ignoring the reality of fraudulent practices, since these require a level of responsiveness that European legislation cannot offer. That being the case, taking away all room for manoeuvre from Member States in this area seems like an irresponsible move. Consequently I hope that the colegislators manage to come up with a balanced text which guarantees a genuine and common core of high-level protection. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 Having been rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament on the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I am delighted with the text that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has adopted, which contains many of the proposals we and other associated committees made. In this respect, I think Edite Estrela’s report is excellent, as it places the emphasis on some of the crucial aspects of our European social and healthcare model: equality of access to high quality healthcare for everyone in Europe, better management of reproductive health, monitoring of the efficacy and quality of drugs through independent pharmacovigilance systems and, above all, the necessity of high levels of public funding for healthcare during this period of economic crisis. Health is not a general good like other goods, and our welfare systems have the duty to ensure that the most disadvantaged have access to healthcare. I am naturally astounded therefore at the votes to remove some of the abovementioned points requested by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group. This step smacks of reactionary neoliberalism, and I hope that the final vote will preserve the spirit of this report and be a credit to this Parliament. Bernadette Vergnaud,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Services Directive was the subject of unprecedented public political debate when it was being discussed in Parliament. Thanks to the efforts to reach a compromise, which were led by Mrs Gebhardt, whom I congratulate, the text that Parliament succeeded in adopting in 2006 was one that reconciled the need to stimulate the internal market in services as a source of potential growth and job creation, and respect for social rights, labour law and the specific nature of services of general interest. In order to maintain this very fragile balance, the directive had to be transposed with the utmost care. This caused problems for many Member States, such as difficulties in implementing the points of single contact and the mutual evaluation process. Right now, I am concerned about and question the choice made by France; it is very much a minority choice and will result in provisions being split up between a whole series of laws and decrees. I also regret the very restrictive interpretation of the concept of authorising the provision of services. It will create legal uncertainty for social services relating to the care of young children and the disabled, even though derogation and exclusion possibilities were provided for in the directive. Parliament is playing, and will continue to play, a full part in monitoring the successful implementation of this directive, which is key to ensuring that the single market creates jobs and is closer to the citizens, and that Europe is experienced on a daily basis as something positive, not something negative. I therefore call on the Member States and the Commission to step up their efforts to guarantee a completely transparent process for European citizens.

Compared to the Commission’s initial proposal, which facilitated patient mobility with a market-oriented perspective on health, I welcome the progress reflected in this agreement. It was essential in order to safeguard our social protection systems that we re-establish a prior authorisation system for hospital or cost-intensive treatment. Similarly, the reference to Article 168 of the Treaty was necessary in order to ensure that the prerogatives of the Member States in terms of organising their public health systems were respected. Finally, commendable progress has been made in terms of cooperation and patient information. There are, however, still major deficiencies: the lack of consideration given to the mobility of professionals, medical demography and the ageing population. Other legislative proposals should remedy this – in particular, the proposal regarding professional qualifications – and in those proposals, it will be important to reaffirm that health is a sector with specific characteristics and not a commodity governed solely by the laws of the market, but rather the most precious asset that citizens have.

 The adoption today in plenary of a budgetary amendment to mobilise the EU Solidarity Fund to the tune of EUR 35.6 million following a proposal by the Commission is good news. This is in response to the request made by the French Government following storm Xynthia, which hit the French coast on 27 and 28 February 2010, leaving 53 people dead and 80 injured in Vendée and Charente-Maritime. The procedure is undoubtedly long and in need of improvement, but I am pleased to see European solidarity being shown in this way, in the face of the tragedy the victims have experienced. I had written to Commissioner Hahn to support the French Government’s request for aid, and he has honoured the commitment he made to me during his visit to La Rochelle in early March. This fund is more than much-needed financial assistance; it symbolises the common values shared by our continent. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by pointing out that I did not believe it right to give our opinion so early on with a vote on the events that took place in Laâyoune on 8 November, when we do not have all the facts at our disposal to give us the necessary hindsight and objectivity. Nevertheless, given these conditions, I am relieved to see that we have reached a relatively balanced and measured joint resolution which takes into account the concept of human rights and which does not unduly condemn either party, even though some points are questionable. In any case, the most important thing I think is not to inflame the situation further so that investigations and negotiations can be conducted in an atmosphere of calm, and so I think it wise not to be drawn into challenging the privileged status of a neighbouring partner country on the basis of partial and often contradictory reports.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a few months after Professor Monti’s report, which called for a necessary recovery of the citizen-oriented internal market, I welcome the Commission’s response. What particularly stands out in my mind is the improved recognition of professional qualifications, aid for SMEs, the new legislation on public contracts and service concessions, and legal certainty for the social economy. I therefore welcome this ambition. However, I regret that, in the 50 proposals, there is no clear definition of priorities. I am worried about the piecemeal strategy of the various Directorates-General and Commissioners and call on Mr Barroso to become more involved in order to avoid contradictory proposals. Finally, I deplore the absence of any real commitment on services of general interest given that, for years, we have been asking for protective legislation, which is now possible under the Treaty of Lisbon. For that reason, Mr Barnier, I am waiting to see the final texts before making my mind up and possibly supporting you in this major challenge for the future of Europe and of all its citizens.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Weiler, on her work and the remarkable compromise achieved with the Council, as the Commission’s initial proposal had some major faults. I would like to go back over four important points achieved in this directive. First, I am very pleased that there is a guarantee in place on equal treatment of the public and private sectors. The Commission was expecting heavier sanctions for the public sector, even though the latter works in the general interest. This was the result of ignorance about the reality of the state of the Member States’ public accounts, and could have resulted in a competitive disadvantage for public companies. Another move forward is the extension of payment terms to 60 instead of 30 days for public health services, which have complex budgetary procedures forcing them to have longer payment terms, for which they cannot be held responsible. Still on the subject of payment terms, it was essential to establish a ban on unfair contractual terms affecting creditors in contracts between companies, which often happens between a large group and a small and medium-sized enterprise. Finally, and this relates primarily to the small and medium-sized enterprises which are victims of payment delays, the introduction of an 8% interest rate in the event of a delay and compensation to cover collection costs could encourage these companies to demand damages. Until now, they have tended to refuse to do so at the risk of this jeopardising anything. I am therefore delighted to be able to vote on this bill which, I hope, will constitute real progress for the viability and good health of European businesses, progress that is needed not only for a more successful internal market, but also a fairer one. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, pharmacovigilance, which involves analysing the side effects of medicinal products and calling for their withdrawal from the market in the event of an alert, incited little interest in the midst of the pharmaceutical package. It is, however, essential to the safety and quality of our health systems and, even though I am delighted to see you, Commissioner, I must deplore Mr Dalli’s absence. I was dismayed by the Commission’s proposals, which jeopardised the pharmacovigilance systems for the benefit of the pharmaceutical companies. Fortunately, thanks to the work of Parliament and the Council, the situation has been improved somewhat. Thus, it will not be possible to generalise advance marketing authorisations for new medicinal products. We can also be pleased with the progress made in terms of transparency. However, I think that this agreement represents a missed opportunity to improve pharmacovigilance and I am concerned, above all, at the lack of guarantees regarding the independence of the system. Thus, even though the role of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee has been strengthened, it is not totally independent of the European committee which grants the marketing authorisation. We know from experience that this committee is loath to go back on its decisions. As for national structures, there is absolutely no provision on the matter. Also, I am sorry that the Member States do not have to report possible conflicts of interest of experts on the European committee. Finally, and this is the most serious point, this agreement endorses the end of the best guarantee of independence: public funding for pharmacovigilance activities, most of which will be funded in future by private fees. I congratulate Mrs McAvan on having improved the Commission’s initial proposal but, as there are a number of problematic issues, I question the point of closing this dossier in a single reading. If we had taken our time, we could have increased patients’ confidence in safe, high quality pharmaceutical products. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

I condemn the ostrich politics of those who think that the European Court of Justice’s current case-law on service concessions is satisfactory and that there is absolutely no need to legislate. For years, the socialists have fought and campaigned to obtain framework directives protecting services of general interest, and there is no question of us abandoning this commitment. The only long-term guarantee for public services is real European legislation, not judicial decisions, however well-founded they may be. As we can see with the difficulties in transposing the Services Directive in relation to social services, only a specific framework can provide legal certainty and quality of service. Small and medium-sized enterprises and local and regional authorities expect clarity and legal certainty in the awarding of public procurement contracts such as social housing public procurement contracts. However, neither did we want to vote against this report, which contains important elements, in particular, as regards social and environmental standards, which we must be able to integrate into tender procedures, recommendations to facilitate SME access, and a clear call for vigilance in public-private partnership contracts.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by expressing my deepest sympathy and solidarity with the victims of the Madeira floods and of storm Xynthia. The necessary questions must be asked about the worrying increase in these destructive meteorological phenomena, and about the role played by climate change and the urgent need to find solutions. For now, it is a case of providing urgent solutions to the populations rocked by these disasters. Of course, public and private insurance providers must be responsive but, when it comes to the destroyed infrastructure and rebuilding the areas concerned, European solidarity must be expressed. That is why the French Government has requested aid from the EU Solidarity Fund, created in 2002, which I hope will be granted quickly and meaningfully. This is the thrust of the two letters that I have sent to the Commission since 1 March in my capacity as an elected representative for the west of France region and which I had the opportunity to discuss, last Thursday, in La Rochelle, with Commissioner Hahn, whom I sincerely thank for being so responsive. Commissioner Hahn agreed that the mechanism was complex and difficult to implement. Well, we have to conclude that it could have been made more flexible if the Council had not incomprehensibly blocked the review of the operation of this fund as adopted by a very large majority of MEPs in May 2006. I therefore hope that the Spanish Presidency will break the deadlock on this text so that the system can be made more effective. In more immediate terms, I call on the Commission to authorise a one­off increase in cofinancing via the ERDF and ESF regional funds for projects in the regions affected, within a time frame that will enable their economies to recover by summer. Lastly, this aid should not be used to rebuild in such a way that the same tragic environmental and town planning mistakes are made; rather, it should be used in a considered way, so as to prevent as far as possible a repeat of such tragedies.

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have the opportunity to mention during a priority debate these three reports concerning citizens’ everyday lives. I would like, moreover, to congratulate our rapporteurs on their work and, more specifically, to mention the SOLVIT network. The network has now been in existence for eight years; it has resolved many problems effectively and yet it is completely unknown. How many times have I had to refer people to this network, the existence of which they did not even suspect, even though this tool could strengthen the image of a Europe protective of its citizens’ rights. I must admit – and I am very glad that Mr Barnier is here – that I understand that my country’s government does not really promote it. The increased number of cases would consequently be very tricky to manage for the sole trainee who, currently in 2010, is in charge of the SOLVIT network in France, a country which, it is true, has only 60 million inhabitants and which is only the second Member State in the EU from the point of view of the number of cases submitted in 2009. Indeed, the resolution rate is amazingly good, but the time periods are dreadful, with an average of 15 weeks before cases are dealt with, which is five weeks beyond the maximum allowed. I would therefore ask the Commission and the Member States to grant real financial and human resources and to conduct major information campaigns, aimed especially at businesses, which submitted no more cases in 2009 than in 2004.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have already discussed the fears linked to the transposition of the Services Directive. In this sense, the example of the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications is symbolic. Some States have failed to respect the transposition deadline and are having problems due to the gaps in the text. Although this directive lays a solid foundation for mutual recognition, the specific characteristics of certain professions have not been taken into account. The fact is, recognising qualifications without having established actual common levels of qualification and training, including for higher education, can only cause complications and create mistrust on the part of Member States, professionals and the citizens. The most obvious example is that of the medical professions. For example, French midwives are authorised to write prescriptions and are trained for that, which is not the case in other countries. What happens when a midwife without such authorisation arrives in France without additional training and has to write a medical prescription? Similarly, certain specialisms do not exist in every Member State. This directive is crucial to the free movement of workers, the foundation on which the European project is based, but it must be improved and enhanced, and the difficulties encountered must serve to identify the professions for which language teaching and harmonised training are necessary. I should like to mention the remarkable initiative, which is supported by all health professionals, to create a European card. This is a genuine guarantee as much for the carrier as for the customer or patient, and I call on the Commission to extend it to other professions, since this will enable us to improve mutual recognition and to gain the citizens’ trust.

 I am delighted to see this lengthy, highly controversial work reach its conclusion; it shows the importance of the telecommunications sector not only as an economic player but also as a vital element in today’s society. Our citizens communicate across borders on a daily basis and our aim was to guarantee quality of services while ensuring that users’ fundamental rights were respected. I want to congratulate Mrs Trautmann and the negotiating team for the compromise they have achieved, making any sanctions taken against users subject to a prior contradictory procedure. Furthermore, the Commission was committed to guaranteeing net neutrality and to combating anti-competitive, discriminatory practices carried out by operators. This agreement will mean consumers benefit from many positive developments which were sometimes the result of tough negotiations. I particularly wish to highlight guaranteed access and localisation for calls made to the emergency number (112); improved access for the disabled; greater information on contracts and billing; warnings in cases of unusually high usage; the introduction of a maximum delay when transferring a customer’s telephone number; and information in cases of security breaches relating to personal data.

Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since its adoption and the heated debates that surrounded it, the Services Directive has somewhat faded into obscurity, but it is important to show that we are particularly vigilant in the crucial phase of its transposition. I question the interpretation of the provisions of Article 2 of the directive linked to the exclusion of social services from its scope. Notions such as ‘support for persons in need’ and ‘mandated providers’ seem restrictive when compared with the definition of social services used in certain Member States, and I am concerned that a deliberately strict interpretation may serve to justify the inclusion of whole swathes of these services in the scope of the directive. The exclusion of these services is a key element of the text and a guarantee for the citizens that the European social model will be protected. I hope that certain Member States, including France, will not take advantage of the transposition in order to liberalise social services, under the false pretext that they are complying with European laws. These problems to do with the integration of services of general interest demonstrate the need to have European legislation that is specific to them and not to stick to a default definition as part of a directive on commercial services.

I voted against Mr Barroso’s candidacy, above all, because I believe in a genuinely political Europe, which cannot be satisfied with a Commission bound by the desiderata of big business. I also believe that one cannot campaign by calling for another form of European leadership only to then give a blank cheque to a champion of liberalism whose programme is sorely lacking in ambition and values. A man who has taken shelter behind the idea of ‘better regulation’ in order to ‘deregulate’ everything that I, as a socialist, defend: public services, social protection of workers, respect for health systems, regulation of the financial economy and protection of consumers and of the environment against the power of industrial groups. Out of respect for my own convictions and those of the electorate, I feel that these values cannot be called into question by ulterior motives and tricks aimed at obtaining derisory concessions from conservatives who control the majority of the Member States, the European Parliament and the Commission, and who will not rest until they have furthered their deregulatory policy.

Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, this summer our Member States reached an agreement on a growth pact. In the autumn, they are foolishly unable to agree on the resources for it. Budgetary discipline is one thing, but it is the citizens who are paying the price of the crisis because of the loss of jobs. They are waiting for policies that promote economic recovery, reinvigorate the internal market and ensure greater solidarity. That is why, like other Members – and I say this straight away to President Barroso – we cannot accept the Commission’s proposal as a ceiling; it is the absolute lowest level to which the European Parliament could sink. The proposals of the Cypriot Presidency, like those of Mr Van Rompuy, are just not enough. They are not enough to enable us to achieve a balance that encourages regional development and regional fairness, between the agriculture and Cohesion Fund policies, for example. They are not enough for a number of activities that guarantee the European Union’s competitiveness, such as industrial policy, research and the Connecting Europe Facility. They are not enough to offer guarantees for young people, access to training, Erasmus funding, or consideration of all young people for lifelong learning, as well as lifelong learning for other groups, such as adults and older people. As Mr Barroso said, that is the fifth freedom. Finally, there are no longer any resources for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund or food aid for the most deprived. Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore ask you to make a real investment in infrastructure, in the economy, and in the future of our young people. Catherine Trautmann,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets
. − Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, among the numerous challenges that the introduction of the European Semester presents, I would like to mention two key aspects. First of all, this mechanism must not simply be an instrument for formal surveillance of budgetary policies between Member States and by the Commission. On the contrary, the European Semester must allow sincere and in-depth collaboration between the European Parliament and national parliaments, in keeping with our respective competences and the democratic principle. It is the only valid way forward with a view to complementarity of national budgetary policies. Secondly, with regard to the European budget: our Parliament, by a massive vote in favour of the Kalfin and Böge report, pointed out that 94 % of this budget was an investment budget. On that basis, I proposed, in my opinion included in the report, exploring the possibility of excluding Member States’ contributions to the EU budget from the calculation of the structural deficit, as defined in the two-pack, the six-pack and the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (TSCG). Our Parliament is conducting the mother of all battles, for a European budget that meets the overall interests of the EU and its citizens. That is the direction of this proposal, addressed both to net contributory and beneficiary States. It would free up budget negotiation. In fact, it would make it possible to leave behind the damaging logic of fair return and the search for rebates and move to an approach based on contribution in the noblest sense of the term. In addition, such a calculation method would make the most of all payments to our common budget, including those made by beneficiaries. Consequently, I ask Mr Gauzès, our rapporteur, to look again at his request, on behalf of the PPE, to remove this proposal. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr Barroso, I think the State of the Union, for us members, is the State of Europeans. Europeans are troubled by three things: financial matters, health and employment. I would have liked to have talked about protecting people’s savings. I would have liked more ambition on the issue of re-equipping our industries through energy, the environment and digital technology. I would also have liked you to show a little more insight. If we are actually going to get out of this crisis, we need a timetable that is appropriate for the efforts of Member States and citizens. I would add, in this respect, that there is no democratic progress without social rights and, on a social level, as some have said, it is still not good enough. We need guarantees in terms of employment, in terms of not attacking the European social model as well as guarantees in terms of the financial and fiscal effort of all those who elect us and who want to regain confidence in the European Union. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, the decision taken in Brussels is a welcome breath of fresh air, and even if there remains a lot to do, the conclusions of this summit mark the end of an era and represent the first stage of a revival for our citizens, that of a Europe that gives itself the means to be fairer and show more solidarity. The issue of growth is no longer taboo and the discussion about the broad economic guidelines is now under way. The European Union will not be able to emerge from the rut of the crisis without breaking the vicious circle of austerity, which could condemn Member States to an endless recession. I am delighted that this sound political sense can at last be found in the conclusions and I am glad that France and its President, Mr Hollande, have contributed to this political rebalancing and are committed, out of solidarity, to the path of integration. However, although hope is essential, full implementation is what will restore confidence permanently. With EUR 120 billion having been mobilised within the framework of the Growth and Employment Pact, and EUR 10 billion of recapitalisation from the European Investment Bank (EIB), these will allow bonds to be issued for the purpose of financing projects. The European Parliament must be heard concerning a coherent financial framework and own resources. The mobilisation of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the launch of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which we would have liked to see granted a banking licence, is the most urgent matter for Spain and Italy, without forgetting the Greek citizens who have been hit hard by the crisis. The quick implementation of a banking supervisor for the euro area is only the first step towards banking union, which Parliament strongly advocates. Moreover, we cannot content ourselves with a limited tax on financial transactions, even if its implementation within the framework of enhanced cooperation could constitute a first step. In this way, we expect a lot from the next European Council, where the group of four – four Presidents, of course – will have to propose an ambitious road map in order to advance economic and monetary union and to enable the definitive resolution of the sovereign debt crisis and the instability of the euro area. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to give our fellow citizens concrete proof of our capacity to resolve the crisis, first and foremost, through growth fuelled by investment. Can you justify, in these times of precarious employment, doing away with the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), which is supposed to support workers who have lost their jobs because of globalisation, especially when we have to reinvent an industrial policy for Europe? Solidarity and insecurity are affecting a new population of young people, unemployed workers, women and pensioners. Yet those same people who were unable to manage this crisis would choose to do away with the European food distribution programme? Mr President, I ask that it be maintained beyond 2013, without doing away with any other essential programmes. The last aspect is cohesion. The regions must not be held responsible for the poor management of the Member States. We reject the strengthening of macro-economic conditionality because, in a time of crisis, we need to be able to adjust the support policies where economic growth is regional and where jobs can be provided. We therefore stand alongside the trade unions and NGOs that are fighting for solidarity, and alongside the regions, which must play a key role in the vitality of the territories in order to promote more growth, employment and social justice. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, Greece has been forced into an endless spiral of austerity and today, these modern-day doctors Diafoirus, these advocates of blood-letting, are refusing to deliver the aid promised. How do we explain this to the Greek citizens who are being doubly punished with pressure and injustice? There are alternative approaches. Let me propose one: the fight against tax avoidance. The tax haven provided by Switzerland costs Greece an estimated EUR 16.4 billion in loss of earnings. Tackling this resolutely would enable Greece to get back on track with the stability pact without sacrificing the future. Greece has been pushed by circumstances into considering a bilateral agreement with Switzerland, similar to the Rubik agreements signed by the United Kingdom and Germany. Executing this partial levy on fraudulent investments, instead of prosecuting fraudsters, is institutional recognition of tax fraud and a bad deal financially. The Union should follow the example of the United States, which has successfully forced Switzerland to provide the bank details of suspected fraudsters. What are the Commission’s plans now that its services have concluded the illegality of these agreements in a note that I believe should be made public? What does it suggest for the future now that its proposed Savings Tax Directive has been buried by the Council and, in particular, by Germany? In short, what does it intend to propose so as to stop constantly penalising the poor? I would like it if the Commissioner could respond because this question is important, but I can see that he has not been listening. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, I am not going to give in to politicking – I want to assure Mr Reul of that – because I believe that this treaty is setting us up for failure and I deeply regret it. I regret it because it is inefficient in its response to the market in the face of the crisis as it does not rebuild confidence. We have seen the problems Greece and Portugal have had in the same period. We are seeing two countries, who are the greatest contributors to our budget, France and Germany, whose growth rates have been halved. We understand that it is the wording of this treaty which, normally, should have served to settle things and reassure everyone, including the people. In reality, it is the action of the ECB which has had a positive effect, by making over EUR 500 billion of liquidities available to the banks. However, in Parliament, we must realise that we have to be consistent. We are elected by our voters; and our voters are the retired people who are in debt, the workers who marched through the streets of Brussels, the unemployed people waiting for work, and the young people who want to have a future. We cannot content ourselves with criticising a treaty which is based solely on fiscal discipline, on penalties, and which, even worse, introduces government by the judiciary to the detriment of the sovereignty of national parliaments. We, the Members of the European Parliament, should rise up against this outcome and put forward proposals. I, for one, have proposals that I should like to put forward. This is not simply about criticising. I believe, Mr President, that what we can propose today for Europe is a virtuous circle, a European pact of responsibility, governance and growth. This treaty must be renegotiated, on a basis which allows for true coordination of economic policies, including industrial projects to provide work for our factories and our workers, projects in the fields of energy and the environment, the creation of Eurobonds, which have regrettably been forgotten about or crossed off the agenda, and financial regulation. We need justice, we need solidarity. That is what we must defend in Parliament. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, the cheers that accompanied this agreement have already stopped. Is anyone surprised? The package offers no immediate solution to the crisis: no pooling of debt via Eurobonds – even though they have Mr Van Rompuy’s backing – and no strengthening of the European Financial Stability Facility or provision of a banking licence to enable it to raise funds via the ECB, which will not intervene in sovereign debt matters. What happened to using the tax on financial transactions as a fair taxation tool and an own resource? Perhaps there is no longer any urgency. After all, Mr Sarkozy, having pushed through two austerity plans in order to maintain France’s AAA rating, declared yesterday that a rating downgrade was not such a big obstacle to overcome. Who are they trying to kid? In the longer term, this agreement will be one of sanctions and fear, and it will put a little more pressure on the Member States, which are already struggling. The austerity policies decreed by ‘Merkozy’ are set to plunge Europe back into recession, and Europeans into unemployment. Where is the solidarity? Where are the jobs and growth? Europe is not a poor Union, but it needs to revitalise its industry, develop its infrastructure and offer its young people prospects for the future. This requires investment, which the Member States and the Union should be helped to finance. This is what justifies revising this Treaty. Any other decision would mean bypassing the national parliaments and the European Parliament and would thus be undemocratic. How can one explain the fact that a future French presidential candidate consulted neither the opposition parties nor his parliament before pledging his country’s signature? That is something that no one can understand or accept. Catherine Trautmann,

Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, during the negotiations on the telecoms package, the European Parliament already advocated the need to respect the Internet’s neutrality. Transparency on how traffic is managed in times of network overload and a minimum quality of service are basic requirements, but the persistent blocking of Internet content, as was just mentioned, or applications shows that these requirements are not enough. Let us therefore remember the essential nature of the Internet for fundamental rights and media pluralism and the need to ensure the confidentiality of communications and people’s private lives. Telecoms operators can contribute to economic recovery. They must be given the opportunity to innovate and invest in the development of new services, but the quality of basic Internet services, with which we are familiar, must not under any circumstances be allowed to decline in favour of paid services. We oppose the creation of a two-speed Internet which would be discriminatory for the most modest-income households, who are already hard-hit by the crisis. Finally, if the findings of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) require it, we would ask the Commission to assume its responsibilities and produce a binding text which ensures the Internet’s neutrality. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, our colleague who has just spoken is right. We need networks, we need an economic development model which gives us a future in every sector. Let us take the case of youth employment. There is no way we can believe in the future and trust policies when youth unemployment is over 15% or 20% and when young people are even denied a first job. I was disappointed by what Mr Barroso had to say. I would have liked practical solutions, for instance, priority access to public procurement for companies that hire young people for their first job. I would have also liked the Commission to present a tailored strategy for development. Yes, we have regions in Europe that are worse off than others. Yes, we have pockets of poverty and, with that in mind, we found out that one Head of State was calling into question the sustainability of the funding for the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union (PEAD). If there is no future for young people, if there is no solution for the most deprived, if there is no development strategy, you have enough resources to carry out social impact assessments, sector by sector, to determine where jobs can be created in companies, industry and services. It is not enough to say or claim that we could guarantee job security; we must ensure that the young and unemployed can access qualified jobs that enable them to find a solution, since without a job, there is no social dignity. How much progress has the Commission made on the Posting of Workers Directive, Commissioner? We have been waiting a long time for the divide between our countries concerning human resources and employees to be removed. I would like and hope to receive specific answers from you and I shall conclude by saying that I am disappointed that Mr Barroso only devoted one hour to a year-long programme that is meant to bring about a sustainable recovery and a permanent resolution to our Member States’ sovereign debt.

 Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, this morning my feelings are both of relief and concern. I feel relieved because at least last night’s agreement exists as we could not risk another failure. The restructuring of the Greek debt takes the European contribution to more than EUR 200 billion, adding together private debts, the euro area stability fund and the public aid plan. The first stage of recapitalising the banks loosens the current stranglehold by increasing own funds. I particularly welcome the increase of the European Financial Stability Facility rescue fund to EUR 1 000 billion, at last, in my view, as the socialists have always believed that this fund was not sufficiently resourced. However, as a European, let me share with you the reasons for my concern, which are serious ones. I fear that all we did last night was to increase our capacity to carry out a patch-up job, and that we neglected the foundations of our common edifice. On reading this agreement, I can see grounds for two major reservations: firstly, its ‘short term’ nature. The measures adopted this morning relate exclusively to finance and in no way provide a long-term solution to the need for economic integration. This morning, the Council responded to the European banking, debt and euro crisis: that was a vital step. However, the lack of prospects for growth and the silence on economic convergence and employment allow some people to continue to speculate about how fragile we are. At a time when we should be carrying out structural reforms to invest in and kick-start growth, we are recommended to opt for the ‘Euro Plus Pact’. We do not accept that. Let us not replace excessive dependency on the market by dependency on competitor nations which do not comply either with social or environmental standards. The second reservation: budgetary authoritarianism, which adds enforcement to austerity. In point of fact, we face two crucial tasks today: to clean up our public finances and to kick-start growth. The balance between these two must be a political choice. It flows from a decision that we make for the people of Europe that we represent. The Court of Justice should not be a substitute for political will and our duty to show solidarity. We must not revise the treaty under pressure from speculators. The choice of further integration is our political duty, and that of this Parliament. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission needs to prove today that the industrial policy it stands for is not an empty promise. As has already been said, we cannot accept that economically viable sites equipped with high-performance tools and skilled employees may be shut down because of a cynical calculation of profits. As far as the Florange site is concerned, I call on the Commission to speed up its selection process for the NER 300 programme, because we must examine all the other options for maintaining activity on European soil. Indeed, this site brings together, under the Ultra-Low Carbon dioxide (CO2
) Steelmaking (ULCOS) programme, all the elements needed to set up a pilot project in the field of CO2
 capture and storage, thereby striking a difficult balance between heavy industry and environmental protection. The fact is, the more blast furnaces are shut down for the long term, the more it will cost to start them back up again, and the greater the risk of this project failing, which would be catastrophic not only for the Lorraine steelmaking area but also, on a wider scale, for all the regions in Europe that are interested in reproducing this kind of equipment. The European Union was born out of steel and steelmaking. We cannot let it disintegrate and perish because of a financial crisis and because of the demise of steelmaking, for the sake of our jobs, our regions and our workers. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, unlike the French Government, I sincerely hope we will have a major public debate. We need comprehensive stress tests. Fukushima has shown that we must imagine the unimaginable. The method currently used fails to take into account risks such as terrorist attacks or plane crashes, and therefore does not meet this requirement. We need a transparent debate, because the choice whether to continue or stop must be based on broad public consensus that is informed but not bypassed by expert discussions. We need an independent debate in the presence of all parties, so as to avoid potential conflicts of interest and promote appeasement. Finally, I am from Alsace and therefore know the extent to which the Fessenheim nuclear power plant concerns our German and Swiss neighbours. Instead of establishing full national control over these issues, why not at least encourage a sharing of expertise between our security agencies? Security would benefit, as would transparency and citizenship at European level. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this very fine report by our fellow Member, Mr Audy, summarises all our discussions with the operators in the sector. I am not going to go over their assessment of our Seventh Framework Programme: that it is indispensable but too complicated and too bureaucratic. I would just like to emphasise two points. Firstly, innovation. Parliament has pledged to promote it, but it must not do so at the expense of fundamental research. As we well know, the main result of research is knowledge, followed by the opportunity to enhance that result in the economic sector, or indeed the industrial sector. A clear distinction must be made, then, between the manipulation and the enhancement of fundamental research. Secondly, financing. We all agree that the budget should match our ambitions. I would go so far as to say that, on this issue, we should be innovative by being consistent. It is pointless bringing in more instruments; let us make the existing ones more effective. In this respect, the risk-sharing finance facility is a real success, but it must take a more inclusive approach to SMEs and research infrastructure. I therefore call on the Commission to do everything in its power to solve the disputes as quickly as possible and to take into account the courses of action proposed in this report. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we set ourselves the objective of strengthening our capacity for innovation and investment or the competitive advantage to be found with the United States and China, we speak of economic development, certainly, but specifically, we also speak of creating jobs. For that reason, we must give ourselves the means to strengthen innovation. I would like to congratulate Mrs Merkies on the one-stop shop, the funding strategy, and the recognition of necessary risk-taking by researchers. Her report points in the right direction and proposes a context that is favourable to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are essential to the success of the European Union. Innovation means attractiveness and competitiveness of the territories, and the involvement of the regional and local authorities is essential in terms of committing appropriations, reducing disparities and enhancing the active role that citizens must play. It is directly on the ground that the measure proposed in this report will contribute effectively to the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives. Catherine Trautmann,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fishermen have told us that it is becoming harder for them to make a living from their work. On top of the particularly painful situation for them of a reduction in fishing quotas and plans for exit from the fleet, there is now the added problem of soaring oil prices. Although the price has fallen slightly, it continues to fluctuate, and for two years now, this situation has been affecting the daily lives of all our European fishermen, in particular, in the small-scale and coastal fishing sector. This situation is extremely worrying, and we are anxious to show fishermen that we are fully behind them. To do so, we call on the European Commission to raise the threshold of de minimis
 aid that can be granted to them to help them cope with this crisis. This is simply a temporary measure, justified by an urgent situation. The Commission already reacted to a similar phenomenon in 2007, and in the face of this new peak, we wish to know what concrete measures – you have already given details of some of them – it intends to take. We also feel it is crucial, as Mrs Fraga Estévez said, to verify that the Member States are using all of the funds currently set aside by the regulation. At a time when the future common fisheries policy appears to be taking shape, I believe that our fishermen are not resistant to change; quite the contrary. Many of them told me that they were willing to make an effort, particularly in terms of preserving stocks. This is, in fact, a collective responsibility. In order to make that effort, they must not fall victim to factors outside their work over which they have absolutely no control. A swift and effective response by you, Commissioner, on this point would send a signal that would also help strengthen what we know are historically fragile links between the Commission and the profession.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to give our verdict at first reading on the draft radio spectrum policy programme, and I should like to thank the Commission for having supported and transformed this proposal, which was first tabled during our debates on the telecoms package. I should also like to commend our rapporteur, Mr Hökmark, as well as my fellow shadow rapporteurs, for our good cooperation on a report which reveals some major political issues hidden behind its highly technical aspects. We have had numerous debates, which have really made me see that Parliament and the Commission do, quite naturally, share the same opinion and ambition. The opinion is that spectrum is a scarce resource that does not recognise borders. Everyone seems to agree on this point. However, it is on the solutions to be found to improve its management and on the general ambition that some differences can be observed, in particular with the Member States, which I do not deny have historically had a certain sovereign responsibility. Although not all the compromises tabled and adopted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy are as balanced as I personally would have liked, I support very sincerely the general move to develop a spectrum management approach that is more integrated, realistic and responsive to the social, cultural and economic needs of our fellow citizens. This is a common thread in all the positions adopted by our Parliament, Commissioner, be it on the own-initiative report by my colleague, Mrs Toia, or on the proposals that I myself defended as one of the rapporteurs for the telecoms package. With regard to the radio spectrum policy programme, my group and I placed particular emphasis on several points in our amendments. They include, therefore, introducing transparency so as to learn how spectrum is currently allocated and managed – that is, the inventory principle – and also finding innovative and original solutions to the electronic communications sector’s growing demand for use of frequencies. They need to be qualitative, not just quantitative, solutions. By emphasising spectral efficiency, we will remedy this situation without limiting the diversity of services available on the spectrum. In doing so, we are also using spectrum as a vehicle for bridging the digital divide and developing new services that are within the reach not only of large telecommunications companies but also of SMEs and start-ups, which will need them. I believe that this economic dimension is essential. To conclude, I should like to say a few words about the next stage. As you said yourself, it was clear from the start that a first-reading agreement was out of the question, but it is imperative that we reach an agreement by the end of the year. This is essential for our public services, for meeting consumers’ expectations, and for developing the Internet regardless of the infrastructure in place. It is also essential for planning the economic recovery of our European Union thanks to this resource. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, nuclear power is a non-carbon energy source, but also a transitional energy source which depends on exhaustible resources. It is also a potentially dangerous form of energy. The obvious priority, after Fukushima, is to take a view on the safety of our power stations. These stress tests must be carried out in the most coordinated way possible at Union level, and potentially beyond in our immediate neighbourhood, by independent entities working in accordance with the strictest standards and with the greatest transparency. Next, the fight against climate change requires a coherent and ambitious policy. While nuclear power means that we can emit less CO2
 into the atmosphere to produce the electricity we need, we must not be dependent on it. In countries such as France which produce nuclear power, reducing its share is a precondition for any far-reaching decision. This process means that we must redouble our efforts when it comes to saving energy and increasing the share of renewables, which, in the medium and long-term, will be able to cover almost all of our consumption. This is about the safety of power stations, but it must also be about the security of provision throughout the European Union, so that no country finds itself in economic difficulty. Finally, true solidarity requires the creation of an Energy Community. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, I thank my fellow Member, Mr Rübig, for asking this question. I think that, actually, the French regulator is independent – his proposals are testament to that. I think that, given the logic of what I mentioned concerning the European Energy Community, we should have an independent regulator at European level and make available the supervisory means to ensure that the regulator’s work is independent and that the regulator is genuinely competent.

Mr President, at national level, it is always possible to question the composition and, from this point of view, I agree with Mrs Lepage’s comment. I think that we will soon see a period in which pluralism can be better ensured, but in any case, I would not want to question the honesty of the work by those people who have taken up their task conscientiously, and one person in particular, Mr Lacoste. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, I would like to thank Bernd Lange for his excellent work. Tomorrow, his collaborative method will be crowned with success. Moreover, Commissioner, this is an opportunity for the Commission, which provided us with a rather disappointing communication. As someone who hails from a large region heavily hit by the crisis, when it had already been affected by industrial restructuring, I have listened to the message of the unions, which have constantly challenged us. We need an industrial policy, all of whose components work towards the same goal: constructing a strategy that is based on sustainable, employment-centred growth that is built around the optimisation of skills and which shows that social and technological innovations are compatible with each other. That is the key to European competitiveness and not the use of the workforce as an adjustment variable, as the Commission proposed in the European semester. The best move the Commission could make is to rapidly integrate the Posting of Workers Directive into the work programme and to begin fiscal harmonisation starting with corporate taxation. Furthermore, this policy should take shape not only at national and European level, but also at local level in the context of an effective cohesion policy. Our choice is a regulated financial market, and we share the desire to consolidate the single market, but not at the expense of an inequitable labour market which is subject to social dumping. Today, Madam President, we are debating an ambitious industrial policy, and this morning, we voted on a tax on financial transactions, and on Eurobonds. Ladies and gentlemen, we must use these means to finance it. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment which is currently being examined by the Lithuanian Parliament and which would make it a punishable offence to publicly promote homosexuality, was drafted within the framework of a law for the protection of minors against the detrimental effects of public information. How can we, supposedly for the sake of protecting minors, undermine both freedom of expression and of information, and, above all, sanction discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation? We know very well that a text of this kind leads to concealing one’s sexual orientation and runs counter to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) rights which we have defended and which this Parliament has defended. Furthermore, at a time when we are witnessing acts of violence and aggression towards homosexuals, this is an incitement to criminalising homosexuality and a call for violence. We cannot give to young people an image of Europe as a society that is closed, intolerant, inward-looking and that disregards respect for other people. For us, therefore, this law is in complete contradiction with European values, as contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. As has been said, it also goes against the whole antidiscriminatory corpus of Union law, which has greatly contributed to making our national laws more egalitarian in many aspects of everyday life from employment to information or education. I thank you, Commissioner, for making a very clear statement, and I would like all groups to understand your argument as well as that of my fellow Members. I would like to call upon all fellow Members from all the political groups to join with the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&amp;D), the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), the Greens/European Free Alliance (Verts/ALE) and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL), who have taken the initiative in drafting this resolution. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, the euro is our common asset and, today, the trade unions told Parliament that they were concerned that employees themselves were paying the price for the crisis through a weak euro, a euro under attack and not through a growth-promoting, job-creating euro. It is therefore essential that we do not pursue a simple technical revision of the treaties and that the two major dysfunctions of the euro area revealed by the crisis are addressed. The first approach is to introduce eurobonds, as we have heard. Eurobonds will not only stabilise the level of the euro, they will also immediately counter the speculative attack. The second approach to introducing fiscal justice and to making the financial market pay the price for the crisis is precisely to introduce a tax on financial transactions so that it is not employees who, as a result of fiscal injustice, pay the price for this crisis. Finally, a European debt agency must be established, which must be able to pool some of the sovereign debt of the Member States. Finally, I would also like to support Mr Juncker and to say that increasing the stability fund, which was proposed by Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Director-General of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is a good idea. Early intervention – as we have heard – not being late and choosing to become strong and not weak would enable us to perform an act of governance that would re-introduce the confidence called for by our President, Martin Schultz. (Applause) Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, my group, in fact, wishes to see the two oral questions concerning both the report of the Van Rompuy task force and the six Commission legislative packages on economic governance reinstated in the order of business. Firstly, for an institutional reason, since Article 9 of the Treaty of Lisbon gives us this prerogative and this authority to have applied the horizontal social clause and, in particular, the study on the social impact for the sweeping measures, the sweeping directives and decisions that have consequences for our citizens. Mr John Monks, the General Secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, has just written about his concern at seeing austerity plans having a direct impact on the incomes of wage earners, their wages and also their pensions. The political reason for making this request, Mr President, on behalf of my group, is that we must show that, at a time when we are discussing market regulation, we are not only giving our verdict on the markets, but also voting and legislating in favour of our fellow citizens. I should like to see this House feel able to support the reinstatement of these oral questions. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, this work programme presents the recovery of growth and jobs, as well as economic regulation, as key to restoring confidence. That is true. Our model of economic development can no longer make do with strengthening the enforcement aspect of a Stability Pact that has continually shown its limitations. The recovery of growth must be centred on job creation throughout the Union in its entirety. We need to look at employment and social standards as indicators of economic power and, from that point of view, emphasise the need to put more thought into the European tax on financial transactions and into a greater coordination between the European Union and the European ministers for employment, as well as into the Union’s economic proposals. I support the Members who took the floor to highlight the importance of the directive on the posting of workers and on the services of general interest. I think that the European Union’s digital strategy is a crucial factor for this new economy. We should show more recognition of the Commission’s ambition on this point. With regard to citizenship, the Union should put the citizens back at the heart of the European project, and the increase in financial allocations should not only focus on security aspects, in particular, on managing migratory flows. Finally, I would end, Mr President, by saying that, in essence, this work programme for 2011 should be the very example of a policy that addresses in a positive way this temptation for nations to withdraw, which all our Member States are experiencing. I believe the European Commission has the power to change things. It can rely on a Parliament which will be a proactive force and will support it if it shows more ambition. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, the state of the Union for us today, in France, is that the citizens, the people, and also the streets are rumbling with discontent. Our fellow European citizens are experiencing an unprecedented crisis of confidence, and they have decided to march to the beat of refusal and demands, but also of hope. What is behind this is a failed proposal for reforming pensions, but not only this. What is at stake is getting older in a dignified manner. What is at stake is ensuring an intergenerational solidarity which allows the youngest people today also to live their working life, their professional life, with a pension from which they can benefit. On this very subject, Mr Barroso, the Commission published a Green Paper on the reform of pension systems which unleashed a wave of anxiety from the trade unions before the summer. The proposal that you have made to increase the retirement age seems unrealistic to me. It would be more useful if the Commission told us how we can make sure that workers are able to keep their jobs up to the legal retirement age. I would like to hear your proposals, and I would also like to hear some details on what you called the fiscal consolidation rather than the economic coordination of our Member States, which I think must be oriented towards social solidarity. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, I would like to congratulate our fellow Member Mr Cadec on his excellent work. The text put to the vote today marks a certain change in the way our institution views the concept of free trade. Without being protectionist, the line defended here may be described as less naïve. We all agree that European production is insufficient, and rather than immediately resorting to imports, we must first try to intensify our efforts to safeguard and regenerate stocks, including through the use of aquaculture, to ensure the sustainability of the sector and its jobs in the Union, as well as European fisheries that are less dependent on third countries. As for imports, we must guarantee that the European market in fishery and aquaculture products does not suffer unfair competition as a result of less strict health and social conditions and ludicrously low tariffs. That is why I favour a European label, in accordance with our standards, both environmental and social. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, you told us earlier that Europeans must be firm and united if they are to succeed at the G20, and that the European Union’s credibility on the international stage is at stake. However, what is at stake, above all, is the Union’s credibility in the eyes of its citizens, who expect it to be able to equip itself with credible instruments to exit the crisis. Firstly, I expected the conclusions of the European Council of 17 June to treat EU budgetary discipline, macro-economic surveillance and the regulation of financial services equally. It has to be said that this was not the case. Secondly, having clearly lacked internal solidarity in the face of the crisis, the European Union has a duty to lead the efforts to emerge from it. Let us be frank. Economic and monetary union is suffering from a structural fault, which creates an imbalance between monetary policy and economic policy, even though today, the euro accounts for 27% of the global reserves of central banks. That obliges the Member States and the Eurogroup to coordinate national economic policies. The euro must not be the symbol of high prices for our fellow citizens, and our duty today, at the end of these interim Councils, is no longer to simply reassure the markets. It is to reassure citizens of our ability to exit the crisis together. Thirdly, the tougher stance on budgetary discipline, at this time of crisis, must not aggravate the recession. We want evidence, evidence that the 2020 strategy will actually be accompanied by financial resources that are sufficient to develop, but also guide, the economy towards the spending of the future, towards employment and towards solid and fertile investments. Presidents, we must hear the warning being expressed today in anger and soon in fear. Identified as it is with unfair liberalism, the European Union must not become the symbol of brutal austerity. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, may I congratulate Mr Romeva i Rueda, who has managed to include the technical provisions resulting directly from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) meeting in Recife, as has already been said, while leaving open the possibility of adding further rules that might arise from forthcoming negotiations. This report also includes elements that will enable us to combat the phenomenon of illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing, and provides guidelines as regards stock regulation. I particularly support the report. Our vote is taking place at a fairly fraught time, following the European Commission’s decision last week to close purse seiner bluefin tuna fishing early. While a common ground appears to have been found – and for that I would like to acknowledge the step taken by Commissioner Damanaki, who reached an agreement with France, allocating additional quotas for small-scale and coastal fishing – there is still some doubt over the situation concerning purse seiners. The constraints faced by fishermen are very strict, and it is this kind of uncertainty that we must avoid, for our fishermen have to be sure they have a stable and level playing field. It is this objective of predictability that we will pursue in negotiations on the reform of the common fisheries policy. Predictability and sustainability must go together, particularly as regards decisions necessary for safeguarding stocks and the sector’s long-term future, as well as fishermen’s activity and income in the short term, with the objective being a fisheries sector that respects marine resources. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us say this clearly: the way in which the negotiations on the Anti­Counterfeiting Trade Agreement are being carried out is unacceptable to the European Parliament. As a new colegislator on this issue, the Treaty of Lisbon now guarantees us the right to full information at the same time as it is received by the Council. The documents that have ‘leaked out’ up to now have proved to us that, as far as form is concerned, this dimension absolutely was not respected. What can be said about the content? The fool’s bargain that seems to have been offered to Internet access providers is as follows: should they decide to cooperate in the systematic monitoring of the content carried on their networks, their current non­liability for such content would be maintained. Otherwise, they would be exposing themselves to legal actions by right holders and would be systematically penalised. I find such a turnaround extremely dangerous, as it would call into question the acquis communautaire
, not only on the principle of mere conduit – referred to in French as simple transport 
– in the e­Commerce Directive, but also in relation to respect for the fundamental rights of the citizens, which was brought up recently in our debate on the Telecoms package. I will conclude by reminding you that our Chamber has already shown its attachment to these principles by rejecting the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) Agreement. I have no doubt about its ability to start again. Therefore, I am anxious to stress the importance of the resolution that is being debated this evening. I welcome the work of our coordinator, Mr Arif, and of all of the negotiators from the Committee on International Trade, who have ensured that the signal that the European Parliament will give tomorrow will be extremely symbolic because it is unanimous. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).

Presidents, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, may I thank all the rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and for the huge task accomplished in spite of what were at times conflicting interests. The first result of our efforts is that Parliament can now state the direction in which it intends to steer the future common fisheries policy. The second result is that, during the negotiations, our priority was to ensure that this text responds to the concerns expressed by fishermen. We have succeeded in this: the provisions relating to transferable individual quotas have been withdrawn, and support for small-scale and coastal fishing has been maintained. The third anticipated result is that the forthcoming document must result in a participative and bottom-up approach, that is to say, in consultation with all those involved in the sector. It must also incorporate those elements that are essential to the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, notably, the human and social dimension of the entire sector, which must be combined effectively with the promotion of sustainable fishing practices and with the conservation of the fish stock as part of an ecosystemic approach. I would like to add that, if we want to succeed in an ambitious reform of the common fisheries policy, then we must devote a budget to it that matches our stated ambitions. Our political commitment will be judged according to the resources that we grant it. We expect the Commission … (The President cut off the speaker) Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Zapatero, thank you first of all, Mr Zapatero, for reintroducing ambition, political perspective and also energy, at a time when the European Union has to bounce back from the crisis and in the wake of the failure in Copenhagen. I expect the Commission and the Presidency to enable us to put the creation of more and higher quality jobs, the fight against social exclusion, and sustainable development at the heart of the 2020 strategy. This is true in particular for the agriculture budget, and also for the fisheries budget. You have committed yourself to this. Mr Zapatero, we are counting on you to provide the resources for this policy, to associate the decontamination of soil with food security, to create the conditions for green jobs and for the preservation of fisheries resources, to ensure food security and to create fairer trading conditions for the countries of the South. We need an ambitious agriculture budget, and I would also ask you to link the fisheries budget with this budget. On these points, our jobs, but also our policy, will be judged on the basis of the results achieved. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Presidents, Minister, the Swedish Presidency has had what may be described as some historic moments: the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the appointments of the first President of the European Council and of the High Representative, but also the climate change conference and the appointment of a new Commission, as well as – please allow me this brief reference – the telecoms package. These events have created hope. All things considered, however, there remain one or two mixed results. Firstly, our Parliament, being committed to the introduction of European supervision of the financial markets, welcomed the proposals made by Mr de Larosière’s group of wise men as a crucial step. However, the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council of 2 December are well below this realistic level of ambition. I wish to mention at this point that Parliament will be sure to restore some balance to the proposals that have been referred to it, in order to make the financial markets more robust. The same applies to the financial commitments pledged to the countries of the South to help them combat climate change. Even though, in Copenhagen, poor countries require real commitments concerning long-term financing, the Council has only managed to pledge EUR 7.2 billion over three years. This is a first step, true, but it falls far short of the requirements, all the more so since part of it comes from a restructuring exercise. Lastly, in the financial field, we welcome the will to impose rules and to act forcefully with regard to both supervision and taxation. I note in particular, in the Council conclusions, the reference to a global financial transaction levy. This is something for which we socialists have been hoping and praying for more than 10 years. There is still work to be done. Seeking out new financial resources to promote employment, solidarity within and outside Europe, and the financing of the fight against climate change, is a major challenge. As it will soon be Christmas, I invite the Council to give us a decision on own resources in the years to come. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, on Thursday the European Union appointed Mr Van Rompuy as its first permanent President of the Council and Mrs Ashton to be in charge of European diplomacy. Ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to return to the debate that has been taking place in our institutions since these appointments were announced. Indeed, in my opinion, beyond the issue of names and functions, there is the central issue of the States. Let me explain what I mean. We are witnessing what could be the worst nightmare of those who conveyed the ideal of the European Community and their desire for union. At that time, it was believed that the roots of the Union were to be found in state legitimacy and that its future lay in transcending national selfishness. Tension between two contradictory mediums, which is sometimes painful, often produces original mechanisms, but, above all, serves a political approach that is unique in the world. This nightmare, ladies and gentlemen, is that of a Europe that would be limited to a community of intergovernmental acquisitions. The result, as we can see today, would be suspicion of incompetence, presumption of illegitimacy and tension between political families. In making this speech, I do not intend, as you will have gathered, to return to making judgments on mere intent. I prefer to recall with you the rights and duties of we MEPs. Our duty is to question the impenetrable haggling that surrounds appointments to the posts that resulted from the Treaty of Lisbon. Our duty, in future, is to force the Council to put an end to this undemocratic, archaic method of appointment that fosters the idea that Europe, in building itself, is sheltered from the peoples. Our duty is to use all our new parliamentary prerogatives to influence the policies that will result from the new powers guaranteed to us under the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament, between a weakened Commission and a strengthened intergovernmental centre, needs to become the institutional point of equilibrium. On this matter, I hope that the Vice-President of the Commission will be subject to the same hearing process by the European Parliament as the other commissioners. Indeed, we have a right to carry out this process; it is conferred by the treaties. I also support the proposal of Mrs Harms, who has suggested a meeting between the new President and the groups as a whole. Our duty is to kick-start European integration, which is in a seriously bad way. No one can reasonably want the mandates entrusted to Mr Van Rompuy or Mrs Ashton to fail and, more especially, I wish Mrs Ashton every success because I am proud that a woman has been appointed to this post of High Representative. Catherine Trautmann,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we are once again – this time for the last time – to discuss the telecom package and, more specifically, my report on the ‘framework’, ‘access’ and ‘authorisation’ directives, which represents the final cornerstone. This is an opportunity for me to thank my colleagues, particularly my co-rapporteurs Pilar del Castillo and Malcolm Harbour; the chair of the Conciliation Committee, Mr Vidal-Quadras; the chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Herbert Reul, and all the services of the European Parliament that were involved. I also wish to thank the Commissioner for her involvement and support throughout this period, and I thank her services as well. Finally, I also welcome the efforts of the Swedish Presidency to reach a satisfying conclusion. Let us take a moment to remember Ulrika Barklund Larsson. Tomorrow’s vote will give a very positive signal to those expecting a more dynamic European industrial policy. As the second reading agreement on 99% of the text has been maintained, I shall just summarise the aspects that we made our priority. In particular, we wanted to maintain effective, lasting competition, but also to make that competition useful to economic and social development through complete coverage of European territory in terms of access, high speed internet for all and for all regions – including better management of radio spectrum – and full rights for consumers. This will involve establishing a consistent, operational framework for those who will be using these directives, that is, regulators, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications and the Commission; guaranteeing legal certainty; encouraging the investment needed to relaunch our economy and make the market dynamic for operators, their consumers and employees; and, finally, developing plenty of high-quality services that are accessible to the majority and fairly priced. It is important that we remain within the terms of the agreement and, unfortunately, recent statements made by certain Member States raise some doubt over their commitment on this matter. I shall support the Commission’s interpretation of the result of our negotiations over Article 19. As a matter of interest, the wording chosen for this article is closely linked to the debate on the mechanisms of Articles 7 and 7a. It would be disappointing if the Council, through non-binding declarations, put across the message that it somehow wanted to have its cake and eat it by denying a fair balance of powers between Member States, BEREC and the Commission, as emerged in the final compromise. Finally, of course, the salient point that led us to conciliation: Amendment 138. I would just like to say that the result obtained was the maximum that Parliament could obtain with the legal basis we had: harmonisation of the internal market. So this result must not be taken lightly, since it offers all users of electronic connections solid protection of their right to privacy, to presumption of innocence and to contradictory procedure, no matter what course of action they face and before any sanctions are adopted. I am also delighted by the Commission’s willingness to assess the situation of net neutrality in Europe and to make the appropriate instruments available to Parliament and the Council by the end of the year, based on the result of these observations. To conclude, I therefore ask everyone to think about the transposition of the package. I am already aware that Parliament, to which this package means a great deal, will make sure that the transposition is undertaken with respect for past agreements. Mr President, I will now listen carefully to my colleagues’ speeches before taking the floor again at the end of the debate. Catherine Trautmann,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR)
 Mr President, may I express my warmest thanks to my colleagues who have taken part in this debate and say that they have certainly made clear what a perilous and difficult job we have had to complete this telecom package. Ultimately, it was held up by an amendment on which we have resoundingly voted several times in this Parliament, but which was not accepted by the Council. Like others, I believe this to be a basis and not an end. We have not succeeded on this point as we have on others. In the Commissioner’s response, she also stressed the same thing about Article 19. I had hoped we would go much further in implementing a procedure of economic arbitration with regard to European regulators, but of course, we could not achieve everything at once. We tried to be efficient, fair and balanced; we wanted to show that, while the internet and digital society are driven by use and mobility, citizens’ rights should never be ridiculed, scorned or ignored. This is the first time that a text of this kind includes such a reference in its first article, making it a basic principle and linking the internet with the exercise of rights and fundamental freedoms; we believe this makes what we are doing quite distinctive when we legislate with the Council and draft texts with the Commission. Indeed, we think that the information society should be both respectful of citizens’ rights and positive from an economic and social point of view, opening up a new cultural sphere. That is why we anticipate that the market will enable this to happen, that users’ rights will be stated and guaranteed, but that we can also have this extended access and connectivity for all. However, this is also why we now have a considerable job to do in the areas of copyright, net neutrality and radio spectrum. The European Parliament will lend its support. I would like to say what a pleasure it has been to work with my colleagues and how delighted I am that this compromise respects the vote that we so strongly expressed together. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Mr Barroso, I might as well say it straight away: you did not convince the French socialists for five years, and you are not succeeding in convincing us now with a project in which you are as generous in word as you are general in purpose. How can you say to us ‘vote for me if you want a Europe that is united in its diversity’, when it is precisely because we want this Europe that we are recommending waiting for the Irish vote so as to vote on your candidacy? Armed with the support of the Member States, you preferred to secure your appointment ahead of time and with fewer risks as regards the number of votes required. You thought that the passage before Parliament would be a mere formality: it is not so, and this is just the beginning, for your response does not meet the expectations of the citizens, who are suffering in the crisis and who have demonstrated their anger towards our institutions through their low turnout. You say that the crisis has changed you and you pose as the great navigator of a united Europe, but you have not been able to guide the Member States towards a truly European recovery plan, and we are still awaiting the concrete and binding measures needed for financial regulation. You claim to have given us guarantees regarding the social agenda, but all you are advocating is a new regulation, not a review of the Posting of Workers Directive. Moreover, you have not made a firm, and above all clear, commitment on a directive protecting public services. You show contempt for the MEPs’ memory of events. We have not forgotten that, over the last five years, social issues have never been at the heart of the proposed solutions, and it is only now that you are agreeing to a social impact study for each piece of European legislation. In a period of unprecedented crisis, which is destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs, everything must be done to ensure that the number of European unemployed workers or working poor does not reach 25 million by 2010. For this we need an industrial policy to be adopted. The citizens need to be set an example of solidarity in order to combat the crisis. Neither in your words nor in your declared ambition for Europe will they find this impetus today. To carry on as before is disastrous, said the philosopher, Walter Benjamin. You still have a very long way to go to win over the socialists and the social democrats. For the sake of political consistency and out of respect for our electorate, we shall not vote for you. Eric Andrieu  (S&amp;D

 We Socialists have always denounced the lack of transparency in the negotiations on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and our fight to refuse this agreement has steadily been gaining ground in Parliament, where five parliamentary committees have rejected it. There was therefore only one responsible answer that we could give to citizens regarding the ACTA: for Parliament to reject it in plenary. Despite the numerous delaying tactics by the right, and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in particular, that is exactly what we have done here today and I am delighted. Parliament therefore remains at the forefront of protecting the most stringent European standards on fundamental rights. I wish, in this respect, to acknowledge the work of my predecessor, Kader Arif. The ACTA was the worst possible response to what is a real problem: an agreement that has no effect in beating the scourge of counterfeiting, but, what is more, a potentially dangerous agreement for the fundamental freedoms of European citizens with its massive legal uncertainties. In addition, many other concerns were raised about neutrality, about open access to the Internet, about access to generic drugs or about the protection of geographical indications. Clearly, it did not come up to scratch. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

I voted against the Passenger Name Record (PNR) Agreement between the United States and the EU on the use and transfer of the name records of European passengers. I opposed this agreement as the negotiations in Parliament did not enable a compromise to be found on the necessary guarantees to protect the data of European passengers. Indeed, no provisions have been made to specify the purpose to which the data is put, which has been left too vague, to reduce the retention period of 15 years without, however, making provision for them to be deleted at a later date, and guarantees that the Member States concerned have given their consent if their nationals’ data are transferred to third countries`	.  The list of data to be transferred is also disproportionate leaving a great number of issues open, and does not make any provision for confidential treatment of sensitive data. Finally, it is a very rigid agreement, as judicial redress for Europeans in US courts is very limited, and no provision is made for the presence of the European Parliament and Member States in the review procedures for this agreement. I am not questioning the need to achieve transatlantic cooperation against terrorism, but rather the means chosen to achieve this, which run counter to the high data protection standards supported by the French Socialists.

 I voted for the report of the European Parliament on the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base. On the one hand, this report provides for harmonising the corporate tax base for companies at European level, that is taxable profits, and on the other hand, companies and groups of companies operating within the internal market will be able to add together the profits and losses of their own subsidiaries located in different Member States. The net profit will then be apportioned between these different states on the basis of a mathematical formula and pre-defined factors. The European Parliament spoke with a single voice, thanks to this text, in favour of the progressively obligatory nature of this Common Consolidated Tax Base, a major step forward in terms of adopting a political stance against fiscal dumping and relocations within Europe. An essential element in tackling this phenomenon is still lacking, however, insofar as no agreement has been reached, and that was not the aim of this directive, on the tax rates imposed by each Member State, which remain diverse. It is therefore progress in terms of politics, but is unlikely to be taken up by the Council. It is merely the first brick in the wall of a long struggle to regulate the European market.

 The European Parliament has been consulted on the reform of the system of taxation of energy products and electricity. While I voted in favour of Ms Lulling’s report, I believe that if it is to be understood and accepted by citizens, this change should take place gradually, bearing in mind the current socio-economic situation. Today, the cost of fuel is already a major expense for family incomes, and some families have consequently started to change their consumer habits. That is why I am opposed to the ‘proportionality’ principle between the different threshold levels applicable to each type of energy, which is likely to cause a very great increase in the cost of diesel, a widely-used fuel in France. Europe’s ecological objectives must not be achieved at the expense of the objectives of employment, competitiveness, and protection of consumers’ purchasing power, but must go hand in hand with these. Let us hope that the Council, the sole decision maker in fiscal matters, will listen to this message from the MEPs. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 At the end of 2011, the procedure for drawing up the 2012 budget was marked by deep rifts between Parliament and the Council concerning the financing of ITER, the thermonuclear fusion research project based at Cadarache in the Bouches-du-Rhône. EUR 750 million of cost overruns compared with the initial estimates had to be found for 2012 and only EUR 100 million had been agreed by the end of 2011. A compromise therefore had to be found for the remaining EUR 650 million. After long negotiations with the Council, Parliament succeeded in getting this money released by increasing the financial ceiling of the budget heading concerned, while the Council initially envisaged financing solely through the redeployment of funds from the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development. The additional financing needed for the ITER project in 2012 will therefore be available without the other research programmes being compromised. Along with all the Members of the European Parliament, I will nonetheless remain vigilant as to the sources of financing that will be mobilised in 2013 to cover the overrun that has already been announced. It is our duty to ensure that the ITER project will not be financed to the detriment of other priority policies of the EU 2020 strategy. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 While the debates on the future of the post-2014 cohesion policy have just begun in the European Parliament, which has been granted power of codecision on this matter under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament wanted to point out the specific nature of the outermost regions (ORs) – including the French overseas departments and territories – and the need to grant them adequate resources for their economic and social development. On account of their remoteness, their insularity and their extreme climatic conditions, these territories do actually need differential treatment, both for the viability of local agricultural and industrial production and for the successful implementation of the various EU programmes and remits. As such, the Commission’s proposal to halve the budget allocated to offset the additional costs on these territories is highly regrettable. What is more, I had proposed amendments on this subject in the opinion that the Committee on Budgets issued on the Teixeira report, and I had pointed out the need to include the accession of Mayotte to OR status in the 2014-2020 financial forecasts for these regions. In 2014, Mayotte will actually become the fifth outermost French territory recognised by the European Union. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 After 18 long months of negotiations with the Council, Parliament has finally been able to agree to the new regulation on over-the-counter derivatives. Traders are now required to clear these contracts through central counterparties and to report all derivatives, even those not negotiated over the counter. Moreover, the powers of intervention of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) have been increased in terms of settling disputes between national regulators. These decisions were considered essential in order to improve the transparency of the financial markets, given that derivatives had a large part to play in aggravating the volatility of the markets during the 2008 crisis. However, this is only a first step in regulating the financial sector: others, which Parliament could not support because of the Council’s opposition, will have to be examined in the future, in particular, enhancing the role of ESMA.

 While the debates on the general budget for the European Union for 2013 are already showing signs of becoming strained between Parliament and the Council, we, the MEPs, are in the process of drawing up the next operational budget for our institution. Aware of certain budgetary constraints, we have evaluated the change in our funding requirements at + 1.9% in comparison with 2012, an increase below the level of inflation. Some budget lines will be subject to freezing in order to achieve this target, such as Members’ allowances, transport costs, etc. Other areas will also need to be studied closely in order to avoid any overspending: this is the case for costs relating to building maintenance or the establishment of the House of European History. Over the course of the year, we will also need to be more vigilant about some additional necessary loans, such as those relating to the accession of Croatia, which have still not been included in the budget’s provisions. Parliament must be exemplary in establishing its budget to ensure that it has the means to fully guarantee its democratically received powers while controlling its spending within reasonable limits.

 Every year, the European Commission publishes a report on the state of gender equality in Europe. Unfortunately, the same findings recur every year: gender stereotyping, ancestral taboos and an outdated view of the division of roles between women and men persist, preventing any improvement in the circumstances of women in the European Union. In 2011, the crisis helped make the situation worse, since, in affecting women more severely than men, it undermined their economic independence. Employment, access to positions of political and economic responsibility, freedom and sexual health: all issues that still require a continuous struggle in order to achieve genuine gender equality. This also has to be a daily struggle, in everyday life as well as in the European Parliament, where, at every opportunity, almost one third of Members regrettably call into question the issue of access to contraception and abortion.

 By defining the general guidelines for the preparation of the 2013 budget, Parliament wanted to focus mainly on support for jobs (especially for young people) and SMEs. These priorities bear a strange resemblance to the priorities Parliament defined for the 2012 budget. Now, the difficulties of the latest budget negotiations are already putting in doubt the result of the discussions that are soon to take place on the drafting of the 2013 budget. Are the budget guidelines merely Parliament’s pious hopes? I fear so, as the negotiations have followed the same tragic route for two years: the draft budget from the Commission, supported by Parliament, undergoes cuts by the Council, which is more interested in reducing its contribution to the EU budget than in the budget’s added-value. This fool’s game has been played since Parliament failed to use its new powers of budgetary codecision to oppose the Council’s sterile wishes in 2010. 2012 will also be the year when the 2014-2020 financial framework is drafted. It will be difficult to prevent the Council’s short-term ‘in times of crisis’ vision from being applied to the definition of the ‘post-crisis’ financial perspectives. We must, however, support an ambitious position, for a Europe in line with the expectations of Europeans. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Mr President, we should, of course, be glad that the Member States have finally reached an agreement to ensure the immediate future of the European food aid programme for the most deprived citizens. This agreement was vital for millions of Europeans who have already been given a rough ride because of the crisis but it is far, far from enough. In fact, it is conditional upon the withdrawal of the Food Aid Programme in 2014, and on the will of the German Chancellor, a will that unfortunately is not upset, that Europe is no longer funding any social policy of this type beyond that date. We are Europe. We have core values and shared ideals that we support: peace, prosperity, of course, but also solidarity and the right to dignity, given that dignity is the opposite of humiliation … (The President asked the speaker to slow down) Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

The decision taken under the French Presidency to do away with quotas risked leaving milk producers without any safeguards in the case of market disturbances. We therefore welcome the ‘milk package’ proposal as a first step in the right direction. It was necessary to strengthen producers’ negotiating power in relation to the private processing industry by encouraging them to group together and promoting the use of contracts, which are only used for half of all production. My Socialist colleagues, especially Stéphane Le Foll, helped to improve the proposal by ensuring the future of milk production in vulnerable regions where cheeses with protected designations are made. There is still a great deal to do, however. In particular, it will be essential to shift the balance back towards livestock farming and provide other market tools in order to prevent any further crises in the milk sector. We must take the opportunity presented by the CAP reform to supplement this mechanism so as to guarantee farmers’ income and once again put them back where they belong at the heart of the food supply chain and food safety in Europe.

 Mr Fisas Ayxela’s report gave Parliament the opportunity to support the European Commission’s communication of 18 January 2011 on developing the European dimension in sport, this being the Commission’s first policy document on this subject since it became a Community responsibility. While I welcome the report’s commitment to reminding us of the key values that playing sport can convey and suggesting the type of actions that should reflect the Community added value in this field, I wonder about the EU’s current ability to effectively assume this responsibility. With only EUR 4 million specifically dedicated to sport each year (in the form of a ‘preparatory action’, in other words, a temporary action), the Union does not have the resources to effectively combat doping, to support sport for people with disabilities, to promote the development of a ‘European identity’ through sport, etc., an issue that must be addressed in the months ahead, when Member States are being asked to establish the EU budgetary framework for 2014-2020.

 Could Mr Gauzès specify the nature of the commitments made by Renault to Mr Bertrand, the relevant minister, which appear to him to be serious? Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 – (FR)
 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, led by my conscience and my sense of responsibility, I will vote against the French Government’s application for aid on behalf of Renault, and I will do so as an individual. Because, unlike other groups, Renault refused to take account of the situation of former, older, workers laid off in 2009 and soon left with nothing following the entry into force of the reform of the pension system. Because, with profits of more than EUR 3 billion in 2010, the Renault Group exploits the full potentialities of globalisation. Because I think that, at a time when everyone is being urged to tighten their belts, signing a blank cheque for EUR 24.5 million with no quid pro quo
 is outrageous. Because, finally, Commissioner, the training and support measures presented by the applicants as active back-to-work measures, the only ones eligible for funding under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) are, in fact, disconnected from any resumption-of-activity logic. This is not about salving our consciences by creating the illusion that we are supporting European industry. In the end, what counts is that we support the interests of the workers in the industry and the associated jobs. This is a case in which the EGF is being derailed, and we must draw the necessary conclusions in order to adapt it. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, we wish to table an oral amendment. After contact was made on numerous occasions, the management of Renault and the French Government have so far refused to take into account the situation of company workers who, in 2009, agreed to leave the company and are affected by the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) application and who, since then, have seen their rights eroded and their income reduced through the application of the reform of the French pension system. The amendment is as follows: Paragraph 2a: calls on Renault and the French Government to commit themselves formally to take the necessary legal and financial measures to restore all rights and pension benefits, while granting work exemption under equivalent conditions to workers whose pension benefits were affected by reforms having entered into force since their dismissal.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome the strengthening of the mandate for the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) as proposed in this report, and I would like to support this great need to deepen integration of maritime safety by giving the example of transnational cooperation in the English Channel, which is in decline. After 10 years of Franco-British cofinancing of an emergency tow vessel, the UK Government has now decided to stop funding the vessel as part of its cutbacks, thereby reducing the safety of that sea crossing, one of the busiest in the world, which is being hit hard by the impact of privatising these services and the lack of a shared vision. It is therefore vital that the national authorities responsible for transposing this legislation – primarily the national coastguard services – act in unison in order to guarantee the efficiency and durability of transnational actions. I therefore believe it is of utmost importance for EMSA to show concern for safety in the English Channel and coordinate the action taken by Member States in that area. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this report because the European Union must increase aid for its regions, particularly rural ones, in order to encourage economic recovery. We must therefore support the Commission’s proposal to temporarily increase the Union’s maximum cofinancing rate for EAFRD (European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development) programmes in struggling States that receive support from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (euro area) or the balance of payments facility for non-euro area Member States. The Commission’s proposal is nonetheless paradoxical since, at the same time, it claims to be in favour of the Franco-German proposal to suspend the payment of regional funds to struggling States in order to force them to put their public accounts in order. Penalising those States by suspending cohesion policy funds, while offering increased support for EAFRD programmes, amounts to arbitrary discrimination against non-agricultural areas. If it is to recover from the economic crisis, the European Union must lend its support to all of those regions that are struggling. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find it hard to celebrate the fact that we have reached an agreement with the Council on financing the extra cost of ITER. The point of these discussions (which muddied the negotiations on the budget) was not simply to find a solution for ITER. The main issue was, in fact, to deal with the underfunding of the European Union budget, which has become a structural problem to the extent that we are now in a position of questioning whether or not the EU has the capacity to honour its international commitments. The ITER project is yet another illustration of the fact that the EU budget is not adequate to meet either the EU’s ambitions or our strategies. The reason that ITER has become, and will continue to be, one of the greatest sources of ongoing tension between Parliament and the Council is that Member States are demanding ever more from the European Union on the project, but are not willing to bear the financial consequences. By tinkering around the edges, and proposing short term solutions for funding these increasingly costly major projects, Member States are jeopardising the Union’s capacity, from 2013 onwards, to afford the tasks for which it is responsible. For the period 2014 to 2020, by deciding to remove the ITER and GMES projects from the next financial framework, even though they were both established as research and development projects by a majority vote, the Commission is admitting that it is actually unable to guarantee that the financial resources will be there to meet our responsibilities. This is a serious admission of failure and incapacity. The Union does not have the wherewithal to abide by its international commitments, and yet research, innovation and energy are among the major aims of the 2020 strategy, along with employment, sustainable development and growth. Pitting these different priorities against each other is not the way to … (The President cut off the speaker) Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, this 2012 budget is the Council budget, to which the European Parliament has added a little spiritual something by ensuring the inclusion of a few priorities, but priorities in the form of commitment appropriations, which, Commissioner, will exacerbate the problem of amounts outstanding. The countercyclical development and growth targets have again been severely obstructed in the EU budget for 2012. Firstly, because competition between programmes, which is the consequence of cutting costs willy-nilly, has been given priority at the expense of structuring measures that would allow us to take an active role in overcoming the crisis. Secondly, because Member States are refusing to honour payments in a timely manner – despite being legally required to do so – and are therefore deterring project leaders from developing structural initiatives. Lastly, because the Council has refused to increase, among other things, the funding for financial supervisory authorities and to further the creation of a proper fund to manage farming crises, thereby turning a blind eye to the context in which this budget will have to be implemented. The Member States are therefore imposing austerity measures on the European Union, just as they have done for their own citizens. The current negotiations on this budget are merely the precursor to the impending negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework. It will be hard to resolve the apparent lack of confidence between the institutions, resulting, in particular, from the Council’s decision to question the figures provided by the Commission, which I am sure you appreciated, Commissioner, and the failure to comply with decisions that apply to both branches of the budgetary authority. Yet there are instruments in place for that purpose – I am referring to new own resources, which could put an end to the inevitable deadlock created by the antagonism between net contributors and net beneficiaries. There is now no time to waste. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 I voted for Ms Berès’s resolution as it is vitally important for the emergence of European economic governance to go hand in hand with greater democratic scrutiny. In order to deal with the major changes that will have to take place if it is to emerge from the crisis, the EU must ensure the strong democratic legitimacy of its decisions. This legitimacy can only be guaranteed with the European Parliament’s support and involvement in the annual drafting of the EU’s main economic policy guidelines. In particular, it is essential for Parliament to participate in the European Semester procedure, during which each of the 27 draft national budgets is assessed by the European Commission. Following this procedure, Parliament should have the chance to amend the macro-economic policy guidelines proposed to Member States. This democratic development also requires enhanced dialogue with the national parliaments and the social partners in order to support European economic policy coherence and guarantee that the EU 2020 objectives are taken into account. Finally, it is vital that the Treaties be revised only with the agreement and, where necessary, the involvement, of Parliament. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 The maritime area is changing. There are numerous challenges in this area, starting with the need for shared use. In particular, this means developing fishery-related jobs, which must be an objective of the common fisheries policy; strengthening maritime freight; harnessing the extraordinary industrial potential of offshore wind parks; and developing tourism activities. There can be no policy without a budget; we therefore need to ensure that the integrated maritime policy has its place in the future multiannual financial framework. However, I would say that, if this policy is to be a success, it is vital to get the Member States well and truly on board. This policy requires cross-sectoral but also transnational cooperation. However, in the Channel, transnational cooperation is waning. After 10 years of cofinancing an emergency tow vessel with France, the UK Government has now decided, as part of its cutbacks, to privatise its coastguard service, thereby reducing the safety of that sea crossing, one of the busiest in the world, which is being hit hard by the lack of a shared vision. An integrated maritime policy at European level must therefore be based on a synergy between national maritime policies, a synergy enhanced by a European ambition, which is itself equipped with adequate financial resources.

 I voted in favour of the report on illegal fishing at the global level, because its aim is beyond dispute. Illegal fishing unfairly competes with legal fishing and also often goes hand in hand with serious social conditions. There is no international framework today in which to share common standards. It is therefore vital for the European Union to become a proactive force in the bodies to which it belongs. During the forthcoming debates on the common fisheries policy, I will, however, be keeping a close eye on the issue of sanctions, which is raised in this report. Indeed, the resolution recommends withdrawing European subsidies for those who breach the rules. This proposal will need to be discussed with local players before it is taken any further. The entry into force of the point-based licence is also welcomed; I am unable to support this given the state of the current implementing arrangements. Furthermore, and in view of the UK Government’s recent decision to stop subsidising safety in the Channel, I made sure that it was spelt out in the report that the Union needs to improve its own operations, in particular, by creating a European coastguard, so as to ensure that our actions are more coordinated and effective.

 The report on the European platform against poverty and social exclusion, submitted by Frédéric Daerden, highlights a depressing paradox: whilst 116 million Europeans are threatened with poverty and 42 million of them are experiencing extreme material deprivation, the EU 2020 strategy only sets a target of 20 million in terms of reducing the number of people threatened by poverty. Is this an acknowledgement of weakness or an admission of the abandonment of the principle of solidarity, one of the Union’s founding values? Unfortunately, it can be seen in this way, given the ‘solution’ for the Food Distribution Programme for the Most Deprived Persons of the Community: it will be safeguarded for 2012 and 2013, but with unacceptable conditions, namely, the definitive scrapping of this programme and the abandonment of any EU-level social policy from 2014. This proposal is a provocation at a time when citizens are sorely affected by the crisis and austerity plans. It threatens to reinforce the impression of economic, social and moral regression. This is why, out of respect for the idea of a progressive, supportive Europe, we must continue to rally round this programme: for my part, I shall be paying particular attention during the negotiations on the financial perspectives after 2013.

 Mr President, for the second year running we are in a no-win situation, as the Commission – correct me if I am wrong, Commissioner – has produced a budget proposal that will barely be enough to implement the programmes we have undertaken, and will certainly not develop them or take on board the powers of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Council is clinging to its austerity dogma, and arbitrarily deciding on cuts to programmes that are extremely important in the light of the economic and social climate. Our proposal seeks to mobilise the EU budget to work towards the Europe 2020 strategy goals, and places the emphasis on programmes for research, employment, competitiveness, cohesion and public investment. It is a cohesive position, and one which we owe to the strong commitment of our rapporteur, Ms Balzani. We owe her our thanks for this. The EU budget is underfunded, due to the squeeze by Member States whose only goals are austerity, reducing public expenditure, punishing the regions – I am referring to macroeconomic conditionality – and punishing citizens, starting with the most deprived among them. I am referring to the deplorably sad fate that the Council intends to mete out to the European food aid scheme for the most deprived. If we take an honest look at the situation, at present we have no own resources, no Eurobonds, a predominantly intergovernmental method, a budget that is derisory, as this discussion also seems to be, considering the stakes at play in the European Summit and the billions that Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy are waving about to reassure the financial markets.

 I abstained on this resolution because, as the Commission has confirmed to us, referral to the Court of Justice of the European Union would block the parliamentary consent procedure, when the period of validity of the Protocol to the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco is due to expire at the end of February. In order to prevent Parliament, which unfortunately has been consulted far too late, from having its decision-making powers blocked, I chose to abstain by taking the view that the debate should focus not on this resolution but on the Protocol. Furthermore, since the fishermen are already fishing off the Moroccan coast, Parliament’s vote will only have a retroactive effect. If we want to obtain proper guarantees from the Commission and the Moroccan Government regarding the benefits of these activities for all the populations concerned and regarding the economic importance that they represent for the EU, then it is on the future agreement, which will replace the previous agreement from February onwards, that we will have to focus all our efforts. I am confident that the Commission will be able to negotiate a new agreement that lives up to expectations and that it will involve Parliament, so that it is not in danger of having its powers blocked again.

 Along with the majority of members in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I voted against four of the six reports from the economic governance package. I voted in favour of the report on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances and abstained on the report on the enforcement measures to correct macroeconomic imbalances. Most of the new measures, which follow multiple negotiations conducted in Brussels, merely impose austerity on citizens without taking account of the economic recovery that we need if we are to get back on the path to growth and employment. The Ferreira report was alone in offering persuasive solutions in this area. Indeed, this report provides for the guaranteed protection of social rights and the introduction of a very wide range of economic indicators which allow the situation in each country to be properly taken into account. It also advocates a symmetrical approach, pointing the finger at those Member States with huge trade surpluses as being responsible for developing macroeconomic imbalances.

 Mr President, the European Council of Ministers for Agriculture failed to oppose a reduction of 75% in food aid to the most deprived. Seventy-five per cent! What we see on the ground is that the blocking of this programme by a minority of Member States arouses outrage, incomprehension and exasperation among members of the public, charities and their volunteers and, of course, beneficiaries. This situation undermines the credibility and image of the Union. Our citizens are aware that Europe is devoting a great deal of energy and resources to reassuring the markets, as demonstrated in the speech given by Mr Barroso this morning, and that it is mobilising less and less to come to the aid of the populations hardest hit by the crisis. That gives rise to a feeling of injustice and mistrust of the European institutions, which is potentially explosive, socially and democratically. Commissioner, as you said, Parliament has taken its responsibilities seriously, as has the Commission. It is now up to the Member States, including France, whose leaders are shedding crocodile tears over this programme, to reach agreement. If they so wish – as you said, Commissioner, it is matter of political will – on Monday this matter will be closed in the Council of Ministers for Employment and Social Affairs. It should never have been opened out of solidarity and respect for the beneficiaries. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy market integrity and transparency. The regulation lays down new rules that are designed to stop abusive practices in the wholesale energy markets, among other means by giving more powers to monitor and impose penalties to the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), which was set up in 2009. Considering that at present one of the main objectives of EU energy policy is to complete the establishment of the internal gas and electricity market, and that research and investment are concentrating on developing trans-European energy networks, it is extremely important for this new market to be governed by rules that will protect consumers. We can also expect energy trading between Member States to increase over the next few years. The research currently being done in the North Sea on creating a network capable of transporting offshore wind energy is just one example of what is needed for the future. It will therefore be beneficial to provide an appropriate legislative framework for this new market, so that it can develop properly and expand within a clearly defined legal framework.

 I voted in favour of the review of the Regulation on the Frontex Agency because it was vital to clarify its role and responsibilities while ensuring that it respects migrants’ fundamental rights when carrying out its operations. The need for this review has become even more obvious in the light of the Arab revolutions and the migratory movements that have followed. I therefore welcome several of the proposed amendments, such as the establishment of a consultative forum, which will exercise greater control over Frontex’s activities, and the requirement for the agency to undertake rescue at sea during humanitarian emergencies, or face the suspension of its operations. The possibility that the agency will not have to depend any more on the Member States, by acquiring its equipment itself, together with the increased information given to Parliament, are amendments that will help to clarify the link between Frontex and political decisions. One aspect that has particularly caught my attention is the creation, thanks to this regulation, of the status of European border guards. This development, which is only terminological at present, is an innovation that may, we hope, have a bearing on other groups of professionals requiring the same coordination, such as the coastguards of the various Member States, for example.

It is only by implementing Europe-wide solutions, such as issuing Eurobonds, which will enable more effective management of sovereign debt, greater investment in education, research and vocational education and the establishment of sound, effective economic governance, that Europe will be able to come out of this crisis for good. In its report by the Special Committee on Policy Challenges of 8 June 2011, Parliament called for EU budget resources to match the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. However, this message was regrettably not repeated in the final version of the Crisis Committee’s report. If we are to implement the Europe 2020 strategy, boost Europe’s economy and promote employment, we will certainly need a substantial increase in the EU budget over the next few years.

 Mr President, I should like to thank our rapporteur and praise the quality of the draft text of this mandate for the trialogue, which stresses the urgency of finally mobilising the annual budgets for the benefit of the Europe 2020 strategy and in a way that is consistent with the European semester approach. Nevertheless, the negotiations promise to be difficult, since the Commission’s guiding principle is to satisfy, by presenting a squeezed budget, the austerity requirements imposed by the Member States, while ignoring citizens’ needs. In this respect, the fate awaiting the food aid programmes targeting the most impoverished populations is symptomatic. Like many of my fellow Members, Commissioner, I was informed by the press that the European Commission is planning to drastically cut funding for the Most Deprived Persons (MDP) programme. Thus, it would be divided by four, from 500 million this year to only 113 million next year. The Union currently spends EUR 1 per capita and per year to defend the fundamental principle of these citizens’ right to food, in a rationale of European solidarity. The scrapping of this symbolic euro on the altar of national self-interests and budgetary austerity illustrates Europe’s moral and political failure. It is often said that the level of development of a human society can be measured by how it cares for its most vulnerable and deprived members. To cite technical and legal difficulties as an excuse for dismantling this food aid programme is disastrous not only for the people concerned but also for Europe’s credibility and image. The Commission is making fools of MEPs and the citizens they represent by proposing amounts in April and then dividing them by four two months later. Commissioner, I hope that you will change your mind on this particular decision, and that you will not remain deaf to the political objectives and budgetary intentions thereof which are expressed in this mandate for the trialogue.

 I voted in favour of this report on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste to send a clear message to the Member States: polluters must be held responsible for their waste. Indeed, whether it is a question of waste resulting from activities relating to the production of electricity or activities in other areas such as medicine, research and industry, the export of radioactive waste to third countries is an irresponsible practice that has been condemned by Parliament in adopting this report. Despite the success of this vote, given the cross-border implications for the safety and health of European citizens, I regret the minor role that Parliament has been given in nuclear matters as it has only a consultative role in this matter. Thanks to an amendment brought by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, this report underlines the need to find a new legal basis for legislation in nuclear matters in order for the interests of European citizens to be better represented on issues that are of such direct concern to them.

 Mr President, the debate on the European Union’s financial perspective raises questions about the European project, its scope and its ambition. This report is laudable because it seeks to mobilise the Union’s budgetary resources in order to comply with the Europe 2020 strategy. This puts it at odds with the narrow vision of most Member States. Whereas Member States see Europe in terms of their financial contribution, which they want to see reduced, and the financial returns, which they want to see increased, this report argues in favour of strong and integrated Community policies, be they long-established policies or new competences under the Treaty of Lisbon. Consequently, this own-initiative report by Parliament should form the basis for future discussions, even if, in my view, it does err on the side of consensus and caution. It is true that a 5% increase in the European budget would be better than the Member States’ budgetary plans for 2012. However, the crux of the matter – and probably the stumbling block – will be agreeing a figure that tallies with the policies described in the report. We are aware of the downsides of austerity policies: how they affect employment and have left growing numbers of citizens despairing. We have a responsibility to finance countercyclical policies, not least through a strong cohesion policy, Mr Pieper, which promotes public investment and employment in all European regions. I would like to stress the importance of creating an intermediate regions category to ensure that the allocation of Structural Funds accurately reflects economic and social realities in the regions. Let me conclude by saying that we need to impose a tax on financial speculation, which would increase our citizens’ support for a well-financed Europe. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 With the adoption of the Garriga report on the political and budgetary challenges facing the European Union after 2013, Parliament is anticipating, much too timidly in my view, the debate to come on the future financial prospects of the Union. This report reiterates its opposition to pitting against each other the different policies that fall within EU competence and insists on the need to mobilise sufficient funds, consistent with the EU 2020 strategy. It sends a clear message to Member States: we intend to support strong integrated policies and to do this by increasing the budget by at least 5%. Furthermore, in a context where citizens are subjected to austerity, we must maintain a strong cohesion policy. That is what we propose in this report, with support for the plan to create an intermediate category of regions, which will enable a distribution of Structural Funds that is more in accordance with the real economic and social situations of our territories. Finally, the Union must grant itself financial resources that match its ambitions. We have therefore reiterated our desire to introduce a tax on financial transactions, a project which is widely supported by the public and which would encourage greater support on their part for the European project.

 This resolution was adopted following the proposal by the Commission aimed at opening the negotiations on renewing the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Mauritania. Voting in favour of a resolution is unfortunately the only thing Parliament can do to be heard in the negotiations of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA). At present, Parliament can only have its say once the negotiations have ended, which leaves it no other option than to either approve these agreements or reject their ratification, thus leaving it very little room for manoeuvre. Now, the Treaties stipulate that Parliament be ‘immediately and fully informed at all stages of the procedure’. Hence, it is essential and legitimate that we ask to be associated with the European Commission and Council during these negotiations. This issue is not new and raises regular questioning of the European Commission by the members of the Committee on Fisheries. It is regrettable that we are not able to make binding our opinion on our priorities relating to the provision of European funds to the countries concerned, in spite of the fact that Parliament has the power to exercise financial control.

The adoption of a Parliament resolution on the European fisheries sector crisis due to the rise in oil prices is an opportunity for me to remind you how urgent it is for us to come to the aid of fishermen. In a context where recruitment is becoming more and more difficult, and where the practices that fishermen must adopt continue to become ever more restrictive, the increase in fuel prices makes conditions even more difficult in this crisis-hit sector. The substantial increase in oil prices is having a strong impact on fishermen’s operational costs, and this caused their revenue to fall between 2008 and 2010. As the elected representative of a port town, it is all the more incumbent on me to call on the Commission to authorise an increase in the ceiling of the de minimis
 aid. This measure would relieve the pressure on fishermen, thereby enabling them to make a decent living from their work without hindering the replenishment of stocks. The upcoming reform of the common fisheries policy will have to gain the support of fishermen. To show them today that the European Union is alert to their needs would be a good start.

 Following recent events which have highlighted the potential abuses of lobbying, it has appeared all the more necessary to increase transparency regarding the work of interest groups at the European institutions. The merging of the lists of lobbyists registered at the Parliament and the Commission represents a first step towards compiling an exhaustive register of the lobbies active in Brussels and, subsequently, towards greater citizen access to democratic checks and balances in the decision-making process. I have, however, fought to prevent the offices representing local authorities at the European institutions from being affected by this measure. Indeed, I consider these structures to be the direct product of democratically-elected bodies (town, departmental, regional councils, etc.). They represent the general interest, and should therefore be distinguished from lobbyists who defend individual interests. Furthermore, I hope that this register will develop to become mandatory one day, and include all lobbyists who are active at the European institutions. The notion of transparency is crucial to European Union policy and it must be extended to cover all interest groups that participate in its operation. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, EU fishermen are, as we know, confronted with three major problems: firstly, the very complex, unpopular quota system has forced them to adopt very restrictive practices. Secondly, the lack of training opportunities and the profession’s perceived loss of prestige are causing significant recruitment problems. Thirdly, and this is the issue we are discussing today, the rise in oil prices is making operating conditions in this crisis-hit sector even more difficult. Between 2008 and 2010, French fishermen, for example, lost EUR 100-200 in income per week as a result of fluctuating oil prices, even though their turnover remained the same. As an elected representative from a port town, I strongly support my fellow Members in demanding that the Commission authorise an increase in the de minimis
 aid ceilings. This measure would relieve the pressure on fishermen, thereby enabling them to make a decent living from their work. However, contrary to what has also been said, it would not affect the replenishment of stocks. The future reform of the common fisheries policy will have to seek the support of fishermen. To show them today, on Europe Day in particular, that the European Union is alert to their needs would already be a good start, Commissioner. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European food aid programme for the most deprived persons in the EU was urgently introduced during the exceptionally cold winter of 1986, then enshrined the following year in the common agricultural policy. This programme has become vital for 13 million Europeans who have little job security. It eases the strain on their food budget through distributions by charities and social services, and adds up to a mere EUR 1 per European per year in aid. Together with the Federation of Food Banks, Secours populaire
, the Red Cross and Restos du Coeur
 in France, I am concerned about the future of this programme after the European Court of Justice called into question its funding within the framework of the CAP. Our Parliament has often emphasised the fundamental nature of the right to food. Our institutions made 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. To cite legal ambiguity as an excuse for dismantling, as some Member States are trying to do, a food aid programme that has proved its worth would be disastrous not only for the people concerned but also for Europe’s credibility and image. That is why I call on the Commission to take the political measures necessary to safeguard, preserve and strengthen that programme. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 The parliamentary resolution on the lessons to be drawn from the nuclear accident in Japan contained some very positive points with regard to the safety of power plants, recommending, for example, ‘stress tests’ carried out in a coordinated manner at EU level by independent bodies working in accordance with the most exacting standards and completely transparently. Furthermore, like everyone else in the French socialist delegation, I supported the amendments in favour of a carefully planned and prepared phasing-out of nuclear power, reflecting the fight against global warming. That phasing-out of nuclear power will have to go hand in hand with increased investment in research and innovation, in order to reduce our energy dependence and increase the number of renewable forms of energy in the energy mix of the EU Member States. I did, however, vote against the motion as a whole, because it was merely a juxtaposition of viewpoints forming an inconsistent motion. After such a disastrous event as Fukushima, the question of the future of a sector as sensitive as nuclear energy requires more than a hastily put together resolution. We will now have to take the time necessary to organise a genuinely constructive debate, addressing all of the associated issues while enabling everyone to voice his or her opinion.

 I voted in favour of this report on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in support of the food industry employees (UNILEVER) in the Czech Republic. I would stress, however, that there is an urgent need to review the regulation of that fund as soon as possible. To this end, during the vote I co-signed and secured the adoption of an amendment specifying that it is detrimental for the regulation not to require an investigation into the financial health, possible tax evasion or state aid situation of multinationals which benefit from the intervention of the EGF. At a time when the European Union is struggling to finance its objectives and is obliged to choose between policies of equally high priority, the Community budget cannot afford to fund the market entry and relocation strategies of large multinational companies whose sole intention is to increase their profits. This must be taken into account in the forthcoming regulation, without prejudicing redundant workers by compromising their access to the EGF. Estelle Grelier,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their committed and constructive participation in the work done by the Committee on Fisheries on this report on transitional technical measures. The report has aroused lively debate, given the huge significance of the technical measures, as they will influence the way fishermen and the sector as a whole do their work, by setting out the methods fishermen may use to catch fish in the zones covered by this regulation, with a view to protecting juveniles and restoring stocks: an aim shared by all, and by fishermen in particular. The subject of this report is sensitive and controversial, as demonstrated by the difficulties the Commission has come up against since 2008 in trying to reach an agreement with the Council on the future of these measures. This was when only those two institutions were involved in the procedure. At present, technical measures are governed by an old regulation that was amended by a succession of transitional measures and then renewed until 30 June 2011 as no agreement was reached with the Council on the Commission’s 2008 proposal for a new regulation, which was aimed at simplifying and clarifying the existing legislation to ensure the rules were implemented more effectively and to cater for the fisheries’ regional features. Today, as the new deadline approaches the situation is radically different. Since the Treaty of Lisbon, for the most part the subject of fisheries now falls under the ordinary legislative procedure, whereby Parliament has an important part to play as co-legislator. It fully intends to play its part by bringing the fishermen’s points of view and those of EU policy-makers closer together. As an elected representative from a port town, I am always struck by how the fishing sector mistrusts and sees itself as remote from the common fisheries policy (CFP), whereas farmers for example clearly feel themselves to be more a part of the common agricultural policy. Added to this, the fishing sector is in crisis. There is growing dissatisfaction. The real challenge is the balance that must be found between the sector’s economic stability and hence the guarantee of decent incomes for fishermen and the sustainability and replenishment of fish stocks. Finally, the expiration of the regulation comes at a time when talks on the reform of the common fisheries policy are starting. This reform must adopt a bold framework and must get the fishing community, consumers and citizens on board. It must involve the whole sector in the scientific analyses that form the basis for the quotas and hence the sector’s level of activity. This new framework presupposes that the Commission will draw up a concrete proposal on the future technical measures, an effort which at present both it and the Council appear to have been saving themselves. The new proposal must make provision to ensure that the technical measures are in keeping with real experience on the ground, through consultation with those working in the sector. It must also be in keeping with the new regulation and the framework of the new CFP, especially on the subject of regional variations in measures. It must ensure that the division of jurisdiction between the Commission and Member States is clearly defined, a factor which will aid understanding and ownership of this EU policy. In the light of this background and these issues, I propose that we agree to the Commission’s request for an extension until 31 December 2012, without substantially changing the current technical measures except for the addition regarding the permissible mesh size for boarfish. However, I realise that this proposal is a form of concession to the Commission and that there are a lot of questions being asked and a strong demand for change in the sector, which is disappointed that this important project has been postponed. I am therefore adding a twofold demand to our approval: a request for an impact assessment on the technical measures currently in force, which is vital if we are to adapt them effectively, and a request for genuine consultation with all of the parties involved, especially fishermen themselves, in drawing up the new regulation. To conclude, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the Commission’s new proposal should be made within a reasonable timescale for a new regulation to come into force on 1 January 2013, which is when the new CFP comes into force. It is vital that the Commission begin work immediately on this new proposal. It would be unreasonable to allow a further extension after this new 18-month extension period for the current regulation. The technical measures to which my report relates are transitional and have only been approved as such. Estelle Grelier,

 Mr President, I will do my best to speak more slowly – I promise.  (FR)
 Mr President, I would like to thank my fellow Members for their generally favourable comments on this report, which also echo the debates that took place during the meetings in the Committee on Fisheries. I share the Commissioner’s standpoint on accepting the amendment specifying the mesh size for boarfish nets and on not agreeing to any specific requests for amendments to certain technical measures, on the grounds that they are not supported by any impact assessments for the vessels and the ecosystems concerned, or because the Member States have not sent the necessary scientific data. These measures are all interconnected and have not been evaluated. I would like to stress, as previous speakers have done this evening, the urgency for the Commission to carry out an evaluation of the current measures as quickly as possible and on the basis of this evaluation to draw up a new proposal that can be dealt with at the same time as the reform of the common fisheries policy, rather than after it. I wanted to draw your attention to this point, Commissioner, and I note your readiness to speed up the drafting of the proposal. To conclude, I must mention once again the importance of joint work between the EU institutions and the fisheries sector on gathering and sharing the scientific data. I believe this is a necessary basis for a new, fair and collaborative common fisheries policy which has sufficient resources – and that is an important point – and which reconciles the economic necessities and the sustainability of the sector in the interests of all: the fishing community, consumers and citizens.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Balzani, for the consistency of her draft resolution on the general guidelines for the 2012 budget. This resolution sends a clear political message. It is because it is fully aware of the budgetary constraints affecting the European Union that Parliament is today calling for the adoption of a 2012 budget that can respond to the political, economic and social challenges we currently face. At a time when the sole topic of discussion among the Member States is the implementation of additional austerity measures, Parliament, at least on this side of the House, intends to demonstrate its commitment to the thousands of workers who, today, are marching through the streets of Brussels to show their rejection of these economically questionable and socially unjust measures, the result of which will be a further increase in structural unemployment in Europe. The fact that the European budget is being aligned with the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy, in a clear way for the first time in 2012, means that employment and growth can be put back at the heart of European policies, which I would point out are our priorities, since the EU 2020 Strategy has set the objective of an employment rate of 75% of the working population. However, let us not delude ourselves. This budgetary procedure will be a long and difficult one, contrary to what Mr Lewandowski indicated in the French press when he anticipated the position of the MEPs. The Member States have already expressed their short-term view of the budget, which advocates discipline, and have called for a limit on their contribution to financing Community action. They see the European Union and its action not as a means to achieve added value or as a means to help it achieve ambitious policies, but rather as an additional cost. Let us not be mistaken. The 2012 budgetary procedure will provide another insight into the tactics being used to define the future multiannual financial framework. The fact is, with a budget which accounts for a mere 2% of the EU’s public expenditure, it will be difficult to pursue ambitious policies in all sectors. We are already seeing stormy debates on whether it will be the CAP or cohesion policy that will be plundered. This pits citizens against each other when it would be to our credit to help them work in synergy. That is why, Commissioner, I would reiterate the importance of your communication on the implementation of own resources. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Here we are at the start of a difficult negotiation between Member States on the 2012 budget while, in the background, the debate is already underway on the post-2013 financial perspectives. At this time of crisis, it will be necessary throughout the budgetary process to reiterate our expectations with regard to European policies. Unlike some Council members who consider the EU to be an additional cost, an expense to be reduced at the risk of pitting current and future policies against each other, Parliament, through the resolution on general guidelines for the preparation of the 2012 budget, has reiterated its vision of the Union as a vector of added value and an ally of Member States in implementing ambitious policies. Furthermore, I voted in favour of the resolution presented by Mrs Balzani because of its consistency and the clear political message it carries, calling for the adoption of a budget that is consistent with the objectives for employment and growth of the EU 2020 Strategy. Finally, I took advantage of the debate in plenary to challenge the Commissioner for Financial Programming and the Budget on the urgent need for a communication on the implementation of new own resources, which, I hope, will carry this debate forward.

 In the absence of other alternative solutions proposed by the Council, it was necessary to vote in favour of making the European stability mechanism permanent, in order to provide assistance to our Greek, Portuguese and Irish colleagues. However, the debate is far from over. This concession made by the French socialists is not an indicator of the outcome of other forthcoming debates on the economic governance issue. Faced with the introduction of this intergovernmental mechanism, it is important to move forward and implement instruments which will encourage recovery in growth and business. It is, among other things, to ensure that we are able to finance such instruments that I am campaigning alongside my socialist colleagues for an increase in the European Union’s own resources. We could also use the Structural Funds in conjunction with the European stability mechanism to make deficit countries converge upwards. It is with ambitious budgets and the promotion of a European social model that we will be able to emerge from the crisis. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 The adoption of a parliamentary resolution on the draft strategy for the Atlantic region is an opportunity for me to point out the urgent need to work at European level on a common approach regarding the use of our maritime areas and to find a joint solution to the problems that exist. The Channel is a particularly illuminating example in this respect: a strategic maritime gateway to the European Union, it is both an essential link between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea (it contains 20% of the world’s fleet and more than 500 vessels over 300 tonnes sail through it every day) and an area dedicated to fishing, leisure activities, aggregate extraction and soon – much to my satisfaction – energy production from offshore wind farms. This concentration of activities calls for serious thought to be given to the issue of managing maritime safety in that area at European level, as part of a joint strategy. That is why, during the debate on the strategy for the Atlantic region, I once again called on Mrs Damanaki, Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, to include the Channel in the proposal that she is due to submit in June.

 The adoption of the Podimata report was the chance for Parliament to show unequivocal support for the introduction of a tax on financial transactions at European level. Until now, the European right had always frustrated the proposals by the socialists on this matter, whether in parliamentary committees or in plenary sessions. The fact that a majority of MEPs, and hence a section of the right, have been won over by this project, which has been advocated for many years by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is good news. It shows that, together, we are gradually becoming aware of the merits of this project. This vote marks a new stage in the process of introducing a financial instrument that would serve, in particular, to generate additional own resources for the EU budget, but also to support development initiatives internationally. However, the fight is not over. For the time being, this is only a policy position. Beyond their statements, we must remain alert to the genuine willingness of European Heads of State or Government, a large majority of whom are right-of-centre, to introduce this tax.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted with these plans for an integrated strategy for the Atlantic region. We need a common approach to the uses of our maritime spaces that takes the specific features of each basin into consideration and finds joint solutions to the problems that exist. In particular, as an elected representative of Normandy, I would like to draw your attention to the specific situation of the Channel, which must also be incorporated into the plans for an integrated strategy for the Atlantic region. The Channel is one of the European Union’s strategic maritime gateways and is an essential link between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea. It contains 20% of the world’s fleet and more than 500 ships over 300 tonnes sail through it every day. On top of this transport activity, there are also fisheries, leisure activities, aggregate extraction and soon – much to my satisfaction – energy production from offshore wind farms. This concentration of activities calls for serious thought to be given to the issue of managing maritime safety at European level, which I feel must be discussed as part of the Atlantic strategy also. As you know, the bilateral bases on which funding for safety is based are currently under threat. I have already alerted you to this point Commissioner and I will be paying close attention to the proposals you will be making in June. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Adopted in 2006, the Services Directive, which should have been transposed into national law before 28 December 2009, continues to raise questions in the Member States and within local authorities that are directly affected by it. The parliamentary own-initiative report by Mrs Gebhardt, which proposes an initial assessment of the directive’s implementation, thus touches on some of these difficulties, and especially the uncertainty surrounding social services and services of general economic interest (how are they defined? which areas are affected?), as well as the lack of transparency of the transposition process in some Member States. Moreover, it must be said that France stands out due to its problematic lack of transparency and inflexibility in implementing this directive. It has scores of decrees and implementing laws, and a restrictive interpretation of the exemptions set out in the directive, which raises doubts as to the future of some services, such as childcare and care for the disabled. Now more than ever, this own-initiative report, which has been adopted by a large majority, is an opportunity to point out that MEPs, and especially the Socialists, will continue to be vigilant with regard to the implementation of this directive and its impact on public services.

The adoption of the Commission’s proposal for a regulation setting emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles seems to me, more than anything, to be a gamble on the future. The compromise reached on limiting average CO2
 emissions to 147 g/km by 2020 does not meet the initial ambitions of my fellow Members on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, who had previously advocated a decidedly more ambitious objective (135 g/km). They were supported in this by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. Behind this ‘battle of numbers’, however, there is a balance to be struck between the environmental challenges that everyone recognises and certain social and industrial requirements which must not be forgotten. That is why it seems appropriate to me that the compromise will be adopted only following the revision of the regulation by January 2013 and only following the feasibility study and reassessment of the objectives. Not only will this revision allow us to return to this subject quickly and to go further in the fight against vehicle pollution, but it will also be an opportunity to address the issue of EU research and innovation in the field of road haulage. The date is set for 2012. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Today’s adoption of the 2011 budget has highlighted the European Parliament’s double failure. The budget that it adopted is too small: +2.91%, which falls far short of its first reading (+6%) and of the Commission’s initial proposal (+5.8%). The amounts adopted are exactly the same as those proposed with no real room for the Council to negotiate, hardly reassuring in terms of the negotiability of future budgets. Ever since the Treaty of Lisbon was implemented, Parliament has acted with the Council in codecision on budgetary matters: by not getting any precise commitment to date on the role that we, as MEPs, will have in preparing the next financial framework and on providing the necessary reflection on new own resources, we run the risk of allowing the Council to become lord and master over the future of the European project. So, given the positioning of certain Member States, there is a real risk that this project will flounder. What dismays me the most is the attitude displayed by the European right as they were more than determined at the start of negotiations to drop out the minute the telephones began ringing from Heads of State or Government. Everyone will make their own mind up about the political consistency of such a reversal. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 In my view, the EU Solidarity Fund, like the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, is one of the budgetary tools that give the strongest practical expression to the ‘solidarity’ value that we Members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament strive to promote when drafting Community policies. On 27 and 28 February 2010, storm Xynthia killed 53 and injured around 80 in Vendée and Charente-Maritime. It was a genuinely traumatic experience for the region and the nation, and its psychological and economic impact is still being felt 10 months later. As from the March 2010 plenary session, Parliament took action, adopting by a very large majority a resolution calling for the fund to be used to provide assistance to the victims. Today’s vote, which confirmed the release of EUR 35.6 million for these departments, as well as EUR 31.2 million for Portugal, which suffered flooding in Madeira caused by this storm, is an example of this common desire to show true solidarity between European citizens. This is the Europe we wish to build, a Europe close to its citizens, alert to the issues affecting them, and capable of addressing those issues collectively. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

We have here a case of coincidental timing: Parliament has been asked to give its opinion today on six requests for European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) assistance that have been submitted by the Netherlands while, at the same time, the 2011 budget negotiations are stalling because of the refusal by the Netherlands and by two other Member States to engage in a responsible and constructive dialogue on the future of the European budget. Today’s votes are therefore, in my view, an opportunity to point out that the European budget is not just an accounting tool that everyone finds daunting: it is, first and foremost, the ‘power’ behind the European Union that enables it to work day in day out to protect its citizens, and particularly through the EGF, to protect unemployed workers. The vote on the allocation of EGF aid to the Dutch workers could have been used as a ‘protest vote’ against the Dutch Government, which is criticising on the one hand what it is benefiting from on the other. Instead, it has been an opportunity for Parliament to recall that the principle of solidarity must be the foundation on which all EU decisions are made. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, as a result of the austerity policy conducted by the Cameron government, the United Kingdom has just decided to stop funding the large tugboats designed to assist and rescue ships in the English Channel, a unilateral decision that has been condemned by the port, maritime, trading and political bodies of that area. The announced withdrawal of the United Kingdom could have tragic repercussions for the maritime safety of this sector, which, with more than 250 000 vessels a year, is the busiest trading route in the world. Over the last 10 years, nearly 300 incidents have been recorded there, and experts believe that the pre-positioning of high-powered salvage vessels has prevented a number of these incidents from turning into major accidents. Since maritime safety affects the safety of EU territory and the protection of the environment, emergency towing is the responsibility of the public authority, with the financial assistance of shipowners, and must not be privatised for the benefit of private towing companies. The European Commission therefore has a duty to take up this matter. Indeed, Europe must afford itself the resources to implement the major integrated maritime policy that it is officially calling for. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 As a Member for a port town in Normandy, and member of the Intergroup for Seas and Coastal Affairs, I have followed the report on the integrated maritime policy (IMP) closely. On various occasions, I have emphasised the need for ensuring harmonious cohabitation between the different uses of the sea, one that promotes traditional activities (such as fishing, and I asked for it to be placed top of the list of maritime activities included in the report, as a symbolic gesture), and one that also facilitates the development of new activities. Thus I noted that the sector of renewable energies, including off-shore wind energy, should be supported in particular, because it is in line with European objectives around the diversification of sources of energy supply, and can, between now and 2020, mean a gain of 410 000 jobs in Europe, according to a study by the Commission. Finally, with the rapporteur, I amended the report to apprise the Commission of the need to fund the IMP. The initial exchanges within the Committee on ‘policy challenges and budgetary resources for after 2013’, of which I am a member, indeed raised doubts about the long-term funding of the regional cohesion policy, some of the programmes of which relate to the IMP.

Once again, Parliament has been asked to validate payment of aid from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to employees made redundant as a result of the crisis or relocations. Once again, this aid will be spread across budgetary lines initially allocated to other European programmes, as the Globalisation Adjustment Fund does not have any funds of its own within the current financial framework. In order to put an end to this situation, I worked, during the drafting of the 2011 budget, on the creation of a line of payment appropriations specific to the Globalisation Adjustment Fund. The sum of EUR 50 million was therefore adopted by Parliament during the vote on its reading of the budget on 20 October 2010. This sum, which is symbolic compared with annual requirements, has yet to be confirmed, as the European Council initially rejected the proposal to give the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund its own financing. I shall therefore continue to keep an eye on this question, in the hope of achieving budgetary and legislative consolidation of this mechanism. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as our debate again shows, we are all in agreement on one thing: the more Europe enlarges, the greater the powers entrusted to it, the more it displays its ambitions and the fewer resources it has to bring them to fruition. So everyone agrees on the diagnosis, but clearly we are not in agreement about what we need to do to extricate ourselves from this financial deadlock. As what was short-term has lasted, the Union budget has become a prisoner of national contributions, which make up almost 75% of its resources. Today, if we decided to raise the expenditure ceiling to the maximum threshold allowed by the treaties, this would mean an additional levy of more than 5 billion for countries like France and Germany. Everyone here clearly agrees that this is not possible. It is not a question of stepping up discipline, as it is the people and, principally, the poorest people who pay the highest price for the consequences of these national austerity policies. Considering that the financial sector bears the main responsibility for the crisis and explosion in public debt, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament proposes that a line of ‘own resources’ should be created funded by a financial transactions tax; this proposal was rejected within the Committee on Budgets by the right, which may make up for it tomorrow and bring its actions into line with the numerous statements they have made to the media in favour of this measure. It is a little more than two years since the fall of Lehman Brothers, and Parliament must not pass up an historic opportunity to create the foundations for a new development model, based on more lasting resources and certainly ones that are more just in terms of redistribution of wealth and solidarity. For the first budget voted on under the Treaty of Lisbon, this would send a strong political signal from our Parliament, which does not intend to make do with using its new codecision powers to manage penury, that is, to choose which of Peter or Paul is to go without clothing. Giving oneself the means, starting tomorrow, to increase the size of the Union budget, is to give oneself the means to pursue ambitious economic recovery, research, industrial, and employment policies. Let us not fail to grasp this opportunity that European citizens expect of us and which, in any case, the financial operators are expecting of us. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

I voted for Mrs Matera’s report on mobilising the Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the workers of the clothing industry in Spain. As I said in September during the debate on the EGF’s future after 2013, I am disappointed that this fund, set up to support workers made redundant ‘for reasons of recession or globalisation’, is currently not financially guaranteed in the European budget. Indeed, I do not believe that tapping into the financial resources of other European programmes to finance the EGF is a viable solution in the long run. Therefore, when the Committee on Budgets voted for mobilising the EGF for the Spanish employees mentioned in the Matera report, I pointed out, along with the Belgian Socialist MEP Mr Daerden, the need to work towards defining a separate budget heading for this funding. What is at stake here is the European Union’s credibility in supporting citizens affected by economic instability. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in brief, what does the European Commission’s proposal convey? First, a glaring lack of ambition. The Commission, supported by the Council, has refused to revise the multiannual financial framework, and has salved its conscience by proposing technical adjustments only – adjustments that were, in any case, inevitable, since they relate to the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon. Second, a breach of the undertakings given to Parliament. In fact, and this must be said, in 2006, Parliament accepted, albeit half-heartedly, what it had already, and quite rightly, understood to be an out-of-date financial framework, without room for manoeuvre; in short, one of resignation. It therefore made its support conditional on the guarantee of an in-depth overhaul of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) at the half-way stage. A fine demonstration of the lack of importance that the Commission and the Council attach to Parliament’s decisions, in paying no regard to them whatsoever – a Parliament, it must be remembered, that is sovereign and represents the people. Third, this proposal lays bare a paradox, namely one of increased powers, entrusted by the States to the Union, of large-scale projects, preferably European, within a budgetary framework that the Council and the Commission will not allow to evolve, even though they know it is not fit for purpose. They prefer to call on redeployment – a miracle cure in their eyes, but to mine, a narrow vision of the European project. What is more, how can we explain to the people of Europe without blushing that key projects are either not financed at all, such as the financial stabilisation mechanism, despite its heavy media coverage, or financed like the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), by tapping into heading 1a, which is intended for competitiveness, growth and employment, all policies meeting the public’s expectations? We are heading straight for the wall, while sounding the horn. Parliament knows it, and it is one of the virtues of the Böge report that it says so. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 I have supported this joint motion for a resolution because I am convinced that we urgently need to condemn the policy of the French Government, which has deliberately stigmatised an ethnic group by associating it directly with criminality, for the sole purpose of diverting attention away from the difficulties with its home affairs policy. This exploitation of the Roma issue is unacceptable in my view, and Parliament ought to react. Progressive Members, including the Social Democrats, have therefore demanded an end to this discriminatory rhetoric and to the collective expulsions, whereas the European right wing has largely supported the French Government in its drift to the right. We urgently need to implement a global strategy to tackle this subject, which affects 10-12 million EU citizens. This resolution deplores the lack of any reaction from the Commission, which is, however, supposed to be the guardian of the Treaties and as such should have condemned the French Government’s actions. The collective expulsions effectively make a mockery of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.

 I voted for the Portas Report. I support its main aim, which is to continue with the EGF, since, aside from the crisis we are going through, globalisation has a long-term adverse impact for our industrial jobs, which the European right refuses to accept. Furthermore, I helped amend this text so that SMEs and sub-contractors are taken into consideration when the EGF is allocated. Their employees are particularly vulnerable due to their dependence on multinationals, so it is vital that the EGF gives them real prospects for vocational retraining in the event of redundancy. I am also pleased that it has been recognised that studies need to be performed on the state bodies responsible for producing dossiers, so as to optimise utilisation of the EGF, which is often little-known and underused, particularly in France. Given that the European right has refused to continue the EGF after 2013, I will therefore fight in the debate on the next EU financial perspective for it to be kept permanently. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, it is a pity that the European budget, which should be a symbol of solidarity and the will to act together, has become a rigid tool, which the citizens do not understand and which lags behind the expectations of European society, incapable of being deployed to fight the social repercussions of the crisis. From this point of view, not a day passes without the media or a top-ranking politician talking about the need for a stronger European budget. Tension is increasing between revenue that is too modest, too dependent on the contributions of the Member States, and the money that the Union needs to spend in order to kick-start growth. For example, in the draft budget for 2011, the Commission simply presents a margin for manoeuvre of EUR 50 million to support new projects linked to employment and corporate competitiveness, which are top priorities. The revision of the financial framework is therefore a serious challenge for the future of the Union if we want to make it a real political and economic leader and also, and above all, a player that is closer to its citizens at a time when nearly 25 million of them are affected by unemployment. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Mr President, in essence, the vote on the budget is a profoundly political act, and we must learn a political lesson – a major, fundamental political lesson – from the budget being proposed to us. The European Union budget, and particularly this one, reflects the lack of a European political project even though, against a backdrop of crisis and at the start of our new mandates, European citizens need it more than ever. This budget marks the absence of a global vision for Europe. The Council and the Commission have chosen to let the Member States develop their own, often rival, recovery plans, and have abandoned efforts to coordinate an economic, social and environmental recovery at EU level. There has been no leverage attempt, no encouraging of European solidarity. The Council and the Commission are easing their consciences by applying a recovery plan bit by bit. Indeed, the 2010 budget provides funding for the second part of the recovery plan totalling EUR 5 billion, a derisory amount. Admittedly, it will allocate EUR 300 million to the milk fund, but this is insufficient when we know that in France, for example, the net income of farmers fell by 34% in 2009. The 2010 budget earmarks EUR 25 million for microfinance and, against the advice of the Council, allows the draft budget relating to Cohesion Fund interventions to be kept. It is therefore somewhat through the lack of an alternative and by default that we shall vote for this budget, because Europe – the citizens – cannot do without its interventions, however inadequate. Nevertheless, together, we must question – and this is urgent – the methods of financing the ambitious policies with which Europe must equip itself and of extracting the EU budget from its current restricted and unsuitable framework. Above and beyond major political declarations, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, must tell us how he intends to finance the future European policies about which he talks so much, particularly those relating to the new strategy on growth and to climate change. From now on they will be unable to make do with such a feeble budget as the one we are being offered. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, as an MEP from Normandy, I would like to draw the Commission’s and Parliament’s attention to the proposals on offshore Natura 2000 sites, which the French Government has just submitted to the European authorities. These proposals exclude the Antifer dyke situated near Etretat, but compensate for it by enlarging the perimeter to 12 nautical miles. This decision eases the way for Poweo to install a methane terminal at Antifer and restricts a project to create an offshore wind farm off Fécamp, despite the support shown for this project by local elected representatives, the population and even fishermen. A scientific and consistent proposal has been drafted for the region and has the backing of local operators. Under this proposal there will be six miles of zoning along the entire coastline, including Antifer. I have three questions: how much progress has the Commission made in examining the zoning proposals? Does it endorse them even though they go against scientific opinions and against the social, economic and cultural activities of the region? And, with the Copenhagen Summit approaching, can Europe reasonably endorse a decision that promotes gas at the expense of the development of renewable energies? Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 I voted against this appointment. France is preparing to make crucial progress on equal rights by adopting a law on marriage for all, at last joining several other Member States who have done the same. I believe that Tonio Borg’s appointment would contradict that progress in France and in Europe. His proposed portfolio – European Commissioner for Health – is fundamentally incompatible with his past statements and actions on contraception, abortion, and homosexual and transsexual rights. The holder of this position is meant to work for all European citizens, irrespective of their sex and their sexual orientation. Against a backdrop of particularly vicious comments and acts by extremists in France, appointing Tonio Borg would mean that Europe can accommodate such deviations. It is clear to all French Socialists that fundamental rights are not a matter for subsidiarity: they are universal. Irrespective of competence, this is an ethical matter: the European citizens have the right to expect Europe and the European Commissioners to defend these values without fail.

 In the opinion of the French Socialists, the national and European laws must be extremely strict, for example on extraction by hydraulic fracturing –the only type we are currently aware of – in order prevent any damage to the environment. It is not a question of denying the importance of energy independence and the effect of energy prices on the competitiveness of industry. Our priority must be to guarantee a high level of protection for human health and the environment. I regret that an amendment that I co-signed, calling for a European moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, did not obtain a majority today. Despite this setback, I welcome the action of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, which was crucial in ensuring the primacy of two particularly important principles: the precautionary principle and the ‘polluter pays’ principle.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to draw your attention to the case of Aurore Martin, the French citizen arrested in Spain and handed over to the Spanish authorities who is serving a 12-year prison sentence. Her crime consists in having participated in Spain in meetings of the Batasuna party, a party that is illegal in Spain but legal in France where it even has some elected representatives. She is the subject of a European arrest warrant that has been enforced. Although the establishment of the European arrest warrant in 2004 was greeted as the first step towards a European area of security and justice, today there are differences in its implementation that create inequalities between citizens of the European Union, and that is contrary to the very spirit of the framework decision establishing the European arrest warrant. Moreover, where there are important political implications, as in the case of this Basque activist, shouldn’t the European arrest warrant include broader exceptions and not be issued automatically so as to provide a better guarantee of fundamental rights, including the freedom of expression, which has been prejudiced in the case of Aurore Martin?

 Our votes have shown that the majority of Members did not favour transferable fishing concessions (TFCs) aimed at liberalising the fishing industry. The adopted text still, unfortunately, makes reference to TFCs, but they are now optional. A more watered-down position has also been adopted on the compulsory landing of discards; what is currently under consideration is a gradual implementation on a case-by-case basis, taking account of the different characteristics and realities of the fisheries. While the landing of all incidental catches and by-catches was to be approved in the basic regulation, we have also achieved the guarantee of financial compensation for fishing professionals in the text on the common market organisation. Finally, a compromise was reached in relation to maximum sustainable yield, so that this rate could be applied at the latest in 2020, and not in 2015. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 Parliament has today approved a directive on energy efficiency that should enable us to aim for energy savings of 20% by 2020, which represents considerable progress. I particularly welcome the fact that the directive specifies a series of compulsory measures that contribute to the goal of energy efficiency. These include renovating public buildings, a strategy to encourage investment in renovating housing stock and commercial premises, cogeneration, energy saving certificates, and so on. The Commission has also agreed to publish a list of additional sectoral initiatives in order to ensure that the overall target of 20% energy savings by 2020 is really achieved. The course has been set; it is now up to Member States to implement this directive as quickly as possible. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

We must detect, assess and prevent the undesirable effects of medicines that are put on the market in the European Union, and we must do so at European level. Following the Mediator affair, the Commission implemented a ‘stress test’ which allowed us to identify weaknesses in current legislation. The present revisions are the result of this process. The improvements made today are numerous: most notably, the introduction of an automatic urgent procedure, the creation of a new trigger mechanism for the urgent procedure and the clarification of the transparency obligation of companies. The European regulation marks a significant step towards increased health security for Europeans, and we welcome that. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 I voted against this useless and dangerous text, whose only worth is that it has instigated pan-European debate and highlighted the democratic checks in place in Europe to tackle the relentless lobbying of some of the large multinationals. Today, not only have we voted against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), we have actually voted for European democracy. Showing little regard for the EU’s Treaties, citizens and democratic principles, the Commission has been negotiating the ACTA behind Parliament’s back since 2007. The exploitation of the Court of Justice of the European Union is just the latest blatant disregard for the democratic balance which we at the European Parliament uphold.

 Earlier today, we voted in favour of the general introduction of eCall, an in-vehicle emergency call system. This system, which is public and open, could contribute significantly to reducing the road death toll. That is why we have been advocating it since 2003. Unfortunately, for commercial reasons, car manufacturing lobbies want to impose private optional systems, which was supported by France’s former government which did not wish to invest in the scheme, and by several French MEPs from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Saving a life does indeed have a financial cost, but it is our duty as European law makers to show that, with a high-performance safety system, the EU can and must protect citizens. We are now waiting for the Commission to propose legislation quickly so that the system can become operational throughout the European Union by 2015. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

Mr President, at this time, many things have been said. Commissioner, I should personally like to express my most heartfelt thanks. Thanks to your stubbornness, your craftiness with regard to procedure, you have given us the opportunity to prove how important Parliament is as colegislator. Thank you, Commissioner, for having driven hundreds of thousands of citizens out into the streets to protest and 2.8 million people to sign petitions. They have discovered that democracy is played out here, that European elected representatives are the representatives of the people, their representatives. Thank you again for the millions of Internet users who have followed the debates and the votes in committee and who are still following us today. I would like to welcome them. It is a breath of fresh air in our institutions, which are all too often perceived as technocratic. Thank you, Commissioner, but in democracy, there is also another principle. It is the fundamental principle, the principle of responsibility.

 Madam President, we will be holding a debate on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) tomorrow, but I wanted to raise an issue this evening which, although peripheral to the subject, I feel is extremely important. I am referring to what Commissioner De Gucht told the Committee on International Trade at its meeting on Wednesday 20 June. I quote: ‘If you decide on a ‘no’ vote before the European Court of Justice has handed down its ruling, let me tell you that the Commission will nonetheless continue with the proceedings currently before the Court. We have committed to this. A ‘no’ vote will not halt the proceedings before the Court of Justice’. Not only do his words disregard the treaties, in my view, but, above all, and this is what I want to condemn, they demonstrate an unacceptable disregard for the European Parliament, for democracy in general, and for the voters we represent.

 Today, Parliament has adopted a proposal for a regulation on food intended for infants and young children and on food for special medical purposes. We socialists are delighted to have achieved a strengthening of the provisions on food intended for vulnerable people, stricter rules on composition and labelling and a framework for food being placed on the market. Another important advancement we have achieved is the creation of a single list at EU level specifying the vitamins and minerals that may be added to foods. My only reservation is that the draft legislation excluded ‘growing milks’ used for children aged one to three. For the socialists, it is important that dairy products intended for young children are also covered by this legislation. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 Parliament has expressed its view on the implementation of the proposals contained in the Single Market Act. By way of a reminder, in April 2011, the Commission presented 50 actions to be carried out by 2014 to build a single market focused on the citizens. In line with the socialists’ amendments to the resolution, I condemn the tenor of the Commission’s recent legislative proposals and communications: a very liberal vision is revealed in the Commission’s proposals, which focus on facilitating business to the detriment of measures aimed at jobs and the citizens. I welcome the fact that Parliament has supported the priorities held by the socialists, such as the rejection of social dumping, the promotion of quality jobs, defence of the social protection model, the fight against tax evasion, but also an ambitious growth initiative based on the social market economy.

 At a time when the Council ought to be discussing a growth initiative, along with the other weighty issues, we need to bear in mind Europeans’ main expectation: keeping a job or finding a new one. The social situation is getting more difficult every day. We are facing the threat of a lost generation: 5.6 million young people are unemployed, that is one young European out of every five. We socialists welcome the Commission’s new attitude towards several issues, such as the minimum wage, which, until now, have been taboo.

 The PIP breast implants scandal – which broke in March 2010 – has brought to light the serious malfunctions in European health safety. These tragedies are forcing us to carry out an in-depth review of the functioning of the European and national bodies responsible for health matters. Parliament’s reaction is in line with the gravity of the scandal: the resolution, which I voted for, calls for greater cooperation between Member States and greater control measures for medical devices placed on the market. This is an ambitious resolution in my view, as it also calls on the Commission to consider a system of pre-market authorisation for certain categories of medical devices. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this text, which reviews the scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP). The European Union has granted trade preferences to developing countries since 1971. These provisions are regularly adapted to take account of each country’s economic growth. Today’s vote is the first review of this system under the codecision procedure. In fact, we could barely have hoped for the compromise agreed with the Council, given the vastly differing positions of the Member States. For French Socialists, this text succeeds on two key issues: ensuring that the large emerging countries no longer benefit from preferential access to the EU market and facilitating exports from the poorest countries. This new trade regime will therefore enable us to provide better support to developing countries and it will be a step forward in our fight for fair trade as it will officially exclude the emerging countries almost entirely.

 I voted for the adoption of the Podimata report on the introduction of a financial transaction tax (FTT). Since the current crisis was brought on by stock market and financial speculation, I therefore consider it logical and just that this tax is finally introduced. The latest Eurobarometer survey shows that 66% of Europeans are in favour of such a tax. Furthermore, the FTT and the new resources to which it leads must contribute to financing growth in Europe. From this perspective, we must defend a tax base that is as broad as possible and fight against exemptions and loopholes which would favour speculators. In this regard, I regret the overcautiousness of the European right wing, which preferred to exclude pension funds, as if that financial instrument could not, like any other financial instrument, be at the service of speculation!

 I voted for the adoption of this report, which calls for the establishment of more balanced and fairer trade relations between the European Union and China, because I take the view that globalisation must not be based on unfair competition. The aim of this text is to urge China, the second-biggest trading partner of the European Union, to respect not only the principle of reciprocity in terms of trade, but also the principles of balance and compliance with social and environmental standards. Furthermore, it is necessary to rebalance access to China’s internal market to bring it into line with that of the EU, which is much more open and transparent. That is why the EU must establish a genuine strategy to promote ‘fair trade’ and to protect its industries and some of its sectors from social and environmental dumping, which is practised by some of its partners, most notably China.

 I voted in favour of the compromise text, negotiated with the Council, on the ‘roaming’ regulation, which will mean Europeans pay less to use their mobile phones abroad. As the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, we have called for the removal of these artificial borders within the internal market because they go against the very spirit of the European project and its founding fathers. That is why we urged the Commission to act quickly to effectively end roaming from 2016. As well as applying lower mobile roaming tariffs than those currently being charged from July, the text introduces, for the first time ever, structural solutions that will enable consumers to freely choose another operator for roaming services, separately from their domestic operator, from July 2014.

 I voted against this agreement. Although the fight against terrorism is a major challenge for the European Union as it is for its partners, we believe that it should not be pursued at the expense of the fundamental freedoms of citizens. However, this compromise, far from respecting the principle of proportionality, did not offer sufficient progress in terms of protecting privacy to persuade me to support it. All the more so as it appears to be difficult to gauge how effective the control and data storage measures are in the face of terrorist acts which are frequently not very sophisticated. Furthermore, while these data should strictly only be used as part of the fight against terrorism, in reality the purposes for which they can be used are very broad and very ill-defined. The retention period, the need for anonymisation and deletion, as well as the right of access, correction and deletion for the citizens concerned, are also important reasons for my rejection of this agreement. As Ms Guillaume pointed out, this is an unfortunate situation because this agreement should, on the contrary, have provided the opportunity to ensure that high data protection standards prevail, as behoves the European Union.

 I voted for this motion for a resolution. Water is a ‘shared resource’ and access to water should constitute a fundamental and universal right. All local authorities must be able to use the management method of their choice. On this subject, many people are strongly criticising the European Union, its institutions and in particular the Commission for being responsible for privatisations, but we must remember that, at present, there is no compulsory European ‘internal market’ directive, as is the case for other public service networks. We will ensure that the European Union does not commit to liberalisation policies and, on the contrary, guarantees free democratic choice for all public authorities in terms of their organisation and management methods.

Madam President, Commissioner, I am joining my colleagues to call for the issue of collective management societies to be dealt with quickly. I agree with the proposals you have just made regarding the harmonisation of horizontal rules on transparency and regarding the rules on online music. However, I must insist on the aim of fair remuneration for artists. Since the start of the mandate, for several years even, the issue of remuneration for artists has been mentioned exclusively in the context of infringements to intellectual property rights, making Internet users the scapegoats for artists’ lack of earnings. Yet, we are forgetting that, for each CD, for example, authors and performers only receive, on average, 6% of the sales price and that, for websites that sell music online, they receive hardly anything, around 1% per sale. Fair remuneration for artists must therefore be at the heart of our revision of collective management for the digital era. Of course, we need more transparency. In France, the Standing Monitoring Committee for management societies and distribution of rights published a damning report last year on the remuneration of the managers of these societies, for example. This committee also denounced a wave of invoices and deductions for costs. Artists must be at the heart of our concerns and many voices from all of the political camps together are denouncing a system which, in the end, places more importance on intermediaries than artists — that is what Neelie Kroes said — or even an opaque, confiscatory system as the French Minister of Culture has branded it. Commissioner, I therefore think that, if we revise these collective management rights, our objective and our end goal must be the optimal perception of intellectual property rights. These are conditions which are not merely incidental in the fight against infringements to intellectual property rights but which represent an essential prerequisite to the respect of these rights by users.

 I abstained. As my colleague, Estelle Grelier, so rightly said, this 2012 budget is, in fact, a Council budget, with just a ‘bit of soul’ added by the European Parliament. We are not fooled by the Council’s ploy: the Member States’ main preoccupation is to impose austerity, but they will not openly admit to the impact that this choice will have on EU policies on the ground. In order to cope with the recession that European citizens are enduring, while States are having trouble funding themselves and austerity policies abound, we need an EU budget that will meet this challenge at the very least, and allow us to implement policies for regeneration. Employment and growth in Europe are at stake. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 Today the European Parliament adopted the ‘economic governance’ package, after lengthy negotiations. For us, French and European socialists, it represents an austerity pact that prevents the Member States from kick-starting the economy and protecting themselves from the markets. In the end, only the proposals made by our colleague Elisa Ferreira will enable us to deliver specific solutions to the macroeconomic imbalances that undermine the sustainability and social bases of the euro area. We refuse to accept that Greece should be made solely responsible for the worsening of the economic divergences within the euro area. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 The European Parliament today adopted the Matias report which aims to establish a new strategy for research and innovation. As someone committed to the idea of progress, I believe that investment in research and innovation is fundamental to improving each of our lives. While I am delighted that there are several European programmes in this area, I, like my socialist colleagues, am convinced that numerous aspects could be improved upon: excessive bureaucracy, barriers to risk-taking by researchers, complexity, etc. All of this makes participating in these programmes difficult, particularly for SMEs.

 I voted in favour of this report. Today, Parliament reaffirmed its wish to see social, environmental and human rights standards made compulsory and legally binding in all trade agreements concluded by the EU. Faced with pleas from our fellow citizens for more regulation and new forms of solidarity, the EU must redefine a new doctrine for a different kind of trade policy. If Europe does not champion fairer trade based on values, and which creates quality jobs in Europe as well as the rest of the world, who else will? Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 The introduction of this common platform of rights for all consumers within the Union represents a real step forward for the citizens of other countries where consumer information requirements are not as high and where the period for withdrawal is less well protected. However, it has given mixed results, as the aim of the Commission and the European right has been above all to facilitate cross-border trade, and not to harmonise upwards consumer protection. It is therefore a small step for the French consumer but a big step for the European consumer. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 We, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialist and Democrats in the European Parliament, introduced radical changes to the draft produced by the German conservative rapporteur of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), regarded by many as woefully inadequate, and we succeeded in obtaining a majority in the European Parliament on the objective of a fairer allocation of agricultural payments. The abolition of historical reference values, aid to farmers with small farms, a rebalancing in favour of the livestock sector and, above all, the adoption of the principle of the degressivity of direct payments, taking employment and the environment into account, represent crucial progress in this regard. I welcome the work carried out, which will also have made it possible to put in place tools committing agriculture to move towards more sustainable development, while taking into account the objectives of food security, the environment, territories and jobs. The greening of payments of the first pillar will also make it possible to encourage farmers to adopt good farming practices and to be more economically and ecologically efficient. Dacian Cioloş, Member of the European Commission responsible for Agriculture and Rural Development, must now use this report to put forward some good proposals by the end of this year.

 I voted in favour of the report. Some Member States, including France, Germany and the Netherlands, want to change the rules of the game. However it is not reasonable to add other criteria such as an assessment of policies on combating corruption and crime.

 I voted in favour of this report. The great virtue of this report is to seek to mobilise all the EU’s budgetary resources in a coherent fashion and as a means to achieve the Europe 2020 strategy, and to take a stand that is diametrically opposed to the narrow approach of most Member States. While these Members bring Europe down to the common denominator of their contributions, which they would like to see fall, and of its financial returns, which they would like to see increase, this report argues for strong, integrated community policies, both in terms of long-standing policies and in terms of the new competences entrusted under the Treaty of Lisbon.

 Mr President, Commissioner, we can see that the application of the European Arrest Warrant raises the issue of detention which is very unevenly applied from one Member State to another. Some States show demonstrable laxity when it comes to respecting fundamental rights in a prison environment. Furthermore, amongst the 600 000 prisoners in the European Union, increasing numbers are detained in a Member State other than their own, due, precisely, to the European Arrest Warrant. Consequently, they do not enjoy the fundamental rights guaranteed by their state of origin. In circumstances such as these, there is no point in hurling abuse at each other; action must be taken. That is why, last January, my colleague, Mr Lambrinidis and I submitted a written statement calling for the harmonisation of detention standards throughout the European Union, and the introduction of independent national inspection mechanisms. I hope, Commissioner, that in the Green Papers that you will propose, you will bear this issue in mind, and that there will soon be a common platform of minimum rights which applies to all Member States.

I voted in favour of this report, not with the aim of putting up protectionist barriers, but because we can no longer have a situation in which the European Union is the only one respecting the rules of the game. We can no longer ignore social and economic dumping in emerging countries, China in particular, which are winning contracts with rock-bottom prices in the countries of the Union, without regard for social rights and legislation on State aid, whereas the markets of these countries remain inaccessible to European companies. We can no longer be naïve: the survival of our businesses and our jobs depends on this. Finally, I am pleased that the amendments submitted by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament concerning respect, in the context of public contracts, for the labour, social and environmental standards in force in the Member States, have largely been adopted. That demonstrates real awareness and represents a positive and necessary change. It is now for the Commission to assess this call fully. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

I voted in favour of this report to enable the transformation of a report which is all too often about exploitation and the law, in an area which represents between 5 and 9% of all jobs within the European Union. All those who work with our elderly people must be able to enjoy freedom of association and rest time, and must not be subject to harassment and arbitrary practices. That is why we wanted to send a strong message of support to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the trades unions prior to the negotiations on the adoption of these new instruments, which will commence in June at the 100th International Labour conference. We regret, however, that the right is happy to express concerns about illegal domestic workers while refusing to recognise that all too often, such situations involve workers with no papers, who are the main victims of precarity and abusive practices.

 I voted in favour of this report, which will enable the exponential demand for access to high frequency-consuming mobile Internet to be met in the short term, in particular, through the allocation of the entire 800 MHz band, freed up by the changeover to digital television in our various countries, to electronic communications services. In the medium to long term, our aim must be to improve the use of spectrum across the board, by recognising its social, cultural and economic value. At the same time, we are promoting innovative technologies (femtocells, cognitive technologies) in order to respond qualitatively to the demand for use of frequencies. This will contribute to the objectives that the Union has set itself, including that of bridging the digital divide, so as to ensure that all Europeans have broadband access by 2015.

 I voted in favour of this report as it is important to clarify matters at a time when the role of lobbies is still giving rise to much debate and, at times, conjecture among European citizens. We regret, however, that the registration of organisations has not been made compulsory, especially as it is a de facto
 obligation to register in order to receive a card to enter our premises. On the other hand, we have fought to ensure that the offices representing local, regional and municipal authorities in the European institutions are not affected by this measure, contrary to what was planned in the initial text. We consider these structures to be the direct product of democratically elected bodies. They represent the general interest, and should therefore be distinguished from lobbyists, who defend individual interests. Nevertheless, this register is an important step forward because, in many areas, the lack of transparency surrounding the role of lobbies can present a real democratic problem.

 I voted against this report. We want a free trade agreement between the EU and India that helps to promote sustainable development, and that is accompanied by clear clauses concerning respect for ILO standards, environmental rules and corporate social responsibility obligations. The right’s rejection of these requests is particularly regrettable. We also deplore the fact that the right-wing in Parliament rejected the amendment designed to ensure equal treatment of European and Indian workers. This is not only harmful to Indian workers; it is also very dangerous for European workers. We must not accept the liberalisation of services and social dumping aimed at bringing down European wages. Moreover, the European Union must not forget its founding principles. The Treaty of Lisbon stipulates that trade policy must contribute to sustainable development, eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 I voted against this joint motion for a resolution.

I also voted in favour of the amendments calling for investment in research and innovation, in order to promote energy saving and greatly increase the number of renewable forms of energy. However, the outcome of the vote – the incoherent vote – forced me to vote against the amended resolution.

 The European Union’s trade policy should be consistent with the general objectives set out in the Treaty on European Union and contribute to sustainable development, employment and social progress in Europe and in its partner countries, as well as to a form of globalisation in which human and social rights are respected. Ms Jaakonsaari’s report on a new enhanced partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and Kazakhstan points to the latter’s serious shortcomings with regard to democracy and human rights, in particular workers’ rights. It states that, in order to tackle these practices, which are incompatible with the objectives of the European Union, the trade component of the agreement must include a binding chapter on compliance with social, democratic and environmental standards. I call on the Commission to apply the recommendations set out in this report in the ongoing negotiations. In the event of serious breaches of human rights, the European Union should not be afraid to invoke all conditionality clauses included in the agreement and, if need be, to suspend it temporarily. This conditionality is a prerequisite for maintaining a fair external policy and even-handed trade policy. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 In the resolution on public procurement, the European Parliament has strengthened the Commission’s proposal towards a social Europe: the most significant step forward is that authorities should no longer opt for the lowest bid, but for the most economically advantageous tender – one which includes, for example, environmental aspects. Likewise, the issue of subcontractors is taken into account in order to prevent abuse in relation to working conditions and workers’ safety. Nevertheless, there is still progress to be made where European public procurement policy is concerned. In particular, the Commission must impose the principle of reciprocity on its trading partners: if the Union agrees to open up its public procurement markets to third-country operators, then European companies should also have access to markets and public works in these countries outside the EU. European companies and employment in Europe must be a priority when business opportunities are looked at. The Commission must ensure that its forthcoming Public Procurement Directive serves the dual purpose of providing more quality jobs and offering quality services to users. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Since its inception in 2001, the World Trade Organisation’s Doha trade negotiation round has had the task of redressing the balance of world trade rules in favour of developing countries. These negotiations have now stalled. Various factors have contributed to the stand-off, for which all parties bear some responsibility, but it is developing countries that will be hit hardest by the failure of the negotiations. Every effort must be made to conclude the negotiations, but also to take into account the concerns raised, not least by developing countries, and particularly the situation in sensitive industries and in agriculture, where food security for citizens must be the priority. Public services should still be governed by each country to reflect the public interest, rather than being liberalised as part of enforced horse-trading with no reference to social needs. Subject to these conditions, the conclusion of the Doha Round is both desirable and necessary. The proliferation of bilateral agreements – like those currently under negotiation – will prevent us from establishing clear and fair rules. Multilateralism is still the best framework for ensuring fair trade that will encourage sustainable development across all continents. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the comprehensive economic and trade agreement negotiated with Canada will strengthen our links with a large and long-standing EU partner country. We welcome this, but we must keep track of all its consequences, not just the benefits it will bring for certain economic sectors or certain major international investors. In particular, the agreement must respect the social and environmental models of both parties – of the EU Member States and of Canada – and their capacity to continue to legislate in what are sensitive areas for our societies. These are not mere details or points to be left for another day. As regards public services, the Commission’s chosen ‘negative list’ approach is dangerous. It is far too broad and ill-defined, and we would not like to see it set a precedent. Also, from a general point of view, the chapter on investment must respect both parties’ right to legislate in areas such as the environment, public health, employee and consumer rights, industrial policy and cultural diversity, among others. We call on the Commission to exclude sectors such as culture, education and public health from the scope of the agreements. In this respect, and as other Members have said, the intellectual property part should not call into question issues relating to generic medicine production. As for the environment, we are concerned and call for investment. As regards the impact of the agreement on oil sands drilling, the agreement must not have the effect of weakening European legislation on the application of the Fuel Quality Directive, nor must it limit the possibility for Canada to regulate drilling of its oil sands in the future under its environmental remit. We also call on the Commission – we are asking the question, anyway – to monitor the impact on the fisheries sector in areas such as St Pierre and Miquelon. These are areas of Europe that could be severely affected by the complete liberalisation of that sector. Lastly, I echo Mr Kazak in saying that the sustainable development chapter must include social and environmental commitments and, in particular, social and environmental responsibility on the part of large multinationals.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-India free trade agreement negotiations are ambitious, they concern many economic sectors, but they are also a cause for concern in Europe and in India, as I was able to see during last month’s meeting between the trade committee of the two chambers of the Indian Parliament and the European Parliament’s delegation for relations with India. India is booming; it is a strategic partner, as you have reminded us. Everyone understands the importance of developing trade between us. Yet we are not starting from scratch, since the Union is already India’s main trading partner, the main investor in India and the main destination for Indian investors, and India is also the main beneficiary of the system of generalised preferences. We will therefore have to be alert to any new impact that a new and more far-reaching trade agreement may have on fragile sectors of the Indian economy. I am thinking, for example, of agriculture – our Indian colleagues spoke to us about this – and of the consequences for sectors that are particularly exposed to competition from emerging countries in Europe, and I am thinking of the car industry. Such an agreement should serve the development of our societies and of employment and not give rise to uncontrolled liberalisation that would have disastrous effects. That is why my group wishes to emphasise a number of points in these negotiations, which should culminate in an agreement that helps achieve the objectives of sustainable development and poverty eradication, and which should also be accompanied by clear and verifiable commitments, on the basis of cooperation, of course, but then coupled with serious social and environmental commitments. I should like to emphasise a few points in particular. Firstly, regarding agriculture – which I mentioned earlier – we call on the Commission to ensure that none of the agreement’s provisions, either on the liberalisation of agricultural trade or on intellectual property rights, threaten small-scale farming in India. I am thinking of the provisions on seeds, for example. Secondly, regarding generic medicines, India is the biggest producer of generic medicines in the developing world. We call on the Commission to stop demanding data exclusivity, since all the NGOs say it is liable to harm the distribution of those medicines. Thirdly, in the area of services, we call, firstly, for public services to be left out of the sectors to be liberalised and, secondly, concerning mode IV, for the principle of equal treatment to be guaranteed – in other words, for all forms of social dumping to be rejected. Lastly – thank you, Mr President – we believe that the sustainable development chapter must include binding commitments in relation to respect for social and environmental standards, in particular, ILO social standards.

 The report by Mrs Guillaume is an important step towards the revision of EU rules on asylum and protection for applicants for 2012. In view of the terrible tragedies that have taken place, such as the recent sinking of a Libyan boat off Lampedusa, this revision is vital, particularly considering that an applicant’s chances of obtaining asylum may differ greatly according to the Member State. With this text, we are calling on the European Commission to include in the proposed revision the right to free legal advice from the start of the procedure; better consideration of vulnerable applicants, such as unaccompanied minors; and a framework for the time limit for appeals. My one regret, however, is that the European right adopted a tightening of accelerated procedures based on the notion that asylum seekers are primarily potential fraudsters, limiting their rights. However, the adoption of Mrs Guillaume’s report sends a clear signal to the Council and Commission that they need to work to guarantee all asylum seekers in Europe decent, fair conditions and procedures.

Too often, the European Union is distant from its citizens, its policies seem far removed, and the European project lacks meaning in the eyes of Europeans. If the Single Market is only to be a conduit for rampant liberalisation, deregulating public services, social systems and workers’ rights by submitting them to fierce competition, this is a cause for concern, even though it has and may have several positive specific consequences for consumers and in the everyday lives of our fellow citizens. With Mr Correia de Campos’s report, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have fought for better regulation when it comes to strengthening the Single Market, and for this strengthening to serve the general interest of Europeans and not just that of businesses. Such interests include consumers’ rights, the protection of workers’ rights against the tendency towards social dumping, with an explicit recognition of collective labour agreements in all the Member States of the Union, the call for a recognised framework for public services, and universal access to these services. The integration of the Single Market must now go hand in hand with the advances of a social Europe, which is needed more than ever at a time when the recession continues to affect Europeans.

 For over 10 years, the European socialists have been fighting in the European Parliament for a tax on financial transactions. This tax would have many benefits: not only would it discourage financial speculation; it would also fund aid to developing countries and their adaptation to climate change, while contributing to the European Union’s budget. The world is now in a different situation: the recession has made the need to stabilise the financial markets yet more acute, and the European Union needs new resources to overcome this recession – it must overcome it by means of a recovery, not by means of austerity. At the same time, the groundswell in favour of the tax is getting bigger: more and more governments are supporting the idea, and the European Parliament has already voted repeatedly in favour of introducing a tax on financial transactions. This new vote in favour of the tax is an important step: Parliament is saying that we must act immediately at European level, even if there is no global agreement. Parliament’s request is clear, and the vote was an overwhelming one: we must now turn our words into deeds and implement the tax on financial transactions. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Over the last few months, the Lithuanian Parliament has passed a series of laws forbidding or punishing any reference to homosexuality or bisexuality in public. A bill currently being debated in the Parliament aims to amend the Code of Administrative Offences to punish ‘the public promotion of homosexual relations’ with fines of up to EUR 2 900. This legislation is in complete breach of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and of the European Union Treaties which commit the EU and its Member States to upholding freedom of expression and fundamental freedoms and to providing European instruments to fight discrimination and human rights violations. In adopting this resolution, we are calling for this bill to be withdrawn, for respect for sexual orientation to be included in the list of principles protected under the country’s Law on Education, for minors to have the right to freely access information about sexual orientation and for clarification of the prohibition stipulated in the country’s Law on Advertising. This is not the first time that a Member State has impeded European citizens’ rights and freedoms regarding sexual orientation under the pretext of non-interference, thus, in effect, encouraging discrimination.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to begin by thanking my colleagues in the Committee on International Trade and, in particular, the shadow rapporteurs from the various groups for their cooperation in the drafting of this third report on a related topic. Today, we are able, thanks to this cooperation, to present a set of innovative, concrete proposals to move corporate social responsibility forward within the framework of EU trade policy. After the international crisis and the economic and social damage it caused, and after the debates it prompted, the expectations voiced by the public and the political expectations for lessons to be learnt, our common conviction is that Europe’s trade policy must contribute more than ever to the objectives of regulating globalisation and, in particular, to its social and environmental objectives. This regulation concerns the States and their economies, but it is clear that the main economic players are undertakings and, in particular, multinational corporations: they are the main players in world trade. They are the ones that have benefited most from market liberalisation, not only in terms of gaining access to customers, but also in order to externalise part of their production and to diversify their supply arrangements, often by drawing on countries where production costs are low and, above all, where social and environmental rules are applied less rigorously. The liberalisation of trade has been accompanied by fierce competition among countries seeking to attract foreign investors and by stiffer competition between undertakings. All too often this has led to unacceptable abuses in relation to working conditions, and to human rights violations and environmental damage. From the Bhopal disaster at the subsidiary of a chemical multinational in India, which claimed thousands of victims and for which the parent company has still not been punished to this day, to the behaviour of oil and mining companies in Africa, in Burma, and in many other countries, which is destroying their environment and reducing their workers to the rank of slaves; and from child labour in Asian textile factories to the murder of trade unionists on agricultural holdings in Central America, the examples are legion. And they are all the more unacceptable given that they often concern undertakings from industrialised countries, their subsidiaries and their supply chain, including European undertakings. This gave rise, many years ago, to a debate and a campaign which, I might add, was supported on several occasions within this Parliament through the adoption of resolutions on corporate social and environmental responsibility. The progress made in corporate social responsibility (CSR) is not yet on a par with the debate on social standards in trade agreements, the subject of the report by Mrs Saïfi. This is understandable, because trade agreements concern legal rules that are binding among the States, whereas corporate social responsibility concerns voluntary commitments by undertakings. At the same time, however, it is paradoxical, because CSR and the social and environmental clauses pull in the same direction, namely, towards globalisation which is more respectful of human rights and the environment and which is conducive to sustainable development. We therefore propose to incorporate CSR into trade agreements and, specifically, to incorporate a corporate social responsibility clause into the chapters on sustainable development, especially of free trade agreements (FTA), with a number of clear and verifiable commitments by undertakings. First, there must be a reciprocal commitment between the European Union and its partners to encourage undertakings to enter into CSR commitments and to verify them: the establishment of contact points not only to foster the provision of information but also to receive complaints from trade unionists and civil society; a requirement for corporations to publish their balance sheets regularly, which will reinforce transparency; a reporting requirement; and a requirement for undertakings to show due diligence and to take preventive measures. Finally, we propose that, in the event of serious breaches of the principles underpinning CSR and also of the violation of social rights and social and environmental laws, there should be mechanisms ...

 Mr President, as you can see, I had two minutes left. You knew this, so, if you had a time issue earlier, you could have deducted the time from this part of my speech, which could have been shorter. I should especially like to thank my colleagues and the Commissioner for his reply. What has been striking in this debate is the very broad consensus extending beyond the differences between groups. This is, however, qualified by the need to genuinely take greater account of the social and environmental dimensions in trade policy, in the agreements we negotiate. When you cut me off for your very interesting speech, which I am sure our fellow citizens throughout the Union will have found fascinating, I simply wanted to raise a point that the Commissioner himself raised, which is that corporate social responsibility cannot – he is absolutely right – replace compliance with the law and the responsibilities of the Member States. Furthermore, Mr De Gucht is also right when he says that, at this very moment, within the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and also within the World Trade Organisation (WTO), as a result of Professor Ruggie’s report, which Mr Howitt mentioned, new steps have been proposed with regard to the responsibility of multinational companies, not only in relation to mining but also in many other areas of responsibility – especially as regards their foreign subsidiaries – within their spheres of influence or throughout their supply chains. Judicial cooperation will also ensure that a parent company cannot evade its responsibilities in relation to the action of one of its subsidiaries or of a subcontractor, when it has infringed environmental or social rules. All of this is absolutely critical. I simply believe, though I admit it will be difficult, that we must establish a link with trade agreements. There are already a small number of references to corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the agreement with Korea and in the agreements with Latin American countries. I believe that, through the dialogue we have begun today with the Commission, we must continue to ensure that our CSR objectives and our sustainable development objectives are consistent with each other in international trade agreements.

Following Parliament’s vote, the Union is, at long last, going to regulate the activities of the most speculative investment funds. A long time has passed since Poul Rasmussen’s own-initiative report which, back in 2008, proposed that strict limits should be imposed on these ‘financial black holes’. It has taken the financial crisis to make the Member States and the majority of Parliament agree to adopt binding legislation on alternative funds. For the first time, these funds, whether or not they are based in Europe, will be subject to controls, restrictions on their activities and greater transparency; carving up businesses will no longer be possible, and the European Securities and Markets Authority’s supervisory powers will be extended. Much remains to be done to supervise finance effectively in Europe; ESMA, not the national authorities, should be the only authority with responsibility for this matter, and businesses should be protected even more from speculation. Had it not been for the reservations of the conservatives, the Union could have adopted more rigorous and more effective legislation. This is merely a first step. The text we have adopted will be revised in four years’ time. This will be an opportunity to go further, on the basis of an assessment, in order to protect the economy and jobs from the damage caused by speculation. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

In order to ensure the continued security of international transport, especially in the face of the risk posed by terrorism, it is vital for countries to be able to exchange information on passengers – PNR data, collected by airlines. However, it is just as vital to ensure that these provisions do not jeopardise citizens’ fundamental freedoms or result in some people being discriminated against because of their origin or religion. That is why the protection of personal data must be guaranteed better. The European Parliament has one clear demand to make before the Commission starts negotiating the methods of exchanging PNR data with the United States, Canada and Australia: the protection of personal data is too sensitive a subject for these negotiations to be conducted exclusively among Member States, behind closed doors. They must be conducted transparently, at EU level. The data transferred must be used only within a strictly defined context and must not be transferred to a third country. Many types of information will have to be excluded from the data that can be collected, in particular, that information in connection with ethnic origin and religious beliefs. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Parliament has just voted at first reading for extending maternity leave to a minimum of 20 weeks all over Europe, paid at full salary, except for high earners, and the possibility for fathers to take at least two weeks’ leave following the birth of a child. This is a victory for the proponents of a social Europe and a step towards more equality between men and women in Europe. A section of the right used the future cost of these measures as an excuse to reject this progress. Yet helping parents to reconcile family and work life will make it easier for parents to go back to work, will boost European birth rates and will safeguard the health of mothers and babies. The left of Parliament, with Portuguese Socialist rapporteur Mrs Estrela, held strong, the European right was divided and the move towards progress won the day. The battle must now be won at the Council, where several governments are threatening to block this directive. Members of national parliaments should take this up and intervene with their government so that governments do not undo what the European Parliament is proposing for a Europe that protects its citizens’ rights.

 The crisis has revealed the shortcomings of Economic and Monetary Union: it nearly brought down the euro and has resulted in the loss of millions of jobs throughout the continent. With Pervenche Berès’s report, the European Parliament has just adopted a coherent strategy proposal to lift Europe out of the recession and to address the latter’s financial, economic and social repercussions. This proposal includes the introduction of real financial supervision, which we have started to implement, but which will have to be considerably strengthened; the taxing of financial transactions in order to regulate the markets and finance public assets, and to reduce public deficits; the coordination of Member States’ economic policies and budgets for the benefit of sustainable growth; the appointment of a Mr or Mrs Euro to be in charge of the euro area and to unify its representation at the G20 and IMF; and the creation of the European Energy Community. It is now time for Europe to get going again. This is what the public expects. In a constantly changing world, inertia is tantamount to decline. That is why we now need to move on from this report and take practical action. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 The reinforcement of health care systems in sub-Saharan Africa is a crucial aspect of development policies. Compensating for the shortcomings in care systems will also have an impact on public health worldwide, through improved training for medical professionals, appropriate prevention campaigns and reduced treatment costs. This will contribute to a fall in serious epidemics, such as HIV, tuberculosis and dysentery. It is not acceptable for private companies to hinder access to health care for the sake of profits, and it is even less acceptable for conservative religious movements to reject sexual and reproductive health policies and question the right to abortion, thereby putting the health of millions of women at risk. In order to improve the health care systems in sub-Saharan Africa and throughout the world, it is essential for the European Union to be more in step with the rest of the international community. In particular, it has a role to play in encouraging the emergence of non-profit-making, solidarity-based mutual health structures, enabling the promotion of access to quality health care. This is why I support the adoption of Mrs De Keyser’s report. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Yesterday saw the opening of the United Nations summit on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. Even if progress has been achieved, we are far from the objectives set for poverty reduction between now and 2015. In order to achieve them, the first imperative is job creation in the developing countries, as, according to a recent joint report by the IMF and the ILO, there are more than 210 million unemployed in the world in 2010, as the crisis has caused the loss of 30 million jobs since 2008. The ILO is calling for employment to no longer be considered as an outcome of other policies but as a primary objective and pillar of growth strategies. Sustainable development, support for jobs and support for decent work demand support for the diversification of the economy, compliance with ILO standards, a set of social protection rights for all, investment in public services and addressing basic needs such as access to water, to health and to food security. More employment will also be a prerequisite for the stability and strengthening of democracy. That is the thrust of the Theocharous report. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, for the first time, Parliament will be called on to give its assent to a readmission agreement. This is a very important responsibility which I believe Parliament must exercise seriously, since it involves the safety of the people concerned. Pakistan is a state which has neither signed nor ratified the Geneva Refugee Convention or the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons. This agreement could affect not only Pakistani nationals but also citizens of other countries fleeing war and disturbances, and here, I am thinking, in particular, of Afghans who could well find themselves, as a result of this agreement, being sent to a state that offers no guarantees whatsoever. Therefore, Parliament’s first – and, I think, most legitimate – request is that we be given an assessment of the previous readmission agreements, since this was, after all, what the Commission promised. Secondly, we call for Pakistan to sign these Geneva Conventions before any agreement is envisaged. Thirdly – and this is the very least we expect – we ask that Parliament be able to take part in the Joint Readmission Committee; in other words, that it also is able to monitor the terms on which any future agreement is implemented. As the situation stands at the moment, I do not think we should give our assent tomorrow. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 The motion for a resolution on the situation of the Roma people is a major snub for Mr Sarkozy and a scathing call to order from the European Parliament. The stigmatisation of the Roma by the President during a speech on insecurity, the statements by his Minister for Home Affairs against the Romanians and the blatant expulsion of several hundred of them in breach of the law are an insult not only to the values of the French Republic but also to the fundamental values of the Union. Throughout history the Roma have been systematically marginalised, discriminated against and used as scapegoats. Regardless of whether they are French, Romanian or Bulgarian, today they are European citizens. The indignity of the treatment they have received should not be tolerated in a community founded on the principles of law, freedom, equality and non-discrimination, which lie at the heart of the EU Treaty and its Charter of Fundamental Rights. The resolution is therefore a firm and unambiguous condemnation of the French Government’s actions and of the discriminatory rhetoric that accompanied them. It condemns expulsions in breach of the law. It demands that the governments of Europe and the Commission coordinate their actions to integrate the Roma, using the funds allocated by Parliament.

Today, more than 20% of young people in Europe are unemployed, and many others are in casual jobs without social protection. The increase in the number of training courses casualises active young people and is a vector for social dumping affecting other employees, in that it puts pressure on companies to lower salaries and replaces normal jobs. The Turunen report asks the Commission and the Member States to organise their activities so that young people’s access to high quality training courses and jobs becomes a priority, and in order to guarantee them a decent income. It is unacceptable that some Member States are planning a lower minimum wage for young people. In this report, Parliament also calls for the introduction of a ‘European guarantee for youth’, which would give each young person in the EU the right to be offered a job, an apprenticeship, a supplementary training course or a job combined with a training course if that young person has been unemployed for four months. It also calls for the development of a ‘European Quality Charter on Traineeships’, which would include norms on time limits, minimum allowances and course-related social security benefits.

Achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 is a fundamental commitment by the international community. However, it has not provided itself with the resources to fulfil that commitment. Two-thirds of the way through, it is clear that many least developed countries (LDCs) will be unable to achieve any of the goals of eradicating poverty, of providing access to education and health care, and that most developing countries will be far from achieving them too. Europe is the world’s leading donor but, with 0.4% of GNI, it cannot be content with falling so far short of the target of devoting 0.56% to official development assistance (ODA) in 2010, a target that it set itself. The fact is, the aid requirements are greater than ever, especially in the areas of food security, the fight against climate change, education, health – in particular for HIV sufferers – and maternal and reproductive health. With the Cashman report, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is calling for the European Council of 17 June to endorse the proposal for a 0.05% tax on international financial transactions, which would yield EUR 10 billion, and to set itself the target of achieving 0.63% of European GNI in 2012, with a view to increasing it to 0.7%.

Developing countries, in particular, the poorest ones already hard hit by the 2007 food crisis, are today suffering the full force of the economic and social consequences of the international financial crisis that began in the developed countries. The latter are now inclined to reduce their development aid to face up to their own difficulties. Developing countries are thus paying twice for the mess caused by unregulated global capitalism. I voted for the Guerrero Salom report, which reminds Europe of its responsibilities and demands respect for the commitments made in relation to official development assistance, in particular, the goal of contributing 0.7% of GDP to this by 2015. By adopting it, Parliament is also calling for the implementation of an international levy on financial transactions to fund development, access to Global Public Goods and the adaptation of poor countries to the challenges of climate change. It supports cancelling the debt of the least developed countries. All of these recommendations are essential as we approach the review of the Millennium Development Goals at the United Nations in September. The European Union has a moral duty to implement these new tools of international solidarity without delay. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

The 2020 strategy is supposed to replace the Lisbon Strategy. It is, above all, in danger of prolonging the shortcomings, of ending in the same lack of results and of causing the same disappointment. It is neither a true recovery strategy nor a new perspective for the economic, social, budgetary and fiscal policies of the Union. The myriad good intentions are matched only by the absence of new instruments with which to implement them. Europe needs a different ambition; the citizens expect more convincing responses. Since the start of the crisis, the unemployment rate has increased by seven million. The banks are speculating again, hedge funds have not been regulated, the citizens are being asked to tighten their belts, drastic cuts are being made in public services and social protection is being cut back. The Greek crisis serves to reveal our lack of solidarity. That is why Europe must debate a different view of its future, one that is based on true economic coordination, a recovery characterised by solidarity, a green growth strategy, an energy community, a cohesion budget, own resources, investment in education, research, fiscal and social harmonisation, the fight against tax havens and the taxation of international financial transactions.

In 2000, I tabled with the Globalisation Intergroup the first resolution calling for the Commission to examine the feasibility of a tax on speculative capital flows. The resolution was not adopted, since it was just short of the number of votes required. Ten years have passed, the G20, like several Member States, is no longer ruling out the idea of such a tax, and above all, the financial crisis has served to remind us of the damage that volatile financial markets can cause. That is why I welcome the adoption by a wide margin of the resolution on taxes on financial transactions. This is only a small step, but the message is clear. Parliament is calling on the Commission to finally take up the issue and to work on an implementation project. A tax such as this would have the twin advantage of helping to stabilise the markets and of generating huge revenues to help developing countries finance their adaptation to climate change and the fight against poverty. Objectors tell us that it will only be effective if it is global, but make a start we must, as some countries have done with the tax on flight tickets. A wait­and­see policy will get us nowhere.

The current generalised system of preferences (GSP) will soon be coming to an end. I voted in favour of the resolution, a specific aim of which is to involve Parliament fully in its revision by 2012. This trade regime enables 176 developing countries and regions to benefit from preferential access to the European market in exchange for their ratification of ILO conventions on social rights and of UN conventions on human rights. Its implementation is unsatisfactory, however. That is why we demand, before the revision, a report on the current state of ratification, implementation of the conventions, an impact assessment of the effects of the GSP during the period 2006­2009, the inclusion of a condition stipulating that 27 fundamental UN conventions must be implemented, and more transparent investigation processes – involving, in particular, regular consultation of Parliament. It is regrettable that, during this vote, an amendment calling for an investigation procedure to be carried out in Colombia concerning the numerous killings of trade unionists and the mass graves containing the bodies of hundreds of people killed in the region of La Macarena was not passed because of opposition from the right.

 Mr President, Commissioner, this agreement with Korea will be the first to truly implement the Global Europe strategy as an important agreement, and it ought therefore to be particularly exemplary because it will set a precedent. However, we note that, firstly, there is a problem concerning the information given to Parliament, particularly with regard to the safeguard clauses, then a problem concerning the method used, since we have already been told that it might be possible to implement temporary provisions or temporarily to implement the agreement without even waiting for Parliament’s assent, and finally, a problem concerning the clarity and transparency of the trade framework – this was raised by Mr Rinaldi – since, through the duty drawback, we could in fact have an agreement indirectly concluded with China. I believe we must be particularly clear about these free trade agreements. In addition, there is a consistency problem with regard to the aim of developing social and environmental standards. When it comes to compliance with social standards, we are, for example, a very long way from what the United States has negotiated in its agreement with Korea.

Mr President, Commissioner, you have stated your hope that Tunisia will make progress in the areas of democratic reform and freedom of expression. You are right to do so, since this is quite simply in line with the association agreement and with the commitments that Tunisia has made to the European Union. That is why I am very surprised by the comments made by both Mr Baudis and Mr Michel, which seem to be encouraging you to ignore this aspect of our relationship and our cooperation with Tunisia, and to ultimately abandon Article 2 of the association agreement. Moreover, there is a long way to go before these commitments are honoured, judging from the fate – as already mentioned by my colleague, Mrs Guillaume – of the independent journalist Taoufik Ben Brik, who has been in prison since last October, following a trial in which his lawyers and the procedure were in complete violation of the law. In addition to the unacceptable denial of his freedom, his health is deteriorating and his visiting rights have been restricted. I therefore ask you, Commissioner: does the Commission intend to intervene within the framework of the Association Council to demand Mr Ben Brik’s immediate release and to ensure that his situation and his state of health may be taken into account, at the very least on humanitarian grounds?

 Thank you, Minister, for your reply. I congratulate you on your initiative to hold this conference in Palma de Mallorca in March, as it will follow on from the conference held in Stockholm. The problem is that we have to contend with multinational companies; as you said, Europe has to take the lead in corporate social responsibility, but it also has to take the lead as regards the conduct of European companies located outside Europe. The problem is that these subsidiaries are separate legal entities. Are you prepared to envisage a legal instrument by which parent companies would be obliged to assume responsibility for the conduct of their subsidiaries located in other parts of the world when they fail to meet their obligations in relation to the environment or to respect for human or workers’ rights? Because, if this obligation is not imposed, European companies will slip through the net of this corporate social responsibility that Europe wishes to promote due to the conduct of their subsidiaries located elsewhere in the world.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate Mrs Joly on her work, on the report and also on taking into account the contributions of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, and, although we have again tabled some amendments, we see our contribution in the resolution that she has presented. For our group, the partnership between the European Union and the ACP countries is part of an historic commitment, which must retain all its specific characteristics, which must not be watered down, even by the need to comply with certain rules, such as those of the WTO. We are most concerned that this partnership should preserve, in particular, the consistency of all European Union policies – trade policy, budgetary policy – with objectives in the area of development, but also in relation to the promotion of peace, security and democracy and human rights in ACP countries. It is not a question of imposing a model, but of working with these countries to ensure their development, which must be sustainable development. From this point of view, it is very important for this revision to enable us to take into account new elements of the last five years: the fight against climate change, technology transfers, renewable energy development aid, the fight against food crises, and therefore greater emphasis in our cooperation on agriculture, on food sovereignty, the fight against financial deregulation, good fiscal governance and the fight against tax havens. We see our contribution in all of that. I would like to stress two points. Trade: with the implementation of the Economic Partnership Agreements, certain provisions of the Cotonou Agreement will become obsolete, but we are concerned that this agreement should still mention that the trade clauses and the trade regimes from which the ACP countries benefit must not be less favourable than those from which they benefited previously. It seems to us that we should integrate the GSP, the interim EPAs and all these provisions in the revision of the Cotonou Agreement. Finally, on emigration – our colleagues in the group will emphasise this – we are concerned that it should actually be said that the migration agreements preserve the rights of migrants and that we cannot accept transit regimes to countries that do not guarantee respect for human rights.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Doha talks were opened in 2001 to correct the imbalances, in fact the injustices, of the international trade system that was introduced following the Uruguay Round, when the WTO was created. It was thus acknowledged that the Uruguay Round had not kept all the promises it had made concerning developing countries, and that the countries of the South were at an unfair disadvantage where trade rules were concerned, particularly in the field of agriculture, because these trade rules allow the richest countries both to protect their market and to continue to fund their production, including that intended for export, bankrupting many farmers of the South in the process. Cotton has come to symbolise this situation. In opening the ‘development round’, the WTO members have therefore committed themselves to amending multilateral trade rules in order to ensure that trade really does benefit economic and social development in every country, on every continent. Thus we should always remember that this round of negotiations is not a round like any other, and that, even if, as in all negotiations, everyone is waiting for progress to be made on the issues that concern them – for industrialised countries, that means industrial products and services – it was agreed, from the outset, that this round was, first and foremost, about restoring the balance in favour of developing countries. Today, in the wake of the Seventh Ministerial Conference, as before it, negotiations have essentially stalled on the slopes of Capitol Hill in Washington, just as they sank, in the past, in the sands of Cancún, and, back then, this was largely due to the demands made by the European Union. Having demanded too much during the negotiations, industrialised countries have thus jeopardised the final outcome of the round of negotiations and the credibility even of the WTO. Everyone is focusing solely on personal goals instead of on the overall goal, which is to create a multilateral trade framework that is based on fairer rules to encourage fairer trade, and which promotes sustainable development and the eradication of poverty. The first outcome of this stalemate is the increase in bilateral trade agreements, which are often even more unfavourable to the countries of the South. This is a step backwards. The European Union must therefore adopt a clear position. The priority is to conclude this round as a development round and not to try to outdo one another where industrial products and services are concerned. These negotiations must not be approached in a conventional and narrow-minded manner, where everyone is simply out for themselves. This leads to a deadlock and makes one lose sight of the main issue: the need to create a new way of regulating the international trade system that will form part of the new global governance that everyone has called for, particularly since the G20, in order to address the real challenges of today, which are fair development on all continents, the eradication of poverty, food security, respect for social rights and decent work, and the fight against climate change. During these negotiations, the European Union must show what it is doing to ensure that trade rules will help improve this situation in the future. It is on this basis that each of the following points of discussion must be considered: – on agriculture: honouring the July 2008 commitments; concluding the negotiations on procedures; guaranteeing, in particular, special and differential treatment, respect for special products, and safeguard mechanisms; developing agricultural support in accordance with sustainable agriculture and food security; – on NAMA products: asking developing countries for tariff reductions – I am finishing here – that are in line with their level of development; and – on services: protecting the right of every country to continue to regulate its public services.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 28 September, the people of Guinea took to the streets to appeal for the commitments that had been made to be honoured, and for free and democratic elections to be held, as promised. They have suffered the worst possible repression by a regime that was already devoid of all legitimacy and which, that day, lost all dignity. Men were repressed, women were disembowelled with bayonets, and raped, and the political opponents and trade unionists were tortured and maimed. The European Union must today support the African Union, ECOWAS and the United Nations in refusing to allow this crime to go unpunished and, above all, in showing solidarity towards the Guinean population. This country, which has an abundance of assets, will never be able to use them for its development as long as corrupt dictatorships can seize them for the benefit of a clan. That is why I welcome the firm approach announced by the European Commission, one which our Parliament is able to demonstrate today. We cannot weigh strict economic interests against the commitments that were made by the European Union’s partners, particularly those who signed the Cotonou Agreement, concerning respect for human rights and respect for democratic principles. Today we have a commitment to the people of Guinea: to support them in their fight for freedom and democracy. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation between Europe and the United States is crucial in resolving most of the major crises in the world, and the new US administration certainly provides an opportunity. It has already taken some initiatives that have marked a break with the past: in Iraq, on Guantánamo, on the anti-missile shield. It would be naïve, however, to think that that will be enough to make US and European points of view identical in all situations, and that transatlantic relations will now be very simple. Whether on preparations for Copenhagen or aid to developing countries, on Doha and protectionism, on financial regulation and combating tax havens, on the relaunch of the peace process in the Middle East or a firm policy on the nuclear issue in Iran, the US is extremely unwilling to take action. This goes beyond the issue of whether or not the administration has good intentions, and often relates to the influence of lobby groups on Congress, or simply the defence of its interests by a great power which is being shaken by the new world order. All these spheres will only make progress if Europe plays its proper political role as a separate global player, in a partnership of equals – to use the Commissioner's expression – and fully assumes its responsibilities. From this viewpoint, I must say that there is a certain confusion in the European attitude and sometimes even a certain naivety, and that this also extends to Parliament. The approach being taken to the idea of a large transatlantic market, which was Sir Leon Brittan’s hare-brained scheme back when he was Commissioner, poses certain risks. This affair of barriers to trade is being tackled as if the problems were only of a technical nature. Naturally, economic and commercial trade between the United States and Europe is important for jobs and for businesses. It ought to be developed. First of all, however, trade is not really in danger. Secondly, when there is a conflict, either it relates to defending our economic interests – for example, as in Airbus – or it poses a risk to our health or environmental rules – in the case of beef containing hormones, for instance, or chlorinated chicken – and we should therefore not prioritise the improvement of economic relations over our own internal model, our social model, our environmental model, or development model, as if economic relations were an end in themselves. We must be able to combine the two, and we should not surrender our political autonomy in search of a partnership that is, in itself, a commendable objective. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two Member States – France and the United Kingdom – have announced their intention to send to Afghanistan refugees who came to Europe in an attempt to save their own lives. I do not believe that we can continue to stand back in the face of this very serious threat to their lives. The British newspaper, The Guardian
, reported in October that some Afghan refugees expelled from Australia had been killed upon their arrival in their country. I believe that all of this goes completely against all of our international commitments. The European Commission itself said in an action plan dated June 2008 that legitimate measures to reduce illegal immigration should not result in refugees being denied access to protection within the European Union, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has warned the European Union against making any attempt to undermine the Geneva Convention and the other additional forms of protection that are designed to ensure that Afghan refugees are not deported to Afghanistan. A large number of MEPs, from four different groups, have signed an appeal along these lines. I call on you, Mr President, to talk to the European Commission, the United Kingdom and France, and our House, our Chamber, must take up this issue in order to prevent this crime against the right of asylum from being committed.

 Madam President, the excellent report by Mr Lange has three positive features. Firstly, it proposes an integrated industrial strategy for the European Union; that is to say, a strategy at once continental and cooperative, which differs in all respects from the narrowly national and non-cooperative policies in operation in Europe for the last 15 years. Secondly, this industrial strategy is financed, which is in marked contrast to the 2000 Lisbon strategy. If it were not financed, it would remain empty words. The main source of this funding is EU project bonds, Eurobonds and euro projects. In voting this morning, we faced up to that. Thirdly, this strategy protects our industries. This report is for opening up Europe; it is against giving it away. It is for exchanges founded on reciprocity and balance. Several articles focus on these issues. This is absolutely crucial because, in this area, we appear naive and weak. Henri Weber  (S&amp;D

Madam President, for such an important debate, I would have liked Baroness Ashton to have been present or at least one Member of the Council. Good for China! It has decided to lead the way in green technology; 38% of its massive recovery plan has been invested into these new industries. It is already the number one producer and biggest exporter of solar panels and wind turbines in the world. We would be only too delighted with this new direction, which can help reduce pollution levels in China and world-wide, were production to be carried out in accordance with WTO rules. However, that is not the case. Chinese exporting companies receive massive aid from state banks and local authorities. Although some green technology markets are open to foreign companies and foreign investment, many remain restricted in terms of quotas and some are even closed. Our European industries are under threat in the light of such unfair competition. Commissioner, China has signed WTO agreements. The European Union must ensure that it adheres strictly to the rules.

Mr President, the European Union has many tools to make it a global leader in the manufacture of clean cars and, in particular, of electric cars. The Commission must ensure that this project is a major European objective by encouraging the large car companies on our continent to cooperate with one another, with such cooperation extending from research and development to marketing. It must encourage the widespread installation of accessible and interoperable charging points in Europe, starting with urban areas. It must draft and enforce common rules and standards – if possible, at international level, but certainly at European level – and it must do so without delay. Lastly, it must encourage the Member States to gradually replace their fleet of combustion vehicles with electric cars. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the ban on removing the fins of sharks on board vessels. This practice has been prohibited in the EU since 2003, but some shipowners benefiting from exemptions in Spain and Portugal are suspected of ‘finning’, which involves cutting off a shark’s fin and throwing its flesh back into the water. The report therefore plans to force all fishermen to wait until their vessels have landed before cutting off sharks’ fins. This debate is a perfect illustration of the need to establish a real European fisheries control policy. The practice of ‘finning’ is unacceptable, but there is no proof that it takes place in Europe. However, in view of the doubt, it was necessary to remove any possibility of the continuation of such practices. Since controls have failed, the European Parliament has been forced to eliminate all exemptions, which will not be without consequences for professionals. The challenge now is to ensure that the issue of European fisheries control is dealt with more effectively. In particular, uniformity of controls must be promoted and the resources allocated to this vital tool for our fisheries policy must be increased. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 As shadow rapporteur for this report, I was involved in defining artisanal fishing. This term features repeatedly in texts on the common fisheries policy reform, without appearing to fit the definition established by the Commission. Indeed, the latter admits to having opted for a simplistic definition – currently, all vessels measuring 12 metres or less. However, this fails completely to take account of the diverse nature of European fishing. Given that small operators have more difficulty in gaining access to European funding, a new definition may be required to ensure fairer distribution of this funding. To that end, classification as a micro-, small or medium-sized enterprise and the skipper-on-board requirement appear to be more appropriate criteria. Even if Parliament has not come up with a final definition of artisanal fishing, this report should be welcomed for anticipating the discussions on the financing of fisheries and for wisely acknowledging that there is not one single criterion but a whole range of criteria for defining artisanal fishing.

 I voted in favour of the Lövin report, an own-initiative response to the Commission communication on the external dimension of the common fisheries policy. In the context of a CFP reform in which European fishing rules are becoming ever stricter, this report seeks to promote a sustainable fisheries policy beyond the EU’s borders, so as to protect European fisheries from unfair competition, by proposing that fishery products imported into the European Union should be subject to standards aligned with our own as regards environmental and social sustainability. Fish have no concept of borders. The European Union’s efforts to exploit fish stocks sustainably will be in vain, therefore, if we do not make sure to apply these requirements worldwide. By tackling the issue of the common fisheries policy reform in a global context, this report serves, in its own way, to foreshadow part of the substance of the future CFP. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, the debates on fisheries at this part-session each herald, in their own way, part of the structure of the future common fisheries policy. As architects of this policy, we must always bear in mind that each pillar of sustainable development affects the balance and solidity of that structure. In other words, the fisheries policy must at the same time be economically viable, safeguard jobs and preserve resources. These five reports put the main objectives of the future CAP to the test: maximum sustainable yield, reducing rejects and allocating fishing rights. These objectives cannot be mere slogans, however. Consequently, the technical measures in the Gallagher report, despite being only transitional, highlight the difficulties involved in moving to practical cases, fishery by fishery, stock by stock. The Ferreira report on artisanal fishing rightly recognises that there is not one criterion, but a range of criteria, for defining artisanal fishing. The Gróbarczyk report highlights the lack of data. The Lövin report on the external dimension points out that we are evolving in a global context and looks at the conditions for the exploitation of resources outside European waters as well as the import conditions to ensure fair trade. We cannot allow the restrictions imposed on our fishermen to continue without balancing them with import restrictions to prevent unfair competition. Finally, the Patrão Neves report on sharks emphasises, in particular, the urgent need for stronger EU controls. The success of an ambition cannot just be declared: it requires patient, meticulous work between goals and resources. That is what we are trying to do. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report on protecting children in the digital world. The digital world is a great tool for communication, information and education. However, children today are accessing this world at an increasingly young age. Parents are not always able to protect them in this enlightening but complex universe, where there are dangers such as commercial targeting, sexual abuse, bullying on social networks, etc. I supported this report because it will allow greater coordination of actions at European level. Education about digital media, tackling illegal content and content harmful to minors, protection of privacy and the right of reply will help to protect children. This report has successfully brought together two important principles: protecting children and defending freedoms. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 The Erasmus programme has proved its worth by enabling millions of young people to go and study in another country, improve their qualifications, learn a foreign language and discover another culture. The scheme contributes to European integration but also to the personal integration of young Europeans. Anything that came in its way would be a step backwards at a time when citizens are having their doubts about the EU and our young people are having doubts about the future. The programme is now a victim of the short-term vision of some Member States that, in the name of defending liberal dogma, are endangering one of the EU’s tools for investing in the future, that of training and that of youth. Discussions on the 2012 and 2013 budgets are well on the way to overcoming this deadlock, but this should not be disconnected from the negotiations under way on the financial framework for 2014-2020. The proposal of a freeze on the EU’s budget is unacceptable when we are promoting education and qualifications as the main assets in the fight against unemployment, particularly of young people. On the contrary, a substantial increase in the EU budget is necessary to get through the crisis and prepare for the future. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

I voted for the report on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources, a report voted on unanimously in plenary, which was a historic moment! The report itself presented no problems. The access regime to the current zone of 12 nautical miles, which is managed and controlled by the Member States, is one of the CFP measures introduced in 2002 that has been the most widely supported by stakeholders, and the effectiveness of which is undisputed. The report voted on in plenary only had the effect of extending the time limit of the regime until 31 December 2014, after which it was expected to be brought into line with the CFP reform currently under way by means of a new regulation. The vote was unanimous because certain questions raised by the committee were not addressed, such as the proposal to extend the derogation in coastal zones beyond the current limit. In order to avoid any further extension, the rapporteur also proposed that the regime should be extended indefinitely. These questions will of course be discussed in more detail when the future regulation is adopted, which is expected to cover a period of 10 years. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to support Peugeot employees. Almost EUR 12 million will be released for the 2 089 workers who were made redundant by Peugeot. These funds will be used to finance active reintegration measures additional to those required by virtue of French law and to help the workers to find new jobs. However, I regret that this support for Peugeot employees is one of the EGF’s last on the basis of the ‘crisis’ criterion and that access to the Fund will be restricted in the future. At a time when the recession and unemployment explosion are hitting European countries, the Council has unfortunately decided that this ‘crisis’ criterion may no longer be invoked to mobilise the EGF.

 I voted for the report on the minimum level of training for seafarers. The European Parliament had limited room for manoeuvre, since the Member States had already accepted the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW). These changes constitute progress on training and the harmonisation of the issue of certificates of competency. They also improve the prevention of fraudulent practices and the standards applied in respect of fitness to work, medical requirements and requirements concerning alcohol abuse. In a sector which operates without borders, it is in the interests of seafarers, as well as in the general interest, for the certificates issued by Member States and third countries to be recognised everywhere in Europe. However, to avoid a ‘race to the bottom’, it is necessary to ensure that a certain number of strict common criteria remain in place. We can be satisfied that this is the case. I also welcome the Commission’s initiative of obliging Member States to communicate the available information on certificates, an appropriate provision which will help establish an overall picture of the current state of affairs and a strategy for employment in the sector.

 I voted in favour of the report on measures taken for the purpose of the conservation of fish stocks in relation to countries allowing non-sustainable fishing. The content of this report is crucial, as it seeks to ensure fair competition between European fishermen and third countries. Faced with an ambitious European legislation to protect fish stocks, we must be given a guarantee that our fishing activity is not relocatable at lower environmental costs. This report mentions the option to restrict imports of fishery products originating from countries allowing non-sustainable fishing, to restrict the provision of port services to vessels flying the flag of those countries or to prevent Union fishing vessels from fishing the stock of common interest under the responsibility of the country allowing non-sustainable fishing. However, I note with regret that the report is entirely conditional, so I hope the European Commission will be quick to make a legally binding proposal on this matter. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted for the report on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products, although it would have been a better idea to put it to the vote after the adoption of the basic Regulation on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The progress achieved by the vote is patchy. On the negative side: this report provides for a market of landed by-catch, and yet this landing has not yet been agreed in the basic regulation. It is, however, necessary to have at our disposal a legal framework, without pre-empting any means which will be implemented to limit, or even eliminate, by-catches. I was, on the other hand, very much in favour of Parliament recognising the need to put European funding for the storage mechanism on a sustainable basis and agreeing to create an eco-label. Producer organisations have also been given greater power and recognition, and can, in particular, become transnational. Finally, the report supports the development of aquaculture, a development that I support providing that we bear in mind that this activity is complementary to fishing and must be set within a framework of strict environmental standards, without promoting the creation of a fish meal market.

 I voted in favour of the report on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources. This own-initiative report is satisfactory because it has allowed us to move the debate on the common fisheries policy (CFP) forward, particularly by highlighting the consensus in Parliament on the need to improve data collection, an essential prerequisite if we are to arrive at a sound definition of the CFP’s objectives at a time when the status of some fish stocks is still unknown. However, it is only one vote in the process. This report also points out the need to go in the direction of greater decentralisation, at a time, in particular, when the Commission has stated that there are too many ships in the European fleet compared with available fish stocks. Yet it does not study the realities of each coastline and the different fish stocks found there. The report also notes that one of the prime priorities of the CFP should be jobs, because without fish, there is no fishing, and without fishermen, neither is there any fishing. Finally, Parliament has noted that transferable fishing concessions should be an optional management measure, and recognised that the obligation to land by-catch should be adjusted to the realities of each fishery.

 I voted in favour of the overarching communication on the common fisheries policy (CFP). This non-binding report is acceptable insofar as its content anticipates and influences forthcoming debates on the basic CFP Regulation. It has enabled us to make some progress on the Commission’s proposals, which is important for future negotiations, and which, I hope, will allow for further improvements. In the face of the EU’s very controversial proposal to introduce transferable fishing concessions, a tool for liberalising the fishing industry, Parliament spoke in particular in favour of a voluntary system, allowing Member States to decide whether to implement it or not, which is an encouraging start. Parliament also noted that we should reach the maximum sustainable yield by 2020, and not exceed it, a notion thought to be too vague. The proposal to land all by-catches, which the industry has great difficulty in implementing because of technical constraints, has also been watered down, in favour of a gradual implementation on a case-by-case basis, depending on the characteristics and realities of the different fisheries. There should be further discussion about the technical feasibility of implementing such a measure. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report on the sulphur content of marine fuels. With this directive, the EU is making provision for a reduction in the sulphur content of ship emissions to 0.1% by 2015 in the Baltic Sea, the English Channel and the North Sea. It therefore transposes into EU law an obligation required by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), which was difficult to ignore. The 2015 deadline, however, seems very premature given the economic and technical constraints that it will impose, especially on passenger shipping. The fear is that some ships will have to be withdrawn from the fleets, as there will be no way of adapting them to the new requirements, leading to the loss of hundreds of jobs in an economic context where passenger transport companies are facing difficulties. Negotiations in Parliament have, however, allowed us to confirm that State aid would be authorised to support the operators in this transition. There is also a reminder that Member States can still approach the IMO for an extension to deadlines to allow their fleets to be fitted out within the deadlines. These different safeguard measures have led me to approve the transposition of the European Union’s international obligations in this directive. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report on Education, Training and Europe 2020. Education and training are crucial elements in achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and ensuring the future growth of Europe. The current economic difficulties must not be used as an excuse to reduce the resources set aside for education and training. In order to guarantee the investments for the future, the Socialists proposed excluding investments in education and training from the national deficit calculation of the fiscal compact. As the report points out, dropping out of school early has a higher cost than the crisis. There is thus no point in making short-term savings that would compromise future growth. For the same reasons, we encourage the Member States to devote at least 2% of their GDP to higher education in order to ensure a knowledge-based economy. However, additional efforts are required in the area of early childhood education and schooling, which is a crucial stage in the development of our future workers and citizens.

 We are preparing to vote on a number of texts that will define the future of European fishing. These texts affect hundreds of thousands of jobs, our food autonomy, the preservation of fish resources and the durability of an economic sector. Despite the fact that these major issues are evidently of general interest, the Commission has given its draft reform a very liberal slant. Parliament’s work has, of course, toned down these proposals. It is just a first step, however. Future work must go beyond declarations of intent. From now on, we have to build real tools to achieve an economic, social and environmental balance for this activity, in accordance with the EU’s 2020 strategy. It is just as essential to preserve jobs as it is to preserve resources. We urgently need to establish homogeneous controls throughout the Union. Similarly, we can no longer use different methods to collect scientific data. The renewal of the fleet is essential for the emergence of a future fishing sector that is more selective, safer, cleaner, and more efficient and thus more profitable. Otherwise, we will be left with one question: is the fisheries policy an exception to the 2020 strategy? Kader Arif,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we have just heard, the question of public procurement reform is a fundamental one for Europe, particularly at this time of crisis. European rules are generally focused on the criterion of price, which means that our businesses are helpless in the face of foreign operators that do not hesitate to practise social and economic dumping in order to win public procurement contracts in Europe. That is why it is essential to recognise additional criteria, including in the WTO agreement on government procurement. In the debate that I led in the Committee on International Trade, I stressed the need to reform that agreement and to extend it to new countries, particularly emerging ones. However, the creation of new instruments is also urgently required. In particular, we need an effective and binding tool for establishing a greater degree of reciprocity with countries that do not offer equivalent access to European operators. Since the Commissioner has brought it up, I should also like to receive more details about the legislative proposal that is being drafted. Lastly, we need to create an instrument for supervising buyouts of European businesses by foreign capital, in particular, by sovereign funds. This is a solution that has already been applied by the United States through an ad hoc
 committee and which ensures the protection of this strategic sector. Europe, which can be naive or weak when faced with its foreign competitors, would be well advised to take inspiration from it. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, aside from the work which Mr Caspary has done, I find that the new trade strategy proposed by the Commission does not address the challenges which Europe has to face in light of the financial, economic, social, environmental and food crises we are experiencing, nor does it address the expectations of our fellow citizens who are calling for stronger regulation and for a new sustainable growth and development model for the planet. Unfortunately, however, this does not or no longer comes as a surprise. Faced with these calls for new regulation and new solidarity, the Union must establish a new doctrine for an alternative trade policy. If Europe does not advocate a fairer form of trade that is founded on the values of justice and that generates quality employment in both Europe and the rest of the world, who will? Solely promoting services is not a policy. We need to preserve strong industrial and agricultural sectors through an employment-generating industrial policy and an updated CAP. The inclusion in all of our free trade agreements of social and environmental standards, and stringent human rights rules which guarantee decent working conditions, is fundamental. Europe must lead the way in balancing trade openness with room for public intervention and the legitimate protection of various economic sectors both in Europe and in its partner countries – a fair trade policy for fair trade should be the aim.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ever since the United Nations General Assembly agreed to create two states on the territory that formerly constituted the Palestine Mandate in 1947, we have never stopped waiting for that commitment to be realised. So how can we now accept the caution expressed in the speeches? In the light of this historic opportunity, how can we justify refusing to back President Abbas’s request fully? Let me remind you, Baroness Ashton, that sometimes caution can result in cowardice. I would therefore like to pay tribute to the courage and perseverance of one man, Mahmoud Abbas. He is the bearer of a legitimate hope, that of a people who have a right to a land. For those who object to the fact that this initiative could provoke an outbreak of violence, let me remind you that a few years ago, the suppression of a similar initiative fostered the Second Intifada. My message is simple, Baroness Ashton: at the time of the Arab Spring, it is your duty and ours to support the Palestinian request to the hilt. The European Union boasts of having brought down a wall and of recognising states. It will be able to stand even prouder if it recognises that the Palestinians are also entitled to statehood.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am even wearing a flower-patterned shirt to symbolise the Arab Spring. Who could have expected, a few months ago, this wind of change energised by the universal values of democracy and which is now blowing on the southern shores of the Mediterranean and more widely on the Arab world? No one. Certainly not most European leaders who have been urging us for years to enter into agreements of all kinds with dictatorial regimes for the sake of Europe’s interests. Today, I say to myself that it is never too late to show courage and dignity – the courage to say to our people that there is no Muslim horde about to sweep across Europe, but that there is a young population who, paying with their blood, want to see democracy irreversibly established, and want Europe to be a partner who helps them, so that the rule of law is no longer an illusion but becomes a reality. Tunisia and Egypt are currently in a situation of emergency. There is not enough time here for me to give an overview of the countries where there are uprisings. However, I do want to vigorously condemn with all my heart, here before you, the atrocities committed by the Gaddafi regime in Libya and the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. Naturally, this condemnation is directed at all countries where the word ‘repression’ is opposed to the word ‘freedom’. In moments like these, even if history is sometimes cruel, the international community – of which you are one of the dignitaries, Madam – should react so as to show support to and solidarity with the peoples who have taken up the struggle, but also to condemn in the strongest possible way, and in all instances, all these contemptible regimes and all the countries that do not comply with international law or with United Nations resolutions. In your communication of 25 May, you mentioned this support. I know that this is one of your priorities. However, I urge you, Baroness Ashton, even if this means devoting all your energy, to move from appeasing words to constructive solutions. I would not wish to see, as the only response to this Arab Spring which is changing the face of the world, a European winter where narrow-mindedness sets in, borders close and walls come up.

 I voted against the resolution tabled by the European right, as it promotes an ultraliberal vision of the EU’s trade relations with India. The right systematically opposed the amendments that I tabled on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament in order to rule out any liberalisation of public services, strongly condemn child labour, request legally binding clauses on corporate social responsibility and demand respect for the principle of equal pay for equal work with regard to Indians who will come and work in Europe in the future. The compromise was impossible, the differences of opinion obvious and irreconcilable. Only the resolution tabled by my group, together with those by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, offered a progressive vision of EU-India trade relations. Unsurprisingly, it could not hold out against the right-wing majority in Parliament, which is a shame. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 In anticipation of the EU-Japan Summit at the end of the month, Parliament has adopted this resolution stating its views on trade relations between the two partners. Unlike the European right, which spoke out very strongly in favour of opening negotiations on the conclusion of a free trade agreement, I defended a more cautious approach. Japan is a trade power that needs to be approached with caution when it comes to trade liberalisation. That is why my group opposed the present text presented by the European right and stressed the need to launch specific impact studies assessing the consequences of stronger trade relations for all the sectors concerned (in particular, the automotive sector) and for employment in Europe, before we open any negotiations. At the same time, we emphasised the problem of non-tariff barriers, which prevent European businesses from accessing Japanese public contracts. Indeed, it is wrong that the European Union, the region in the world that is most open to foreign investment, cannot operate on the markets of its industrialised partners under fair conditions.

 In the wake of the floods that devastated Pakistan in 2010, the Council called for emergency measures to support the country. I tabled an amendment rejecting the regulation proposed by the Commission, as trade preferences of this nature are a good idea in theory but not in practice. Our response to a humanitarian crisis cannot be based on trade, especially considering that it is now one year on from the disaster and the urgency is not as strong. This type of support is illogical and prejudicial, as some people in Europe, in particular those working in the textiles industry in several of the southern countries, will end up paying for support for Pakistan that we should all be paying for collectively. Furthermore, by only targeting certain industries, we are not helping all Pakistanis. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Since the Treaty of Lisbon, investment has been an area of exclusive EU competence. Parliament therefore initially gave its verdict on the shape of the future European investment policy. This is the report I myself drafted, which was voted on during the last part-session in April 2011. In Mr Schlyter’s report, Parliament has now examined transitional arrangements for managing investment agreements that Member States have already concluded with third countries. As in the vote in committee, I advocated a Community vision and stated that agreements that were already standing should be closely examined by the Commission in order to check their compatibility with the Treaties and with Union law and Union policy, in particular the objectives of the Union’s external action on sustainable development. However, the vision that has prevailed in the end is a right-wing vision in which protection of private investors is given priority over these objectives based on the general interest. Unfortunately the negotiations that will now be entered into with the Council are not likely to correct our aim, in an EU in which the good of the Union as a whole is rarely able to withstand national egotism. Kader Arif,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by sincerely thanking all those with whom I have had the opportunity to work on this issue. All the contributions have helped in the drafting of this report and, thanks to the cooperation of all the political groups, and I am especially grateful to the shadow rapporteurs, we have on the table today a consistent text that sends out a powerful message. Indeed, we are at a turning point in European investment policy and at a time when we have to seize the new power conferred on us by the Treaty of Lisbon in order to meet a dual challenge. Firstly, that of providing European businesses with the tools they need for high quality foreign investment that is protected by a legal framework providing long-term support. Secondly, Europe must strengthen its position as the world’s leading beneficiary of foreign direct investment and give itself the means to control that investment so as to encourage sustainable development that creates high quality employment. By voting on this report, the first official expression of our institution since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, Parliament is fully assuming its role as a new colegislator in trade regulatory matters and is voicing its priorities at a time when the first investment protection negotiations are about to begin. This expression is essential, because it is intended to relay the concerns of the citizens, who are showing a growing interest in trade matters and whom we must support. In a world, today, where conflicts also take place in a trade context, protecting those businesses of ours that invest abroad must become a priority. International agreements have been created to protect investors from harsh, unjustified expropriations and hidden laws aimed simply at eliminating them from this or that market. This primary objective must be maintained. Although Europe is one of the most open markets in the world, a balance must be restored with our main partners so that European businesses can benefit from a level playing field. This is the proposal made in this report, which stresses the need for future agreements to include standards relating to non-discrimination, fair and equitable treatment, and protection against direct and indirect expropriation. However, those standards must be defined in such a way as to prevent any misinterpretation. Some businesses have, in fact, used the vague wording in first-generation investment agreements to protect their interests beyond what is legitimate, for example, by attacking new social and environmental laws that harm their interests. Appearing before international arbitrators and with no transparency or possibility of appeal, they have demanded considerable compensation by claiming that those laws are on a par with indirect expropriation. Europe, which, in the future, will receive ever more investment, particularly from emerging countries, must guard against such abuses. That is the idea behind the reforms undertaken by the United States and Canada, two countries whose governments and authorities have suffered several setbacks in international arbitration cases and which have radically overhauled their investment agreement model. By proposing new definitions of protection standards, the report strikes a fair balance between the protection of investors’ rights and the right of public authorities to regulate. This also means including in all future agreements specific clauses laying down the possibility for public authorities to legislate and regulate in the areas of national security, the environment, public health, workers’ and consumers’ rights, industrial policy and cultural diversity. Lastly, increased protection for investors must be accompanied by more responsible behaviour, particularly in developing countries, where the social and environmental laws are less binding. That is why the report mentions that social and environmental clauses should be included in all free trade agreements signed by the Union. Furthermore, we must go beyond naming and shaming and include in all future agreements a set of clear corporate social responsibility rules with which businesses must comply and which are based on guidelines set by the OECD. If our aim here really is to shape the contours of a new European investment policy, then I call in this report for it to be exemplary and to promote investment which is sustainable, respects the environment and encourages good quality working conditions in Europe and in third countries alike. That is why this report, by the power vested in it by Wednesday’s vote, must serve as a reference for all future negotiations conducted by the Commission. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first allow to me to express the regret that it took a crisis in Europe to trigger the debate we are having today and the motion for a resolution we will vote on tomorrow. Just last year, when the developing countries rose up in what was called the ‘food riots’, Europe simply proposed emergency response measures, that is, to send seedlings and fertilisers, as though the problem were cyclical, when we have long been warning of structural problems. We have a common agricultural policy (CAP) that lacks effective regulatory mechanisms because the liberal majority still believes that nothing must restrict the market. There is widespread, economically destabilising and morally unacceptable speculation on agricultural products of developing countries that are prisoners of single-crop farming for export, with a Europe that does not support them and allocates only 4% of its development aid to the agricultural sector. With this resolution, Parliament as a whole finally acknowledges that the right to food is a basic human right, that it is unacceptable that the hunger of some is exploited for the benefit of others, that regulation is indispensable in ensuring price stability, and that trade agreements must preserve small family farms and the right to food. Today, Parliament is delivering a clear message. It is up to the Commission and the Council to translate it. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, it can never be said often enough that what is happening in the southern Mediterranean and, more generally, in the Arab world, is historic, especially for those peoples who, half a century after their countries gained independence through decolonisation, are today gaining their individual and collective freedoms. It is historic, but also unexpected, as are all popular revolutions, I hear you say. However, this new situation requires us to totally rethink our vision, our policies and our relationships with these countries. Proposals have been made. Indeed, the caution with which we have reacted to date is easily and worryingly explained by our obsession with stability, by which I mean that safety-first approach fuelled by our fears, an approach of which the sole priorities were the fight against immigration, terrorism and radical Islam, along with some economic interests, not least access to energy. We accepted authoritarian regimes, when their sole aim was to confirm our fears. The people’s revolt has made the failure of our policies plain to see; we no longer have the right to go on basing our analyses on the same fears, or, worse still, the same xenophobia-tinged beliefs. That is why we must stand side by side with those who aspire to greater freedom and democracy, in places where it is possible to be Muslim, democratic and secular. That is the message that we are being sent. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, until now I had suspected that peoples were always ahead of their political elites. Today I am quite sure of this. May I first of all pay tribute to the courage and determination of the Tunisian and Egyptian peoples. They have reminded us that the values that we stand for in the world – human rights and democracy – are not values exclusive to the West, as some proclaim, but rather are universal values shared by all. Europe, in my view, can no longer continue to make mistakes in this part of the world, shilly-shallying as it does from wrong analyses to misguided projects. These peoples are expecting a response from us that is equal to their courage and aspirations. They are not asking for charity but they are certainly asking for solidarity, and even more so for responsibility. In these uncertain times, nobody wants chaos, but nobody should have to accept the status quo any longer, either. We must support the hope created by the events in Tunisia and Egypt in order to help affirm and establish democracies that will benefit these countries and their populations, but which will also benefit us, and I believe that you have expressed this forcefully, Baroness Ashton. I shall conclude by quoting what a poet once said: ‘The world sleeps from a lack of imprudence.’ These peoples, quite rightly, have been imprudent in calling for their freedom, but I hope above all that they will have awakened our consciences.

 Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the elections in Côte d'Ivoire have just taken place. The international community tolerated their being postponed year after year by the regime of Laurent Gbagbo. These successive reports alerted a number of us to the difficulties in which we find ourselves at the moment but, deep within ourselves, we hoped that the democratic spirit would prevail in a country that has suffered a great deal from sterile and unacceptable confrontations focused, in particular, around the concept of Ivorian nationality. The international community and, in particular, the European Union around Baroness Ashton and through my fellow Member, Mr Preda, mobilized to ensure that these elections took place under the best possible conditions, transparently and without violence. This should be commended. In view of the calm that prevailed and the atmosphere of mutual respect among candidates, the electoral campaign gave us cause to hope that the result would be accepted by all the parties. Today, unfortunately, the democratic result that emerged through the ballot box has been rejected by the outgoing President. Tomorrow, like my fellow Members, I will therefore vote in favour of appealing to Mr Gbagbo to accept that what appears to him to be a reversal of fortune or a conspiracy is, in fact, simply the will of the majority of his citizens. He cannot hang on to power without calling into question part of his own militant history, which was to appear, when resident in Europe, as the man who had brought about the newly regained freedom and democracy established in his country. The United Nations representative in Côte d'Ivoire courageously assumed his role and announced the results of the ballot. As First Vice-President of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I would also like to point out that a declaration was adopted by our Assembly on 3 December in Kinshasa firmly condemning the decision of the Ivorian Constitutional Council for invalidating the results. This declaration comes on top of the clear and unambiguous position taken by the leaders of the Member States of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and of the African Union. Today, the regime of Mr Gbagbo is neither wanted by its citizens, nor supported by its neighbours, nor accepted by the international community. It is therefore time that he accepted the victory of Alassane Ouattara, the democratically elected President of Côte d'Ivoire, who must be in a position to take on the responsibility entrusted to him by his people as soon as possible. Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to conclude by asking the European Union to assume its role through the means at its disposal to persuade Laurent Gbagbo and his illegitimate government to accept that the game is over. We will not allow his obstinacy to lead to chaos in Côte d'Ivoire. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the title of this debate is likely to create a certain optimism because in theory, it is about defining the procedures for helping banana-producing ACP countries. The reality is entirely different, and I have to say that the way they have been treated throughout this report is quite simply unacceptable. We must first and foremost bear in mind the fact that the banana sector is vital for many African and Caribbean countries. Yet, despite this, they have made the effort to accept, at the WTO, an agreement which lowers the European customs tariff to EUR 114 per tonne, in order to put an end to a long-standing dispute with Latin American producer countries. However, the Commission seems to have forgotten to inform them of the bilateral negotiations under way with these same countries on a far lower tariff: EUR 75 per tonne. In other words, the commercial consequences of these agreements will be deeply felt in a context in which the lion’s share of the European banana market is already held by multinationals based in Latin America. Faced with this situation, during the last plenary session of the ACP-EU Assembly in Tenerife, all the members agreed to adopt as one a declaration calling for support measures tailored to producers’ needs to be implemented without delay. Back in Brussels and Strasbourg, I see that, unfortunately – and this is no surprise – the right is backtracking and even opposing any reference to this declaration. I am tired of this double-dealing, but, above all, I fear that this weariness is shared by our historical partners, who no longer believe in our will to truly support their development. Kader Arif,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am always very happy to speak after Mr Fjellner, as I am always sure that I will not be in agreement with him. First, I should like to thank our rapporteur as well as all the shadow rapporteurs and, in particular, my friend Mr Susta, for their excellent work and their good cooperation on this text, which will finally enable a system of compulsory marking of origin on certain products imported into Europe to be introduced. I should like to thank you too, Commissioner, for your commitment. Our vote tomorrow will, in fact, be the first stage in the introduction of this regulation, which dates from 2005, and which the European Parliament has always supported and called for. Origin marking is an important step towards transparency and information, which we must constantly improve in favour of European citizens. Indeed, European consumers rightly want to know what they are purchasing, where the product comes from and under what conditions it was produced. They are therefore demanding to be able to consume in a more informed and, hence, responsible way. With this new regulation, we are responding to this demand, because our citizens will be better informed, in particular, of the social and environmental conditions under which the goods they purchase are produced. Contrary to what some people want to believe, the consumer is also a citizen, who agrees to pay more for quality European production, because this legislation is also essential for European companies, whose production is associated with a reputation for quality and high production standards. For those companies that have chosen to maintain production safeguarding know-how and employment in Europe, this regulation will re-establish a level playing field with our third-country trading partners. The text resulting from the vote of the Committee on International Trade is balanced, which is why, when it is voted on in tomorrow’s plenary, I call on the Members of this House not to call this balance into question and to support this text by voting overwhelmingly in favour of it. Kader Arif,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are clearly faced with a text whose complexity troubles many of us and, even more, in my opinion, the citizens of Europe. Commissioner, I asked for transparency and you responded. Today, I am somewhat concerned. Indeed, as I see it, beyond the purely technical issues, the main risk is that of the direction we are beginning to take with regard to this increasingly complex relationship between individual freedoms and the Internet. The world is changing rapidly, and we are all aware of this. We are all aware of the revolution taking place in access not only to information but also to culture via this tool. In today’s world, where such access is immediate and free, traditional reference points are being undermined. Our most complex task is, therefore, to define new regulations, because regulation is necessary not only to protect artists and rights holders; but I do not want to see individual freedoms ignored. As regards the protection of freedoms, one of the most important of which is the protection of the right to privacy, one of my main concerns is the possibility afforded by the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) of travellers’ personal effects and baggage being checked at borders. Does this mean that our mobile telephones, our MP3 players and our computers may be searched by customs authorities looking for illegally downloaded files? According to the Commission, this is just a possibility, because the precise term used in the text is not binding. It is said that the Member States may choose whether or not to allow their personal luggage to be searched. However, let us get serious here for a minute. How can one expect such wording not to be seen as incitement to carry out such checks? Do you really think that a government, especially if it is pressurised to some extent by its music industry – and I cite this example deliberately – will not take this opportunity afforded by ACTA to move its national legislation towards increased screening of passengers entering its territory? Another problem is that, if it is proved that the files held by a private individual are for commercial use, punishment is automatic. However, who determines whether the files we hold are of a commercial nature or not? Some may say that a person with 500 songs on his or her MP3 player necessarily has commercial objectives, but why would others deny themselves the opportunity to fix this limit at 300, 100, 50 or 10? In fact, for an ill-intentioned person, all it takes is to illegally download a single film in order to make thousands of copies of it, and that then becomes commercial activity. Finally, punishment will be meted out by the courts of each country, but a European citizen arrested by the border authorities of a signatory country on the basis of particularly binding legislation will have no means of challenging it. Is it your wish that such an abuse be possible? Was it not the responsibility of the Commission precisely to do everything it could to ensure that the agreement prohibits searches of personal effects? I have deliberately raised only this issue this evening, but you have raised many more, which we will incorporate into the resolution I have requested and which will ordinarily be voted on in next month’s plenary. Commissioner, I would ask you to take account of the outcome of this vote, which will be in line with our commitment, that is, to take account of the word of the European Parliament before you sign the act. Kader Arif,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

Mr President, Commissioner, here we are, finally, after many months of work, aiming to lay the foundations for the European Union’s future External Action Service but, like some of my fellow Members before me, I should like to thank the rapporteurs for the quality of their work. Since our shared vision is to see a real European diplomatic service which is not just an extension of the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States, the Financial Regulation and Staff Regulations, which we will discuss today and vote on tomorrow, are of paramount importance. They must give us the means to face a dual challenge: speaking with one voice on the international stage, but also guaranteeing consistency in all the Union’s external policies. With this in mind, trade policy does not fall within the High Representative’s mandate, but as a former trade commissioner, I have no doubt that she can establish the dialogue which is needed to ensure that trade policy, as specified in the treaty, observes the goals of the Union’s External Action Service, in particular, sustainable development, eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights. Lastly, I should like to stress that our shared political will will be measured by the budgetary resources earmarked; our ability to have political punch on the international stage depends on it.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, and as has just been pointed out, the Treaty of Lisbon strengthens Parliament’s powers. However, few of us are aware of the radical change that it brings about, particularly in the field of trade policy, which I follow closely. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament will ratify all international trade agreements. This is already causing quite a stir, and the discussions on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and on the free trade agreement with Korea are merely a first sign of this. However, the socialists and democrats in the Committee on Trade wanted to go further than the treaty allows. I am their spokesperson, and despite the scepticism of some and the opposition shown by certain others, I conveyed a clear message: if Parliament is to ratify any trade agreement, it must be involved from the start of the process. What used to seem idealistic is now a core element of our relations with the Commission, since we will be fully consulted on the negotiating mandates. I welcome this. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to continue to respect the Community spirit and the democratic will that are at the heart of the treaty. I also call on my fellow Members – since we suffer from a kind of Stockholm syndrome where the Commission and the Council are concerned – to use all our rights, because they are the rights of our fellow citizens. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, please allow me to make a general remark about this report which, in my opinion, is a reflection of our relationship with Turkey. Although I must congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their work, what I mean to say is that it is ambiguous. It reflects our indecision with regard to that country. As, one by one, the amendments were adopted, or otherwise, within the Committee on International Trade, an underlying – almost subliminal – issue, but one which was largely outside the scope of economic and commercial relations with Turkey, kept emerging: are we for or against that country’s accession to the EU? They reflect a kind of hesitation, which has not been taken on board: should Turkey be regarded as just another third country with which commercial relations might well be developed, or as an accession candidate, which thus imposes particular obligations which must be fulfilled by both parties? It is indeed difficult to say today whether this report accurately reflects the reality of our relations with that country, and especially whether it actually defines an EU strategy in this regard. It depends on which side of the fence we stand: do we simply want a privileged partnership, or do we want Turkey to actually accede? I should simply like to warn against the contradictory signals we are sending out. We cannot maintain an ambiguous approach with regard to our common destiny while, at the same time, worrying that Turkey seems to be distancing itself from the EU. A partnership requires frankness but it also requires trust. It requires frankness, because Turkey does, in fact, still need to make a great deal of effort to ensure root and branch reform and fulfil its undertakings. However, it also requires trust, which itself requires us to provide encouragement and send out positive signals. When the Turks voted to reform their constitution a few days ago, they also did what the EU is asking of them: they are gradually bringing their legislation into conformity with our standards so that they can become a fully fledged Member State. There is still a long way to go and a great deal of effort to be made, but let us refrain from creating additional obstacles and diverting our relationship from its aim, which is membership. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I can still only see good things emerging from a reform such as this, which is always highly complex. The signal indicating that the army is less powerful and that democracy is moving forward is, for me, an important signal sent out to the EU. One can always criticise and believe that certain things have not been done, but a step forward is still a step forward. I am not a pessimist by nature, and I think that all the actions taken by Turkey are along the right lines and that it is expressing a desire to accede. Let us therefore try to support it.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you have just said some reassuring things, but I still do not think that the concerns shared by a large number of Members about the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) have been completely dispelled. Back in March, I proposed a resolution, which was passed by a large majority in this Chamber, and which made it possible to publish the negotiating text. During the debate, we called for the acquis communautaire
 – which you have referred to – the safety and supply of generic medicines to be guaranteed and the fundamental freedoms of our fellow citizens to be respected. We also referred to geographical indications, and we did so in order to tell you our priorities, which I am going to keep on repeating to you so that the position which you will defend in a few weeks’ time in Japan is based on the parliamentary debate which we have managed to initiate. Yesterday, during the debate on the State of the Union, many speakers quite rightly pointed out that we MEPs are the spokespeople for our fellow citizens and that, without this link, the Commission is in danger of engaging in a sterile confrontation with Parliament. I am therefore asking you, Commissioner, to consider, as a priority, that the MEPs before you are first and foremost your partners and are not here to simply contradict you. The partnership we want is not one in which we are bound, as your services sometimes seem to want, by a vow of secrecy. Your services have just answered our questions behind closed doors. We are given the latest version of the ACTA text but we are prohibited from sending any messages when we leave these meetings or after we have read the agreement, whereas our role is to alert, explain and ensure things are understood. This is therefore my second request for you to regard the transparency of debates as an element which enriches your deliberations rather than as a breakdown of trust. In addition to these two main issues, and because I am starting to become accustomed to this type of exercise, I am going to inform you of my concerns. First of all, there is access to medicines. This has been mentioned. You tell us that protecting access is one of your priorities, that you are doing everything possible to ensure that nothing in this agreement hinders their manufacture or free movement. At this point, however, I would ask you about patents. Why do you want to include them in this agreement? The desire to step up the legitimate fight against counterfeiting should not be a pretext for using ACTA as a means of extending the rights of patentees way beyond what is set out in the TRIPS agreement. Please do not confuse generic medicines with counterfeit medicines. Another important point is safeguards. Texts cannot be too rigorous in ensuring a true balance between the rights of users and those of rights holders. I refer you to the various formulations contained in the TRIPS agreement. I welcome your comments about the Internet and I have great confidence in the idea that ACTA will not serve to weaken the EU position clearly expressed in the E-Commerce Directive. Commissioner, there are definitely other issues I should raise this morning, but the first duty I am setting myself is to ensure that, thanks to this debate, we are able to provide as much information as possible on this agreement to all our fellow citizens, and to tell you that the key element for me is the protection of their rights and their fundamental freedoms. This is why I expect you to bear in mind the points raised by Members and to defend them during the negotiations. I also call on you to honour your commitment to publish the text as soon as the negotiations have been completed, whether this is at the end of the round in Japan or at a subsequent stage. The public debate will have to take place, for example, in this Chamber. I shall therefore ask for a resolution, and we expect you to take our point of view into account before any signing of ACTA takes place, even if this means returning to the negotiating table.

 I voted today in favour of this resolution because it strongly condemns Israel’s attack on the humanitarian flotilla bound for Gaza, and demands that an international and impartial inquiry be carried out in order to shed all possible light on this deadly assault. This is a firm stance that demonstrates our common desire to see justice served, and I welcome that. For too long, Europe has been an economic giant, the leading provider of development aid to the region, but a political dwarf, incapable of having a decisive influence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict so as to enable a peaceful solution to be found. Today, thanks to the perseverance of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, this House is expressing its clear, strong position in favour of the immediate lifting of the Gaza blockade, which has resulted in a genuine humanitarian disaster. Europe must face up to its responsibilities. It has a duty to play a decisive political role in order to finally achieve concrete results in view of the creation of a viable Palestinian state.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial, economic and social crisis that we are going through is unprecedented. It is hitting our continent and its peoples hard, it is causing huge social and human difficulties, and Greece, unfortunately, is a harsh and shameful example of this for us. Unemployment is constantly rising. Already, millions of Europeans are jobless, and the figure is rising from one day to the next. The response must be political, strong, swift and coordinated, and it must take into account the serious environmental crisis that we are going through, which requires a new development model. These many crises give rise, among our fellow citizens, to a great deal of expectation and to a hope to which the Europe 2020 strategy should have responded. However, in the face of these challenges on an exceptional scale, the response has not materialised, and I regret that. The guidelines laid down in March by the European Council are not up to the task. There is no determination, no ambition, but, unfortunately, that does not surprise me any more. Everywhere, you Members of the Council and of the Commission, you and your Commissioners boast about the consistency of your policies. However, I have the impression that this is just an umbrella concept to disguise your lack of action. You do not have a consistent strategy combining economic, social, trade, industrial, agricultural or research policies to guarantee sustainable and fair development. Moreover, the external dimension of European trade-related action is nowhere to be found or is under the auspices of the untouchable liberal ‘global Europe’ dogma. We want trade to be a proper instrument that helps to create jobs and growth, to combat poverty and to promote development. However, you are pursuing – not for technical reasons, but for political reasons – a different objective: you are racing to reduce costs and to cut wages, you are racing to conclude bilateral free trade agreements to the detriment of multilateralism, thereby causing social and fiscal dumping. That policy is responsible for too many job losses, too many relocations and too much social damage to carry on as it is. To conclude, we expect the Commission and the Council to rekindle the European spirit, and to reject national self-interest so as to make Europe a haven not just of prosperity, but of solidarity too. Ensuring that Europe projects a different image of itself not only to its own citizens, but also to the rest of the world: that is what the resolution by the Group of the Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is all about. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

The resolution on ACTA, which has been adopted today and of which I am one of the initiators, is extremely symbolic because it is unanimous. It is a clear signal sent out to the Commission, which has been negotiating this agreement in the utmost secrecy for two years. Parliament demands complete transparency with regard to the negotiations under way, as well as respect for the treaties, which entitle it to receive the same information as the Council. Whether in terms of the method or in terms of what we know of the substance, I am opposed to the way in which the ACTA negotiations are being conducted. We have many fears with regard to the calling into question of the acquis communautaire
. Aside from the risk of reintroducing the ‘flexible’ response, respect for the fundamental rights of citizens, in terms of freedom of expression and of protection of privacy and of data, and the principle of non­liability of Internet access providers and hosts could be called into question. Parliament has already proved its commitment to these principles, and if the Commission does not change its strategy, I will lead the campaign against the ratification of ACTA by Parliament, as we have already been able to do for the SWIFT Agreement.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is currently experiencing an unprecedented crisis which, beyond the economic and financial crisis, represents first and foremost a crisis of the system. Even before beginning to deal with the effects of the economic crisis on world trade, which forms the topic of our debate, I wish to clarify one point: trade is not a victim of the crisis; it is also one of its contributing factors. Indeed, we are currently experiencing a period of huge global imbalances, fuelled, on the one hand, by certain countries’ excessive trade deficits at the cost of growing domestic indebtedness and, on the other, by trade surpluses stimulated by the exports of certain, especially emerging, countries with internal consumption that is not growing at the same rate. Moreover, the trade liberalisation policy conducted thus far has only exacerbated these imbalances, weakening, in particular, the poorest countries on the planet. These countries, which have been encouraged to specialise in export monocultures, have therefore found themselves destitute in the face of extreme fluctuations in the prices of raw materials, the volatility of which has increased as a result of international speculation. It is a strange world that sets as its first Millennium Development Goal the eradication of poverty and hunger but then, at the same time, speculates on the rise in wheat prices. However, the very people who defended liberalisation and deregulation at any cost in the 1990s are now finding themselves in a difficult situation as well. The continual rise in job losses, stagnant, sometimes even negative, growth, and the developing social crisis are all factors that mean we can no longer afford to let jobs disappear in the name of this cult. In a period of crisis, how do we explain to employees who are losing their jobs that the main thing is to maintain deregulated trade, even at the cost of sudden and sometimes tragic relocations? The crisis we are going through is therefore definitely a systemic crisis, to which we must respond with a new development model. In its current Global Europe strategy, the vision developed by the Commission is essentially based on access to the market and the liberalisation of all sectors. Commissioner, I believe we need to redefine this strategy, which has been on the wrong track and sometimes led to setbacks. It is not by forcing developing countries to open up even more that we will revive our industries’ exports. That would only aggravate the situation in those countries, which already accommodate 70% of the 59 million people in the world who lost their jobs in 2009. On the contrary, it is essential to consider a new strategy that strikes the right balance between openness, protection and support. I would like to return to these ideas. We cannot ignore these developments, which lead the United States to make further use of its trade defence tool or China to take issue with the WTO over European anti-dumping measures. Indeed, when we are faced with unfair practices, it is clear that protection is necessary, but the principle of it must be accepted and defended internationally and the sometimes false accusations of protectionism dismissed once and for all. Moreover, the need for support for trade policies is becoming more obvious every day, and such support depends, in particular, on the policies implemented by the Union being genuinely consistent. Consistency in policies is not an intellectual debate, but an absolute necessity if we want to redefine a new development model. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in September, we were already debating in plenary the free trade agreement between the European Union and Korea. There were already many of us who expressed our fears about the negative consequences of this agreement, especially with regard to the automobile sector. We did not think that events would prove us right so quickly. On 21 January, Opel announced the closure of its Anvers site, the production activities of which will be relocated to South Korea. Are we to believe that this decision has nothing to do with the free trade agreement that has just been negotiated? Allow me to spot a connection there. During this period of economic crisis in which the workers are the first to pay for the mistakes of the financiers, the Commission is duty-bound to consider, now more than ever, the job-related consequences of the agreements that it negotiates. It is no longer possible to give a simplistic response to these employees, for whom we know full well it will be very difficult to find another job. We cannot say to them that international trade is a game of winners and losers and that, unfortunately, they are the ones who will be sacrificed and that we can do nothing about it. We expect answers from you today, Commissioner. First of all, we want to know whether your Directorate-General has assessed the impact of this agreement on jobs in Europe, for I must tell you that the figure greedily announced, that is, the EUR 19 billion profit that European exporters are expected to make, does not convince us. Where does this figure come from? On what study is it based? Leaving aside the expected positive effects, however, have the negative effects also been taken into account? The Commission has drafted a regulation on the methods for implementing safeguard measures within the context of this agreement. These methods relate, in particular, to duty drawback, an advantage that has never before been conceded, not even to our developing trade partners. The proposals put forward provide for complicated procedures for invoking and enforcing the safeguard clauses. Nevertheless I feel reassured because, for the first time ever, Parliament will soon be able to express an opinion on this text under the ordinary legislative procedure. I would, however, like to point out that Europe’s employment problem will not be solved by palliative measures taken on a case-by-case basis. That is why I, together with my whole group, am calling for a real European industrial policy, one that represents a genuine strategy for the future of our industries, to be drawn up at last. In a context of economic crisis and of intensified global competition, this industrial policy must be coordinated effectively with the common trade policy so that our free trade agreements do not lead to job cuts in Europe. A second matter on which we expect clarification is that of the protocol on cultural cooperation included in the agreement. Several Member States have reacted very harshly to the negotiations initiated with Korea, a country that has failed to ratify the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. I condemn the very principle of initiating negotiations on this topic, and I believe that cultural issues should be handled separately from trade negotiations and placed in the hands of the Commissioner for Culture so as to prevent this matter from becoming a negotiating item under the same heading as conventional goods or services. To conclude, Commissioner, you know how essential it is for MEPs to be kept fully informed of the negotiations under way and to be involved at all stages, including from the point at which the negotiating mandate is defined. Leaving aside our differences in approach, I would like to point out that better upstream consultation of Parliament would have made it easier for us to understand the strategy being pursued. I therefore trust I can count on your support and on that of your Commission to assist us in our future work, with everyone acting within the scope of his responsibilities, but always for the benefit of a trade policy that is obviously more European in scope, but that is, above all, fairer.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, trade policy is going to be a major factor in the Union’s external policy. Unfortunately, this trade policy is today the symbol of the disappearance of Community interest, since it is nothing other than the addition of national interests. At a time when we want Europe to defend its values – solidarity, social justice – when we want Europe to be able to integrate into its trade agreements social rights, environmental rights, the protection of human rights and the protection of trade union rights, we realise that the Commission’s only proposal to us is to conclude agreements in which it is felt that there is no alternative to the market and trade and that they are an end in themselves. This, as far as my political family is concerned, is unacceptable. At a time when we want this trade policy to be able to integrate industrial policy and the effects that it may have on employment policies, we realise that the Commission has given no guarantees on these points in the comments made this morning by the President of the Commission. Unfortunately, however, this does not surprise me. Nothing has been said about the horizontal social clause, about the protection of public services, about the way to see Europe change policy again or have a totally different policy. To conclude my remarks on these issues, Mr Barroso, I believe that trust is built within a two-way relationship. With your comments this morning, you have not offered us what we need to put our trust in you. Please note that, since you have not provided these guarantees, I cannot guarantee that we will put our trust in you. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Zapatero, Mr Buzek, ladies and gentlemen, in this period of crisis, trade policy occupies an ever more important place in public debate, as Europeans are increasingly finding that the trade strategy introduced at Union level has a direct impact on growth and employment. Against a background of increased international competition, the race for reduced costs has led to too many job losses or relocations. In the face of this situation, our group considers that trade must be a tool to serve objectives such as job creation, the reduction of inequalities and sustainable development. During his hearing, the Commissioner for Trade, Mr De Gucht, appeared to agree that trade could not be an end in itself. I should therefore like to know if, in the course of your Presidency, you will support a reform of European trade policy to ensure that it creates more jobs and is linked more closely to a true industrial policy. Will you also take action to support fair trade at world level, fair trade that is capable of promoting development, decent work and respect for human rights? In other words, will you introduce binding social and environmental standards into our agreements? Kader Arif,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we have an opportunity today to talk about the anti-homosexual draft legislation submitted to the Ugandan Parliament on 25 September. At a time when we are seeing an increasing number of human rights violations, I feel it is crucial, in the light of this anti-freedom law, for the European Parliament to look beyond the divisions that separate its political families and be able to condemn this bill in the strongest possible terms and to call on the Ugandan Parliament to reject the bill and to review its national legislation in order to decriminalise homosexuality. As Mr Cashman pointed out just now, every single NGO has spoken out against this bill, regarding it, moreover, as a serious obstacle to the fight against AIDS. The Commission, through Commissioner De Gucht, and a large majority of the Member States – adding their voice to the statements made by President Obama – have already condemned this initiative. I therefore call on the Commission to rethink our involvement with Uganda if this bill is adopted. A country that, at that point, would be in violation not only of international law but also of the fundamental principles of the Cotonou agreements could not continue to benefit from the support of the European Union. To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to point out that everyone must have the right to freedom of sexual orientation, without fear of imprisonment or death. This principle is not open to debate. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Doha Round was clear. It was supposed to be a round to promote development, a round allowing developing countries to correct the imbalances created by the liberal policies implemented to date within the framework of the notorious Washington Consensus. It is not surprising – although I deplore the fact – that during this crisis period, positions favouring equitable trade are on the retreat. In the face of the United States, which will not move until the health reform has been passed, and in the context of growing opposition from trade unions and the main industrial lobby groups, Europe is not managing to shift the boundaries, and it is therefore unlikely that an agreement will be reached soon. The majority within this Parliament is therefore taking advantage of the fact to return to its ideology, that of aggressive trade, based solely on the interests of gaining greater market access. Blame the crisis. In acting in this way, in seeking, above all, the opening up of the markets and the removal of all barriers to trade, those on the right wing are, in addition, completely forgetting that it is in our interests to have strong trade partners that are fully integrated into the system of world trade. The reality is that no developing country could end up strengthened by such an agreement. Together with Mr Désir, our group’s rapporteur on this resolution, we have tabled several amendments to the joint compromise text produced by the right-wing European political parties. Of course, I would like to see my own group’s resolution adopted, but this will not happen. That is why our amendments make several points. Firstly, it is absolutely vital that public services remain outside the framework of the negotiations, because they relate to people’s fundamental needs and cannot be left to the markets. Next, special treatment should be given to products which are sensitive for developing countries, particularly in the agricultural sphere. The food crisis has been swept out of people’s minds by the arrival of the financial and economic crisis. Let us not forget that food sovereignty should be our absolute priority, the first of the Millennium Development Goals. Finally, we believe that the public intervention area in developing countries should be maintained, not only by ruling out any liberalisation of public contracts, but also by protecting new industries. These few points, which are not an exhaustive list, are the absolute minimum in order to ensure that the Doha Round will truly promote development. If they do not appear in the final text, I will call upon my group to vote against it. (Applause) Kader Arif,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Moreira for his speech. On 9 December, the Euro-Mediterranean trade ministers will meet to debate the revival of our economic and trade cooperation. Firstly, I would like us all to be clear about something: if the aim of the free trade area was indeed to benefit all of the partners, from the North and from the South, setting 2010 as the date on which it will be introduced was neither realistic nor even desirable, given that there are still huge disparities in development terms between the north and the south sides of the Mediterranean. Moreover, some people are still advocating the fact that, to make progress with the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership – which I would remind you is made up of three pillars: politics, economics, and society and culture – we simply need to brush aside the political difficulties in order to make headway with the economic and trade aspect. As you will have gathered, I do not believe in this magical and pernicious view that trade alone can help us progress towards harmonious integration, peace and stability. I believe in it even less since the facts speak for themselves. For example, the Union for the Mediterranean, in brushing aside the political conflicts, was supposed to revive stagnant Euro-Mediterranean cooperation with so-called concrete and visible projects. Today, it is the Union for the Mediterranean that is stagnating, and the political disputes that have gone unmentioned have come back to haunt it. I am among those who are fiercely attached to the spirit of the Barcelona Process, who believe that progress is not measured solely by trade statistics, which are, incidentally, still too unfavourable to our partners from the South, to their populations. Trade for trade’s sake – no, I definitely do not believe in it. On the other hand, trade that is focused on development and aimed at reducing the gap between rich and poor, at ensuring that prosperity really is shared and that regional integration exists – yes, I can conceive of that. However, the negotiations still need to be steered in this direction. That is why, at this next meeting, I ask that we all be ambitious, that we not just discuss technical matters to do with the removal of barriers to trade, as though that were the aim. It is unacceptable to go on thinking that way. Regional integration, particularly in terms of the South-South network, the solutions to be adopted for the economic crisis – which is having a severe impact with its associated job losses – human, social and environmental considerations, and the human rights issue must sustain the discussions and become our main concerns once again. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I had not anticipated having to respond to Mrs Dodds but I would just like to tell her that she should read the Treaty of Lisbon because, if there is one committee that will be strengthened by the Treaty of Lisbon, it is the Committee on International Trade. Therefore I can say that, when that time comes, the European Parliament will have slightly more influence in the months or years ahead. Mr Moreira put some very precise questions to the commissioner. I heard Mr Tajani answer: Libya and Syria. There was one issue that was, all the same, disposed of very quickly, and that was the whole human rights issue, on which there has been no precise response. I very much want there to be progress in the negotiations with Libya and Syria but, at the same time, precise answers must be given to the EU’s questions, enquiries and requests regarding human rights. My second point is that I feel it is impossible to talk about the Euro-Mediterranean area without raising the Israel-Palestine issue, when we see products being imported today from the occupied territories. I would therefore also like to know where the Commission stands on this issue. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not our first debate on origin marking but, as I am sure that repetition has its benefits, I will take the liberty of joining my fellow Members in stressing the need for European legislation on ‘made in’ origin marking. Indeed, in spite of the opinion expressed by this House in 2005, then in 2007, via the vote on the resolution by our colleague, Mr Barón Crespo, the lack of a majority within the Council has always prevented the adoption of this regulation. However, a text such as this would represent a crucial advance, not only for European consumers, but also for our industries. Indeed, by indicating the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries, consumers would be fully informed of the characteristics of the product they are buying. In such sensitive sectors as clothing, leather goods and furniture, creating the conditions for consumers to make an informed choice is a major issue for those companies that have taken the decision to maintain production in Europe, preserving European knowledge and European jobs. I therefore welcome the proposal that you have just made, Commissioner, but I am anxious to stress that this proposal must remain ambitious. Seeking the support of a majority of Member States must not be done at the expense of our ultimate goal. For example, it would be unacceptable for origin marking to concern only finished products, thus making it possible to import all the components separately, to assemble them in Europe and to describe them as being ‘made in Europe’. Moreover, I would like to support the Commission’s efforts to derive maximum benefit from such an agreement. Therefore, without coming back to a repeated request to improve and to simply the rules of origin, the possibility of creating a pan-Euro-Mediterranean mark would be a significant advance in terms of strengthening sectors built around the Mediterranean and South-South trade. Lastly, I should like to stress that, as part of the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Committee on International Trade will see its powers substantially increased. The Commission will therefore be able to count – I assure you, Commissioner – on the full commitment of MEPs to monitor closely the discussions on this crucial regulation for European consumers and workers. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis that we are going through is profound and long lasting. It is therefore urgent and absolutely essential to put in place the necessary regulations and supervision of the financial sector and the banks, to prevent an even more drastic repeat of today’s crisis. The financial system must once again serve the real economy and not continue to destroy it. From this point of view, the last G20 Summit in London, which has been mentioned, ended in what were, to say the least, partial proposals, but, above all, the words have not been turned into deeds, and the financial drift is there once again. In view of this situation, and so that the Pittsburgh G20 Summit really is useful, the European Union must defend strong regulatory measures that have real consequences. Beyond the essential measures to supervise finance listed by a number of my fellow Members, I personally would like to raise the issues of trade and development, because in Pittsburgh there will also be talk of relaunching the Doha Round. Relaunch it, yes, but with the condition that the initial and central objective of this Round, that is to say development, is not sidelined again. Our southern partners, quite rightly, will not accept that their concerns continue to remain unanswered. The issue at stake in this G20 goes beyond that of the financial crisis: it is about laying the foundations of new global governance. Kader Arif,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to hear a conservative and a liberal fellow Member agree with the Commission; it makes my job as a socialist easier. I hope, in any case, that this evening’s debate will make it possible at last to address the many concerns regarding the impact of this free trade agreement between the European Union and Korea and, in particular, on European industry. You spoke of a consensus but, Commissioner, I would remind you that, for some months now, certain industrial sectors – including car manufacturers and workers’ unions, which support them – have been warning you of the possible tragic consequences of this agreement. Today, the bulk of these issues have still not been addressed. It may be the case, however, that you have chosen to sacrifice the European car industry for the benefit of services. Indeed, why allow Korea to have duty drawback, which is a benefit that has never been granted before, not even to developing countries such as the countries of the Mediterranean? What is the logic behind flexible rules of origin, the impact of which is to be feared, not only for the car industry, but also for the European textile industry? Why allow such distortions of competition and, above all, why set this precedent? In the face of these risks, and, unfortunately, of others, which I cannot expand on here but the details of which you know – you have just mentioned them – the Commission has proposed a last resort, the inclusion of a safeguard clause. However, you know, Commissioner, that the safeguard clause is not automatic and that it will be very difficult to implement and impossible to activate for five years. I will cite just one example to illustrate our fears. If the free trade agreement allows Korea to export 100 000 additional vehicles to Europe – it already exports 600 000 of them annually – 6 000 jobs will be lost. Conversely, Europe is terribly restricted, with each manufacturer being able to export just 1 000 vehicles to Korea, as part of a total European quota of 6 000 vehicles. At this time of crisis, which is having a particular effect on car workers, how do you explain Europe’s committing itself to such an agreement? Do you envisage a renegotiation of the controversial points that I have just mentioned? This is what a number of Member States and industrial sectors that I have just mentioned are calling for, anyway. Will you commit yourself at last, Commissioner, to ensuring greater transparency and to involving us MEPs to a greater extent? We, and the Commission, created the conditions for a negative image of the Polish plumber; let us not create a negative image of the Korean coach builder. Kader Arif (S&amp;D).

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by joining with the previous speakers in condemning in the harshest possible terms the coup d’état 
staged against the government of President Zelaya in Honduras. His arbitrary detention and his expulsion from the country are in breach of the constitutional order, which must be restored as quickly as possible. The military overthrow that led to Roberto Micheletti proclaiming himself as the new president brings to mind the darkest periods in the history of Central America that we have known, and this attack on democracy is unacceptable in our view. I therefore welcome the Organization of American States’ decision to suspend Honduras’ involvement in the organisation, and the acceptance of President Oscar Arias as a mediator helping to find a solution. However, I am also very concerned, Commissioner, about the commercial relations that the European Union maintains with this country. For several months negotiations have been taking place between the European Commission and Central America on a new-generation association agreement. Following the coup d’état
, meetings planned last week have been cancelled. We should be glad about that. I thought I understood you, but I should like to have more details. Is the Commission determined to suspend the negotiations until the institutional political situation in Honduras has returned to normal? That is what I and my political group are asking, but I should like to have more details concerning the Commission’s position on this point. Another issue that I wish to raise, Commissioner, is that of the Generalised System of Preferences Plus, from which Honduras benefits. Several organisations from civil society have reported arbitrary decisions and human rights violations since the coup d’état
, particularly as regards freedom of movement, association and expression. The European Commission has to be very firm on this issue. The GSP+ is an incentive, the benefits of which are dependent on clear commitments. The testimonies are more than enough to cast doubt on whether the State of Honduras is fulfilling its commitments under its self-proclaimed president. I therefore call on the Commission to launch an investigation into the possibility of temporarily withholding the preferences granted to Honduras under the GSP+. Karim Zéribi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is proposing that we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the single market and forge further ahead with its completion. In the field of transport, two areas are identified in Single Market Act II: rail and maritime transport. I am surprised not to see cabotage services provided by road, scheduled for 2013, mentioned here. This will have a massive impact on the environment and lead to more social dumping than is the case at present. I would like to think this was an oversight, though one might consider it a deliberate error. Commissioner, you can be very pleased with the achievements of the last 20 years, but you cannot hide the reality of the social landscape or the crisis affecting Europe on the job front. As far as the forthcoming reforms in both the maritime and the rail sectors are concerned, these are based on a one-size-fits-all approach, that of liberalisation. Commissioner, this headlong rush has to stop. The single market is not dogma. It is a tool that should serve economic development, environmental transition and the social wellbeing of our fellow citizens. We cannot reasonably take any more without introducing social and fiscal harmonisation measures that are effective with any future directive. There has to be a level playing field for everyone. My group will, in particular, be making sure that we avoid the abuses of the past and, for every area where the market is being liberalised, will demand that a social and environmental package be introduced so that competition is fair and brings development and prosperity for our continent. Karim Zéribi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to draw your attention to the issue of the Roma minority, which is very topical in France and in Europe. The European Union has, to its credit, invested heavily in its programmes to integrate the Roma populations. More than EUR 17 billion will be allocated over the period 2007-2013 via the European Social Fund (ESF), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and, to a lesser extent, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). However, there are numerous indications that these funds have been under-utilised. In Marseille, the city in which I was elected, 1 500 Roma live in inhumane and revolting conditions, which creates tensions. Expelling the Roma does not resolve their situation at all and does not address the real issue, which is their integration. We must act. Commissioner, you say that the integration of the Roma, who are Europeans, is as much the responsibility of the host country as it is of the country of origin. You are right. However, we must therefore strengthen control over the use of EU subsidies and ensure that the Commission reassesses, if necessary, the national strategies adopted. Furthermore, we should entrust the management of Structural Funds granted today to locally elected bodies, which will have an interest in solving the problem because they are closer to the citizen. Parliament will then have to ensure that the use of these funds is assessed regularly. Liem Hoang Ngoc,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the euro area is again entering recession. The exit strategy advocated by the Council and the Commission until last June has plunged us into crisis. Euroscepticism is gaining ground. In this context, the Van Rompuy report, which must define the next stage of economic and monetary union, has particular significance. Sadly, the Council has refused to involve Parliament fully in drafting this roadmap. Ms Thyssen’s report is therefore the opportunity for Parliament to invite itself to the debate in order to send a strong message. I salute the remarkable work done by Ms Thyssen, who has demonstrated the sort of constructive attitude that shows our fellow citizens that Parliamentary debate has a point. The point of this debate is to take stock of the levers so desperately lacking for the functioning of economic and monetary union. Firstly, an integrated banking union is needed to control the banks, guarantee deposits and resolve crises without taxpayers again having to foot the bill. Secondly, a budgetary union is needed, within which the serious budgetary approach of Member States is matched by support for sustainable development on a European scale. This union must be given a budgetary capacity fuelled by new own resources, allocation of which must be debated within the framework of the Union method, this being the only way to guarantee solidarity among the 27 Member States. Thirdly, a genuine democratic leap is needed, without which transfers of sovereignty will continue to be seen by our fellow citizens as so many powers commandeered by bureaucrats. Parliament, as the main agent of representative democracy, must therefore play a part at each stage of the European Semester. Parliament must be involved in the functioning of the European stability mechanism. Parliament must be able to monitor the troika, particularly when the International Monetary Fund itself declares that the troika has made a serious error. Last but not least, a social – fifth – pillar is needed to guarantee wage standards, preventing structural reforms from causing a recessionary spiral. A social pillar to prevent budgetary discipline from reducing the quality of public services and social protection. A social pillar to encourage integration of young people into the labour market and access to housing for all. A social pillar to reassure our fellow citizens, for whom Europe is synonymous with saving the banks on the one hand, but worsening most people’s circumstances on the other. That is the strong mandate that Parliament must give its President on the eve of the November and December Council meetings. The Council will hear this message even more clearly if tomorrow it receives – thanks to you, ladies and gentlemen– the largest possible majority. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, the October Council decided on a timetable for the implementation of June’s decisions. The banking union will therefore see the light of day in 2014. It will allow us to supervise 6 000 banks in the euro area. It will guarantee deposits and be responsible for resolving banking crises. This will prevent the taxpayers from having to pay the price once again, because the citizens, and workers in particular, are not the culprits responsible for the crisis; the real criminals are the greedy financiers. They have taken the role of police, accusing the citizens of always wanting too many social elements. However, the social pillar is exactly what is missing from your interim road map, Mr Van Rompuy; that and the democratic pillar. As a result, many of our citizens are becoming more Eurosceptic today. The members of the EP’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs affirmed in the Thyssen report that there cannot be genuine economic and monetary union without democracy and without a social pact. The European Parliament must have its say at each stage of the European Semester. It must be able to discuss the troika’s decisions. It must be involved in the European Stability Mechanism governance structure. Finally, budgetary discipline must, in each Member State, be accompanied by a substantial European budgetary capacity in order to deal with asymmetric shocks, as you say yourself, Mr Van Rompuy. However, this counter-cyclical fund must be financed using new, sustainable resources, and it must be managed under the Community method in order to prevent the collapse of the Union. Ladies and gentlemen, many of us agree that there cannot be a successful federal transition without solidarity, without social progress and without democratic progress. That is the message that our Parliament and its President must spread in the ongoing debate. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the ‘two-pack’ applies to France, as it does to most countries in the euro area. France, however, has just issued its latest government bonds at historically low rates. It has to get its economy growing again so as to reduce its deficits and continue to benefit from such rates. To that end, Ms Ferreira raises the possibility of proactive investment policies by proposing, like Mario Monti, to change the way deficits are calculated so as to distinguish the role of public investment. She also supports the creation of eurobonds, which are needed to curb speculation. Since the future of the euro is at stake, the conservatives would be taking on a serious responsibility if they rejected the amendments and compromises, including these two proposals. As for the Gauzès report, by generalising the reversed qualified majority principle, it places all the power in the hands of the Commission, whose recommendations are particularly controversial not only in Greece but also in France and elsewhere. The democratic debate should not be closed. Parliament should have the right to veto the Commission’s decisions. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has moved on to practical work and we have tried to improve its draft text in committee. We now have a basis of assessment including exchange transactions, derivatives, equities and bonds traded on the secondary market. Like the Commissioner, we want the financial transaction tax to be imposed on pension funds and undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), which, unfortunately, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wants to exclude. We also have two tax rates, including a lower rate for derivatives, which seems paradoxical given that we want to combat speculation. By and large, however, the compromise we are reaching will be an important step forward, especially if it obtains a large majority in plenary. This would send a strong signal to the Council, where political change in France is opening up new possibilities for European growth initiatives, funding for which could be achieved through the mobilisation of this first European tax instrument. This places the burden fairly and squarely on the financial sector, which is responsible for the crisis, and not on its victims, European citizens. The tax revenue will also help reduce the contribution of the Member States, which are being asked to reduce their deficit. In this way, Parliament is suggesting that it is not impossible to reconcile fiscal justice, deficit reduction and support for growth. This is a good omen, ladies and gentlemen, ahead of the informal European Council summit on growth, which is opening this evening. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Audy, would you include tax cuts in the public finances audit that you are proposing? Liem Hoang Ngoc,

– (FR)
 Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur for the political will she has displayed in this report. We all know that some Member States manipulate their corporate tax base more or less secretly to reduce their real level of taxation and practise tax dumping. That is why we, as socialists and federalists, have always supported the idea of moving towards tax harmonisation in the European Union. Unfortunately, by proposing a consolidated base that was merely optional, the European Commission did not seek to take a first step towards harmonising corporate tax, but simply to create a tax optimisation instrument. This was not acceptable to our political grouping, since the Europe we believe in is not a self-service Europe serving only corporate interests.
 It is, above all, a political and social Europe built for all, involving everyone. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I have fought for months to change the logic of the Commission’s text radically, namely, to move from a voluntary to a compulsory system and introduce a minimum level of taxation. Negotiations were not easy but we succeeded in reaching agreement because, beyond our political differences – which are significant – all of us around the table shared an ambitious vision of Europe. Despite her initial reluctance, the rapporteur ultimately accepted the principle of a compulsory common consolidated corporate tax base for all large companies in the EU. Unfortunately, we did not manage to establish a minimum rate but the report clearly identifies the problems posed by too large a spread in rates and calls for the issue of rates to be re-examined when reviewing the application of this text. We will monitor this closely, because for us, it is an indispensable second phase. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I call on you to give overwhelming support to Ms Thyssen’s report. In doing so, we will send a strong message to the Council and, above all, to citizens, who are the first to suffer from the evils of tax competition. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

Blue-card question. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Gauzès, you speak of the sovereignty of the people, but you have also spoken of the ‘two-pack’ for which you are the rapporteur. You want to transpose – and I am talking to you about a European text – you want to transpose a treaty into secondary European legislation. You want to transpose the treaty of austerity together with its symbol, the leaden rule. It is a leaden rule that will plunge Europe into recession, as my fellow Member, Mr Canfin, said. You want to transpose this leaden rule into secondary legislation even before the peoples of Europe have been able to take a decision and ratify the treaty. Mr Gauzès, my question is a simple one: you speak of the sovereignty of the people, so are you going to withdraw your Amendment 9 from this ‘two-pack’, which shows true contempt for democracy? Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

) The intergovernmental treaty that the European governments are about to sign is unacceptable for two reasons. It is unacceptable in terms of the procedure adopted, which is anti-democratic and rides roughshod over half a century of the Community method. It is also unacceptable in terms of content, in that it is aimed at tightening the already suffocating straitjacket of the Stability Pact and imposing unprecedented austerity policies throughout Europe. These policies can do nothing but plunge us into a lasting recession, destroy our social model and make the poorest citizens pay the price for a crisis of which they are the first victims. They will not resolve the debt problem as austerity will kill consumption and investment and, with them, any hope of growth or the recovery of public finances. The fact the ECB has just granted the banks a loan of EUR 489 billion for three years at 1% interest, while Greece has a knife put to its throat, is proof that Europe has currently got things completely the wrong way round. Curiously, these banks are not suspected of ‘moral hazard’, in contrast to the Member States, which the ECB is not allowed to finance directly. They will therefore be able to buy back sovereign bonds at 6 or even 10% and continue their speculative activities with this free money. This is not the Europe we want. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D
),

 – (FR)
 The new Treaty that the German right intends to push through would deprive the Member States of a budgetary policy by forcing them to implement austerity policies that are set to plunge Europe into recession without reducing deficits. Economic policy choices would be enshrined in the constitutions and placed under the authority of a Court of Justice. Automatic penalties would be applied to countries whose public deficit exceeds 3% of their GDP. However, this Treaty fails to include any measures for resolving the economic and social crisis: there is nothing about Eurobonds or about the ECB intervening on the primary market to purchase government bonds. Therefore, how can anyone be surprised about the rise in euroscepticism? We urgently need to show that a progressive economic strategy is possible. We call for the creation of a European treasury, the embryo of which could be the European Financial Stability Facility, and for an independent rating agency, attached to the European Court of Auditors. The power to rate sovereign debts would be taken away from private agencies, in which there are obvious conflicts of interest. We also propose the creation of an investment pact to revive the economy through the exclusion of investment expenditure from the calculation of public deficits. With an EU budget swelled by Eurobonds and the financial transaction tax, we would fund the upwards convergence of competitiveness levels and social and fiscal rules. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Draghi, ladies and gentlemen, this annual report has finally broken certain taboos. It calls on the Commission to create a European credit rating foundation and to consider temporarily suspending credit ratings for countries that require support from the Union. The report recognises the merit of the European Central Bank (ECB) repurchasing bonds on the secondary market, which has allowed banks to maintain their balance sheets and continue to borrow on the interbank market. This action prevented a liquidity crisis. Yet in order to resolve the sovereign debt crisis, the ECB needs to be authorised to intervene on the primary market when it becomes illiquid. Even Germany is struggling to obtain funds. Italian bonds are being issued at ever-higher rates. If there is no intervention, the risk of Italy defaulting will seriously compromise the health of the banks. The banks will approve fewer loans and will not be able to meet the new solvency ratio requirements. Parliament’s report also stresses the need for a European Treasury able to issue federal bonds at lower rates, as is the case in the United States. In the event of speculator activity, the ECB should be authorised to repurchase these eurobonds, like its counterparts in the US and the United Kingdom. Did you know that these two countries are generating funds at historically low rates, despite a rating downgrade for one of them? Ladies and gentlemen, we are not in the same situation as Germany in the 1920s – nowadays, production capacities are underused. Therefore, demand is not driving inflation. There is no cost inflation because we have wage moderation, or because the gloomy economy is keeping commodities costs low despite speculatory activity. We need to acknowledge that the time has come for bold monetary policies, given the current failure to recognise that budgetary orthodoxy is absurd in times of recession. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 The agreement of 27 October is flabbergasting. The austerity policies that it intends to include in the constitutions will plunge Europe into a recession where tax revenues will dry up and deficits will widen. They will increase the risks associated with holding sovereign debts, leading to higher interest rates. The banks will see their balance sheets deteriorate and will struggle to increase their capital. Only the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) would allow for a restructuring of debts and recapitalisations and defuse any new tension about rates. To do so, it would have to turn into the embryonic European Treasury, issuing Eurobonds which the European Central Bank (ECB) could buy back at a lower rate. There are no plans for this. The fund, which started off with EUR 440 billion, now only has EUR 250 billion. To raise the EUR 1 trillion supposed to reassure the markets, it will transform the sovereign debts held into derivatives to activate the ‘leverage effect’. However, the recession will increase the risk of defaults. We hardly dare imagine the effects of this securitisation of Italian and Spanish debts should these countries partly default. This agreement is explosive for the financial system, already under threat from austerity measures which are crippling growth. Turning to China rather than the ECB is detrimental to industry and employment in Europe. Liem Hoang Ngoc,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there will be no political Europe without a fiscal Europe. Unfortunately, the two issues that we are debating today demonstrate the Commission’s lack of ambition on that subject. As regards the system of taxation for parent companies with subsidiaries in other Member States, under the current directive, these groups are undertaxed, which is detrimental to public finances in the Member States. It has been a boon for transnational groups. In order to remedy this, I proposed in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that a parent company should only be exempt from paying tax on profits generated by subsidiaries on two conditions. Firstly, the parent company must hold the statutory minimum of 15% of company equity in another Member State for an uninterrupted period of at least two years in order to benefit from this tax regime. Sadly, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not accept that minimum period. Secondly, the profits distributed by a subsidiary to the parent company used to be taxed at a rate of 75% or more of the average tax rate in the EU Member States. I am pleased to say that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did agree to maintain the threshold of 70% of the average tax rate. The European Commission chose not to comment during our discussions, which was a pity. Consequently, Commissioner, we are left hoping that you will act on the message that we are sending, since Parliament is still not a colegislator on tax matters. The second symptom of your lack of concern about taxation is your failure to act when the Council quashed the directive on taxation of savings income. The ensuing vacuum has resulted in pick-and-mix bilateral agreements on the exchange of banking information, such as those concluded by the United Kingdom and Germany with Switzerland. Yet the Savings Tax Directive paved the way for automatic exchanges of information with several different tax havens, including Switzerland. The directive was the subject of a report that was adopted by a resounding majority in plenary. Although Mr Barnier has explained that there is no more money available to promote growth, applying the directive would allow us to generate EUR 200 billion for the public purse. A fiscal tool is essential if we are to recover from the crisis. Harmonised taxation is vital for an effective single market. Combating fraud and tax avoidance is crucial if we are to rebalance public accounts. For all these reasons, Commissioner, I can only urge you to do all you can to promote a fiscal Europe, in order to put an end to the Member States’ self-destructive rivalry. The main casualties of that rivalry are growth, public finances and solidarity among European citizens. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our fellow citizens are questioning the merits of austerity policies that are reducing their public services and squeezing their social security. Wherever these policies are rife, they are not succeeding in reducing public debt and bringing down unemployment. The contents of this ‘governance’ package – and I call them ‘contents’ deliberately – that we are discussing today are so ridiculous that even the economists are stunned, because they will prevent budgetary policy from adjusting to economic cycles. During the trialogue, the Commission representatives admitted to us themselves that they have not used any theoretical or econometric model as a basis for making sound predictions and recommendations. They admit that they are working on a purely intuitive basis. In the light of this, it is difficult to understand why the conservative, liberal and eurosceptic Members of this House have blindly attempted to toughen up the text proposed by the Commission. They are even less in a position to preach to us, considering that the governments led by friends of theirs have created these deficits through tax reductions that are as unfair as they are ineffective: is that not right, Mr Gauzès? They make grand statements about the Europe 2020 strategy, but they refuse to allow spending to prepare for the future, such as spending on investment, to be excluded from the calculation of the deficits. Yes, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, that is the crux of the debate as far as we are concerned! Let us reduce the deficits, yes, for example by going back on the tax gifts that have benefited the State’s creditors above all, but let us do it without sacrificing investment, training and jobs, because today’s investments are tomorrow’s jobs and the tax income that will follow, and this will allow us to reduce our deficits. This is the theorem that should appear on the frontispiece of the ‘governance’ package. My fellow conservative and liberal Members, some of you want to punish automatically States that are heretics to your dogma to the tune of billions of euros. They also want to punish countries that will not lower wages in order to regain their external balance. They believe that the deficits are primarily the product of bad intentions on the part of those States, as though the neoliberal model that you never question had not just been through its worst crisis since 1929, and as if it were not already leading to pressure on the buying power of ordinary people and causing a massive contraction in tax income: two problems that were at the root of the rise in private and public indebtedness in the first place. When it comes to the votes, socialists and democrats will send out a clear signal against this austerity package, which can only heighten the indignation that is rising throughout Europe. This clear signal is aimed at all workers in Europe and especially at our fellow citizens in France and Germany as they approach elections that will have a decisive impact on Europe’s future.

 Given the importance of this issue and the strict time constraints to which Parliament has had to work, we can all be pleased with what we have accomplished. In general, I agree with the priorities identified by the various reports, particularly the recognition of professional qualifications, the portability of pension rights, the rationalisation of procurement procedures, initiatives for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and access for all to certain basic banking services Certainly, in my opinion, other measures deserved to be highlighted, such as the issue of collective resources, but I am well aware that it was difficult to decide between these 50 proposals. I am also pleased that we were able to reach a compromise on the social clause, which states that any legislation on the Single Market should be subject to a social impact assessment and, if justified by the findings, should contain a reference to political and social rights. Finally, another reason for us to be satisfied is the fact that Parliament calls for guaranteed access, quality and affordability of services of general economic interest (SGEIs) and social services of general interest (SSGIs), and invites the Commission to take sectoral legislative initiatives in this area.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, 24 March, will be a symbolic day. In the first instance, it will be marked by the amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon that we have just voted for, which will allow a permanent European Stability Mechanism to be established. This mechanism allows the European Union to devise the first Eurobonds, which are designed to finance sovereign debt at low interest rates in the event of speculative attacks. In this respect, it is a shame that the process stopped halfway. To deal with the markets’ irrational exuberance, the revision of the Treaty ought to have been an opportunity to authorise the European Central Bank to do what the United States does and buy back public debt in the event of exchange rate tensions. The process is even more incomplete since the pay-off required is to implement the Competitiveness Pact, re-christened the Pact for the euro. This is the second symbol of tomorrow. This pact is backed unanimously by the Council, the Commission and the European Central Bank. Ladies and gentlemen, you all know the Washington Consensus: you loved it. Well, 24 March sees the birth of the ‘Brussels consensus’. The ‘Brussels consensus’ is the blind, roughshod application of neoliberal dogma: squeezing public services and the welfare state; wage austerity and minimal regulation of the financial markets. Ladies and gentlemen, the Council, the Commission and the ECB have short memories. They are proposing to transpose the Pact for the euro into the governance package so as to enshrine in our system the very policies that led to the economic crisis. In Spain, the UK, Ireland and elsewhere, the rise of household debt, which is fed by the finance industry, has been caused by none other than the crisis in buying power resulting from the pay restraint that has held sway for 20 years. The Pact for the euro unfortunately proposes to make wage austerity a permanent fixture. As for public debt, as well as being a consequence of the economic crisis, it is also a result of pointless tax reductions everywhere, advocated by liberals and conservatives. There was no explosion of public expenditure in Europe: quite the contrary. Budget and wage austerity, combined with the interest rate rises already planned by the European Central Bank, will end up killing off internal demand in Europe and killing off the recovery without reducing deficits. Tomorrow, we will be side by side with employees demonstrating against this ‘Brussels consensus’: this is the third symbol of 24 March. If we do not want to see a return of the likes of the brown shirts, whom Europe was created to stand against, the people’s elected representatives must stand with the people to denounce policies that are as unjust as they are ineffective.

 I am anxious to thank Mr Schwab and the shadow rapporteurs for their work. The Commission’s initial proposal was unacceptable because it intended to harmonise fully the rules concerning consumer rights, without systematically bringing them into line with the most favourable national legislation. In other words, many Member States would have had to remove from their national legislation provisions that in fact granted better protection to consumers. In France, two major acquis
 would have to be abandoned as a result: the ‘latent defect’ rule and the ruling that a doorstep seller is prohibited from collecting payment before the end of the cooling-off period. However my socialist colleagues and I succeeded in getting this approach altered and in making minimum harmonisation the norm. We also managed to enhance consumer rights on a whole range of points, in particular concerning information that has to be provided by the seller and provisions pertaining to the cooling-off period. One problem remains however: chapter V. We cannot accept that the rules on unfair terms be fully harmonised, because that would deprive Member States of their ability to react when faced with commercial practices that change daily and sometimes involve serious risks for consumers.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are debating today offers genuine advances. I am thinking, in particular, of Eurobonds, which the Union will need in order to finance the Europe 2020 strategy. Unfortunately, the right rejected in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs the principle of a tax on financial transactions at European level, despite having voted in favour of it in June. Its arguments for rejecting a European tax on financial transactions as a prelude to a global tax are the same as those put forward by the supporters of tax havens. It tells us that implementing a tax at European level alone would be disastrous for our financial sector. It also says that there would be a flight of capital from Europe. My answer to that is: so what if there is? The current volume of financial transactions is excessive compared to the needs of the real economy. Implementing this tax solely in Europe would help deflate the bubble. Furthermore, if the volume of speculative capital transactions, such as the credit derivatives at the origin of the crisis, were somewhat reduced, it would really help to consolidate the balance sheets of our banks. They would have a much greater incentive to finance the real economy. I would point out to those who are using the absence of an impact assessment for cover that no impact assessment was performed before the green light was given for a proliferation of derivatives. It is time, ladies and gentlemen, for all MEPs to face up to their responsibilities. The European Union must not continue to tag along behind a G20 dominated by the United States and China. It must lead the way in reforming our financial system. That is why I cannot support a text which chooses to overlook a tax on financial transactions. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 I would like to thank Mrs Weiler for this high quality report and the outcome of the negotiations with the Council, as the first reading agreement includes all the key elements that were put forward by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and which were approved in the vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. I am especially pleased to see that private companies and public authorities are now placed on an equal footing. The Commission’s initial proposal contained far more stringent penalties for public authorities, a position which our group felt was unacceptable as, unlike private undertakings, public sector bodies are not focused primarily on profit but rather operate in the general interest. The fact that the lender is entitled to compensation for recovery expenses also represents real progress since, up to now, many companies, particularly SMEs, have chosen not to reclaim late-payment interest from borrowers for the simple reason that the cost of the relevant procedures outweighed any financial gains. Finally, the maximum payment period of 30 days set out in the text seems reasonable, given that there is some scope for flexibility, notably for public healthcare bodies, a point that our group deemed particularly important.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, the ECOFIN Council approved the principle of the European Semester. As a federalist, I can only welcome such progress. However, coordinating budgetary policy is one thing; defining their content is another. That is why strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact is a serious mistake. The austerity treatment dogmatically imposed on the whole of Europe is already making its initial effects felt. Spain and Ireland are experiencing ever more difficulties, and the Markit survey, published at the end of August, shows that this treatment is responsible for the stagnation in European growth and, before long, the stagnation in German growth. The series of repressive measures outlined on the agenda of the next informal ECOFIN meeting is even more serious. Imposing automatic financial sanctions on States that are already facing budget problems is irresponsible. It will inevitably fuel the criticisms in all the Member States with regard to their national contributions to the EU budget. Two and a half million citizens expressed the first opposition to the austerity package on the streets of France yesterday. Instead of preserving social safety nets and establishing the social harmony in the EU that is necessary for the recovery, the Council and the Commission are destroying them. Do they measure the impact of such decisions only by the increasing level of Euroscepticism among citizens? For the sake of European integration and of the citizens for whom it is being undertaken, it must be acknowledged, ladies and gentlemen, that strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact is an economic aberration. It is also a serious political mistake. Liem Hoang Ngoc,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the own-initiative report on which we are voting this week is of particular symbolic importance at a time when the markets are unable to assess the risks associated with the economic situation in the euro area. Having demanded severe budget adjustment policies, they now doubt the capacity of Member Sates to kick-start their growth and, hence, to obtain the tax revenue necessary to pay the interest on their debt. Unfortunately, no risk assessment can be carried out in the deeply uncertain context in which the global economy now finds itself. Such an assessment is all the more important in the European Union, where the production capacity utilisation rate is at an all-time low. Instead of investing, companies are mothballing machines because, despite the initial signs of recovery at the end of 2009, demand is lacking. Growth would even end up going into reverse if restrictive measures were to nip the recovery in the bud. The first aim of our report was precisely to determine the optimum time for launching policies for emerging from the crisis. We proposed maintaining the support measures until the normal production capacity utilisation rate was restored. We therefore suggested ratifying the principle of anti-cyclical budgetary policies, which were successfully established during the first phase of the crisis in 2008 and 2009, and which are in line with the spirit of the reform of the 2005 Stability Pact. These policies entail using automatic stabilisers, in other words, in earmarking surpluses from the primary budget for debt repayment at the top of the cycle, and in allowing Member States to borrow the resources necessary for stimulus packages at the bottom of the cycle. We are currently at the bottom of the cycle. Interest rates are definitely under pressure and are threatening the sustainability of the debt. This being the case, the European Central Bank was right to announce that it would buy back some debt to enable Member States to diversify their sources of finance. Nevertheless, in addition to the fact that this concept of sustainability has never been defined in the economic literature, can the risk premiums demanded by the markets be deemed justifiable? No, if we consider that risk in the mortgage derivatives market, just as in the public-debt market, is impossible to assess. This is why, in our report, we proposed that particular attention be paid to the structural deficit indicator rather than the focus being … (The President cut off the speaker)
 This is why, in our report, we proposed that particular attention be paid to the structural deficit indicator rather than the focus being on the current account deficit, the scale of which is due to the deterioration in the actual budget deficit. This is the result of the crisis, which has weakened growth and concomitant tax revenue. This revenue has also been adversely affected by the lowering of taxes, which did not have the expected impact on supply. Our report seeks to offer three recommendations combined with some operational indicators. The first is to maintain support measures until the recovery has been consolidated. The second is to monitor the structural deficits, which are still close to equilibrium, despite the deterioration in actual budget deficits, in order to send a reassuring signal to the markets as to the state of public finances. The third is to assess the efficiency of tax expenditure and, in particular, of certain tax reductions which are related to the fall in tax revenue. Unfortunately, for the liberals and the conservatives in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, common sense counts for little; the impact of the crisis counts for little; and the fact that the massive debt is also due to the bank bail-out plans counts for little. Only their blind faith in the efficiency of the financial markets counts; only dogmatic compliance with a manifestly out-of-date Stability Pact counts. They do not see any need to create the tools required for economic governance, which is essential in order to strengthen the Union. It is a case of putting Europe on a starvation diet and doggedly trying to meet the criteria in the pact without any guarantee of success and at the risk of destroying the recovery, and too bad for social cohesion. That is the position that they have defended in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Since that vote, the economic health of Europe has deteriorated further. The European Central Bank and the Commission have finally come up with monetary and budgetary instruments which should enable us to improve economic governance in the euro area. However, the markets have fallen once again, unsettled as they are by the austerity plans. The Ecofin Council had to start all over again on Monday. Against this background, the amendments which we are tabling are, all in all, very moderate; and we are tabling some new ones too. They argue for flexible implementation of the Stability Pact, so that an unwelcome austerity cure can be avoided. They advocate a public credit rating agency to shield Member States from the diktat of the markets. These are the signals that Parliament must send out. Mr Karas, the time for ideological knee-jerk reactions has passed, as has the time for short-term national electoral moves. Europe needs policies which are motivated by a real desire to strengthen the Union. If you and your group are not up to this task, if you are no longer capable of representing the general interest, you can be sure that our citizens will be able to draw their own conclusions, for the future of the euro area is now at stake.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, two taboos have been broken in recent weeks. Firstly, the ECB can now monetise sovereign debts. Secondly, EU expenditure can now be financed by borrowing and, in particular, when the stabilisation and support funds are created. There is a third taboo, which unfortunately has not been broken, and it is the Stability and Growth Pact, which some Members of this House are dogmatically demanding be strengthened. Commissioners, we socialists are in favour of federalism. We are in favour of the coordination of budget policies. However, if the coordination of budget policies means overriding national parliaments so as to put their citizens on a starvation diet, then I fear that that might be a fine EU idea which will itself end up starving to death. This is the real threat which we are all facing at the moment. Commissioners, the austerity plans in Greece, Spain, Portugal and France do not have any chance of succeeding. I ask you to acknowledge this. Liem Hoang Ngoc,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Giegold’s report is particularly significant given the current macro-economic debate. This report is all the more relevant given the fact that its author is a German MEP who wanted to draw the attention of Europeans to the distorted effects, for the countries of the euro area, of the German strategy of reducing labour costs in the single currency system. The German Government is, in fact, about to drag the euro area and the whole of the European Union into generalised wage deflation with damaging macro-economic consequences. Particularly in the absence of consistent structural funds and sufficient budgetary resources, and faced with the impossibility of devaluation, Member States with current accounts in deficit are condemned, in order to resist, to trim their wages and reduce the perimeter of their social security systems. The result is firstly a slowdown in internal demand which, since the second quarter of 2008, has led to negative growth, and this was even before the start of the liquidity crisis. Secondly, we are seeing a rise in the personal debt of households with modest incomes and means, whose purchasing power is no longer increasing. Their debt to acquire homes was fed by the whole deregulated financial machinery, in Spain, in the United Kingdom and in Ireland, with the disastrous consequences we have observed in the subprime crisis. Ladies and gentlemen, listening to the debates in committee, a significant number of MEPs would seem to be forgetting the lessons of this crisis. This crisis is far from behind us. The current recovery is all the more fragile given the fact that Europe is continuing with wage deflation and the Commission, but also the President of the Eurogroup and the President of the European Central Bank – whom we heard on Monday – are calling on the Member States to prematurely adopt exit policies that are comparable to real austerity plans. These policies risk nipping growth in the bud when it has barely become positive again, even though capacity utilisation rates remain low. These policies will fail to reduce the deficits in Greece, in Spain and elsewhere, because the expected tax revenue will fail to materialise also. They will exacerbate unemployment and will fuel social tensions. The Giegold report has the merit of drawing attention to some of these macro-economic imbalances. Unfortunately, the final version, amended by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, refuses to condemn wage deflation. However, on the whole, the debate opened by Mr Giegold may be beneficial at a time when neoliberal dogma thrown into doubt by the crisis is back in force in Parliament, in the Council and in the Commission.

Mr President, Madam President, I thank Mrs Thun Und Hohenstein for the conscientiousness of her work and the overall quality of her report. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I am delighted that the vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has made it possible to integrate into the final report a number of ideas that we wanted to see emerge. The first is the need to adopt a more qualitative approach in respect of the implementation of the Internal Market Scoreboard, enabling the causes of the transposition deficit to be identified. We do not underestimate the usefulness of the statistical data and the pressure that comes from promoting the EU’s good and bad students, but in our opinion, the Commission ought to be more ambitious and try to make this scoreboard a tool designed to appreciate the difficulties encountered by the Member States within the context of the transposition process. All the more so since we all know that the transposition deficit may sometimes be due not to ill will by the Member States, but to the mediocre quality of the European legislation to be transposed. The second aspect I focused on is the need to strengthen dialogue between the Commission and the Member States throughout the transposition period. The more the information exchanges take place upstream, the more it will be possible to prevent the risk of non­transposition or incorrect transposition. The report does, however, pose a problem on one point: this relates to paragraph 10, which did not initially appear in Mrs Thun Und Hohenstein’s draft report. This paragraph proposes the creation of an internal market test for all new proposed legislation. We are strongly opposed to this since such a test seems to us to be pointless at best and dangerous at worst. Indeed, the review of any barriers to the internal market already takes place during the impact studies carried out by the European Commission with each new legislative proposal. We would not like this internal market test to be used as a pretext for undermining social or environmental advances. We could not agree to it in those circumstances. Liem Hoang Ngoc,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this period of crisis, public finances have been heavily used, initially to save the financial system and then to cushion the social and economic impact. In this context, there is much talk of public deficits, the spending of Member States is being attacked, but the fall in tax receipts is allowed to fade into the background. One forgets that, each year in the European Union, EUR 200 billion evades taxation, and these are resources which could have been used for essential recovery policies, resources which would allow us calmly to face up to what some are calling, in inverted commas, the demographic time bomb. This is why the texts that we are discussing today are so important. The introduction of common tools and absolute transparency between the Member States in the area of debt recovery are vital steps if we are to ensure that no citizen, no company, can evade their fiscal responsibility, and that everyone contributes to the collective effort. We must give the tax authorities of each country in the Union the resources to fulfil their missions. We must also emphasise the extent to which a healthy fiscal policy is essential. Everyone is currently concerned about Greece. We are seeing today the extremes to which the lack of an effective fiscal apparatus leads. It is not merely the crisis that is harming the Karamanlis government; it is, above all, its predecessor’s lack of political courage in failing to reform Greece’s fiscal administration and thus to create an effective tax recovery tool. We hope, in this matter, that the Union will use all of the resources at its disposal to confirm its solidarity with Greece. I hope that the vote we take on Wednesday confirms the vote in committee and results in some encouraging tax recovery texts. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

Mr President, to my mind, the Commission’s proposed Agenda for Change raises many questions, chief amongst them the matter of how exactly the principle of differentiation is to be applied. The Commission’s wish is that, from 2014, the countries receiving EU development aid should be chosen purely on the basis of the criterion of per capita wealth. As Baroness Ashton has said, this is not just a matter of money; it merits a proper policy debate on how we define our priorities for international cooperation. And I do not think this differentiated approach is consistent with the spirit of the Cotonou Agreement. I firmly believe that those ACP countries that have recorded good economic performances should be encouraged in their transition towards more sustainable growth; they should not be improperly penalised for having managed to secure growth through discipline, good governance and prudent economic policy. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

. – (FR) 
Mr President, all of us are well aware of how tedious and time-consuming negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) can be. My feeling is that this has indeed been the case with this issue. On the one hand, it is not hard to see that only 18 of the 36 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries which have embarked on or signed an EPA have ratified it. The remainder are therefore encouraged to conclude and implement an agreement quickly, if they do not want to see their negotiation efforts ruined by, for example, the deadline of 2014. On the other hand, we have all known, since 2007, that this regulation was merely temporary, being incompatible with the rules of the World Trade Organisation. These facts therefore lead me to believe that our rapporteur’s proposal is the best possible compromise if we want to give the Commission services and the ACP countries the time they need to conclude their EPA negotiations. Nevertheless, if the date 1 January 2016 does not win a majority in tomorrow’s vote, I would call on my fellow MEPs to reject the Commission’s proposal. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank our two rapporteurs for the work they have done on this issue. It was necessary because we started from a very low base with the Commission’s basic proposal: no specific mention of the outermost regions, which are directly affected by competition from Latin American countries; no automatic activation of the stabilisation mechanism; no possibility for Parliament to ask for a safeguard investigation to be initiated; non-compliance of social and environmental standards as possibly constituting an unfair competitive advantage. That is why it is extremely important that tomorrow’s vote validates the progress made on these points in the Committee on International Trade (INTA). Nonetheless, it is not sufficient, because we know that the activation thresholds for both these regulations are so high that they render these mechanisms practically inoperable. Furthermore, the Commission must provide for an additional financial envelope to support EU banana production. We must bear in mind that numerous jobs are at stake in these European regions, which already have record unemployment rates. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, faced with the profound changes which our world is experiencing today, the European Union is duty bound to reform its generalised system of preferences. Like all compromises, this is no exception. Although it is satisfactory from a strictly commercial point of view, it is far from perfect, because we must bear in mind that this regulation is aimed at developing countries. By developing its new paradigm of differentiation, the Commission says that it wants to refocus its activities to help the poorest countries. At first sight, this seems to be completely acceptable to us. However, in order to achieve this, the Commission has developed a strictly accounting approach that is based upon the sole criterion of GDP per capita. We can clearly see the limits of this approach. What about the numerous middle income developing countries whose economies are not very diversified and which are vulnerable to climatic uncertainties? The compromise found with the Council does not resolve this issue and that is why I call upon my colleagues to vote in favour of the three amendments that will be tabled on this text. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

 I welcome the position adopted by Parliament today. I would like to address two key points in this report. It was important that Parliament spoke out strongly against the Commission’s proposal to reduce the specific allocation for outermost regions (ORs) by almost half. This cut in funding is all the more unfair in that it affects the money set aside to compensate for the disadvantages of these regions which, by definition, are not decreasing. They are described as structural and permanent in our Treaties. Consequently, these regions would be the only territories, and I mean the only ones, under the cohesion policy that would see a cut in their funds, which would not be justified by growth effects or a change in category of regions. Secondly, I would like to focus on our call for a comparative analysis of pricing in these regions. Economic mechanisms that go against the principles of the single market seem to be at work here and often lead to extremely worrying social movements. In this area, we need to have better informed and targeted action to meet this urgent demand of the people. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, this initiative comes from a good place. Work on education and training must be a priority when it is not only essential for the employability of our young people but also an investment for the future, a gauge of our ability to maintain dynamic and sustainable development. That being said, I am still extremely dubious about how consistent European action is overall. If the EU is not capable of implementing real solutions for growth, if it is still obsessed with punitive austerity, sterile austerity, austerity for austerity’s sake, there will be no growth for small and medium-sized enterprises, no jobs for young people and all of our efforts will be in vain. Similarly, if the fight against youth unemployment is our priority, how do you explain your proposal to reduce certain funds dedicated to the outermost regions by almost 50%, Commissioner? These regions where youth unemployment is at over 60%, these regions which you promised to protect, find themselves being sanctioned more than any others. Where is the consistency? Where is the justice? This decision is unacceptable and we are against. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

 This DCI/BAM text brushes aside the mandate that was given to Parliament’s negotiating team, which was to observe the spirit and the letter of the Treaty of Lisbon, to place Parliament on an equal footing with the Council in all programming decisions relating to the choice of strategic priorities and financial allocations, and not to set a negative precedent for Parliament prior to the forthcoming negotiations on the future external aid financing instruments 2014-2020. By applying Article 291 TFEU on strategic programming decisions, Parliament’s power of scrutiny will be more limited than it was with the comitology procedure under the old Treaty. All this is a result of the shameful blackmail by the Council, which was threatening to block the entire package of measures if Parliament rejected any one of the four texts that were voted on. I therefore voted against this text, because our Parliament had a duty to defend its rights as set out in the Treaty of Lisbon, whilst demonstrating that its plenary remained sovereign in the face of the Council’s efforts at destabilisation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our coordinator Thijs Berman could not be with us in the end this evening for personal reasons. However, I know that he shares my views on this issue fully. The conciliation on this legislative package was tedious and time-consuming and, while the outcome on the human rights instrument and the enlarged Industrialised Countries Instrument (ICI Plus) is satisfactory, we still have a very long way to go with regard to the Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM). The compromise reached on this text thus brushes aside the mandate that was given to our negotiating team, which was to place Parliament on an equal footing with the Council in all of the programming decisions relating to the choice of strategic priorities and financial allocations. I say this because it is indeed Parliament’s powers and the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon itself that are we are talking about here. The choice of programming priorities is a highly political decision, in which our Parliament must have its say. By categorically refusing to grant Parliament any such power of oversight and by employing shameful blackmailing tactics, the Council has, once again, made a reprehensible ideological withdrawal. Member States must, however, understand that the European Union’s external actions are now a responsibility that is shared between our institutions. That is why Parliament must retain its authority and reject the proposal on the BAM. This is the only means we have of showing the Council and the Commission that Parliament wishes to see greater transparency in Community decisions. If we lose this battle, it could lead to an absurd situation in which we would have to wait for a new Treaty in order to obtain, at long last, the powers that are in fact already conferred on us by the Treaty of Lisbon.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to highlight Parliament’s support for the creation of a category of intermediate regions and I would point out that this will in no way – contrary to what some have said – be an additional burden on the Community budget. What we are proposing here is a revolution in the concept of transition with an unchanged budget. Our desire is to move towards a fairer system which helps those regions that have substantial difficulties. This transitional zone between 75 and 90% of European GDP is a real commitment towards a consolidated cohesion policy for the years to come. Furthermore, I am delighted that our resolution has confirmed Parliament’s commitment towards the outermost regions. The latter are subject to specific and permanent disadvantages which justify this solidarity effort, in order for them to effectively be the Union’s interface with the world. Patrice Tirolien,

 Madam President, the position unanimously adopted today by our Parliament shows just how vitally important the issue of implementing powers is to this House. Nevertheless, to turn to the subject of the Banana Accompanying Measures, this agreement is embarrassing with regard to our ACP banana-producing partners. Indeed, one year after these countries legitimately obtained compensation from the Commission, they have still not received the funds, even though the Geneva Agreement is hitting them hard. Therefore, they are the ones I am addressing again today when I say that it is precisely because we want to relay our demands even further that this House must have its say in the EU’s strategy and general guidelines for external aid. We are determined not to fall into the trap set by the Commission and the Council. Transparency of European decisions must be at the heart of our work. This is the very spirit of the Treaty and the essence of history. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

Shortly after the Geneva Agreement was signed, Colombia and Peru obtained a greater tariff reduction, thus proving that the agreement provides no legal certainty and has not settled the banana dispute as it claims. This differential treatment prompted Ecuador and Guatemala to demand equal treatment and threaten to lodge further appeals at the WTO. Furthermore, this agreement seriously harms a sector that provides countless jobs not only in our ACP partner countries but also in the outermost regions (ORs). The aid the EU is providing to support producers in the ORs has been calculated on the basis of the laws approved at the WTO in 2006. However, neither the December 2009 agreement nor the agreement with the Andean countries was anticipated in the POSEI. As for the aid earmarked for ACP producers, it is not sufficient to enable them to adapt to the new tariff situation. To give one’s assent to this agreement is to support the Commission in a strategy that is inconsistent with the EU’s effort in favour of the ORs and the ACP countries. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to focus my speech on Mr Goerens’ report, which deals with the ACP Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM). As I myself come from one of the only European regions to produce bananas, I can only show solidarity with the ACP producers in question. Solidarity, first and foremost, because a strong historical link unites the European Union to these countries, and we should do our utmost to ensure that they, too, are able to maximise the benefits of globalisation, of which they are, more often than not, the first victims. Solidarity, also, because the trade concessions generously granted by the Commission to the WTO are in danger of dealing a fatal blow to this agricultural sector in our ACP partner countries. Solidarity, but definitely not naivety, lastly, since the proposal for a BAM regulation as tabled by the Commission put much too much emphasis on the economic diversification aspect. Given the loss of tariff preference that resulted from the WTO agreement, this programme’s main goal is clearly to ensure the sustainability of ACP banana exports and hence, to help make them competitive. Furthermore, let us be honest, the funds set aside by the BAM are by no means enough and do not extend over a long enough period to make diversification happen. Finally, I would add that, if we are aware of the urgency of the situation, we can accept these accompanying measures being financed through the extensive redeployment of heading IV of the budget. The Council must be responsible and work towards finding a viable solution for the multiannual financing of this programme. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome this debate today. It once again shows the need for the Union to appreciate and make the most of its regional diversity. At this time when we are negotiating the new 2014-2020 framework programmes, I think it important to emphasise the amendments from which specific regions must benefit. Issues of continuity and territorial cohesion must be at the heart of our concerns. The development of mountain regions, islands and sparsely populated areas, however, requires more than just a set of derogations. We must adopt a horizontal approach. We must put in place instruments capable of making Union action in all areas coexist in synergy, thereby increasing their added value. Moreover, as a representative of an outlying region, I look forward to the new Union strategy on the outermost regions, which the Commission services have promised for early 2011.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when this text came before the Committee on Regional Development, I managed to introduce the idea of an extension of the exemption authorising the production of reconstituted milk in Martinique and Guadeloupe, following the example of the sustainable growth model which proved its worth in Madeira. Unfortunately, there was no consensus on this position at the last trialogue. This is regrettable for two reasons. Firstly, in terms of substance, dairy production in the French overseas departments would offer multiple unmissable opportunities: the strengthening of the cattle industry, self-sufficiency in a basic foodstuff and the creation of jobs. Secondly, in terms of content, our Parliament as a whole was unable to reach a decision on my proposal since it wanted to pass this text at first reading via an informal procedure that I oppose. Be that as it may, our work on this POSEI regulation will continue very soon during the mid-term review of this regulation. At that point, I will again request an exemption in the other French overseas departments. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

Mr President, is Haiti condemned to misfortune? Since its independence, natural disasters have given way to political catastrophes there, and here we are today faced with a tragedy of historic proportions. There are dead, injured, countless destroyed buildings and the ruin of national political structures and cooperation structures. We must beat fate. The European Union must participate in this twin emergency and reconstruction effort. We owe it to our numerous ties with Haiti, ties that are, first and foremost, historic: a former colony, Haiti was the most prosperous of them all; secondly, diplomatic: the Cotonou Agreement makes the island a privileged partner; and, finally, geographical, since Haiti is a neighbour of the European Union thanks to the outermost regions. Moreover, the crisis in Haiti represents the first test of the new European External Action Service, which you head up, Mrs Ashton. That has been conclusive up to now. This disaster also underlines the challenges and the improvements that we must make to this structure, since the solidarity movement of our continent aside, the US reaction raises questions about our mobilisation capacity. Thus, the remarkable efforts in favour of European coordination, the Member States’ contributions, must not conceal the difficulty of the discussions concerning the deployment of the European Gendarmerie Force. While it is crucial for the European Union’s expenditure to be guided by the United Nations, these difficulties lead to the conclusion that the European Union must equip itself with an autonomous, integrated structure with the means to deal with tasks as complex as a humanitarian emergency. Finally, the reconstruction phase represents an immense challenge. There is no shortage of tasks: political, administrative, economic, social and environmental. We are perhaps at year zero of a new era for Haiti. This is a major political challenge for a Europe that must assert itself as a visible leader in this process. Patrice Tirolien,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Guinea is currently being rocked by tragic events that have shocked the international public and flouted the law. Indeed, on 28 September 2009, the military junta led by Captain Dadis Camara carried out the bloody repression of a peaceful demonstration bringing together all of the opposition parties. Now, the Cotonou agreements base relations between the European Union and its ACP partners on respect for human rights and democratic principles. Therefore, Captain Dadis Camara’s unilateral decision to postpone the elections and to refuse to raise the issue of his candidacy for Guinean president is a serious failure to honour the commitments made to hold free and transparent elections within one year. The European Union must therefore take immediate action in line with the principles and the permanent values that underpin its action so that this violence, which represents so many human rights violations, stops. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the compromise resolution is fully in line with our values and principles, but I am particularly anxious to emphasise here Article 10 of this text, namely the suspension of the fisheries agreement protocol between the European Union and the Republic of Guinea until the democratic process has begun. I can hear people wondering whether such a decision would have disastrous socio-economic consequences for the population but, faced with the violence of 28 September, we must recognise that the Guinean Government is scarcely concerned about the living conditions of its citizens and that it leaves us with no other option than to be firm. Since its independence in 1958, Guinea has only ever known dictatorial regimes. Patrice Tirolien,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.
 – (FR) 
Mr President, the worrying developments concerning the political situation and security in Guinea require a firm response by the European Union. Indeed, as you know, on 28 September 2009, troops under the Guinean Government carried out the bloody repression of a peaceful demonstration uniting all of the opposition parties, causing 157 deaths and injuring more than a thousand people, some of whom suffered particularly vile instances of rape and mutilation. The Republic of Guinea is a country that has experienced only two dictatorial regimes since its independence in 1958. It is time for this infernal spiral to come to an end. The European Union, its Member States and its institutions had already condemned Moussa Dadis Camara’s coup d'état
 on 28 December 2008. As is procedure, the Council then applied Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement to establish a road map with the Guinean authorities, to be used as a framework for democratic transition. This list of measures included, in particular, the organisation of free and transparent elections within a year and the commitment that members of the CNDD, notably Moussa Dadis Camara, would not stand in these elections. Captain Camara’s decision to postpone the organisation of elections until spring 2010 and his refusal to raise the issue of whether he would stand for the Guinean Presidency were a sign of what was to come, with the current escalation. Thus, the demonstration that was bloodily repressed on 28 September was aimed precisely at calling on the junta to honour its commitments. The reaction of the government in office in Conakry shows its true intentions quite clearly: to eliminate all forms of democratic opposition in order to remain in power. In response, the international community has unanimously condemned these violent actions and the Guinean regime. Outraged by these massacres, our Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries recently refused, quite rightly, to vote for the Fisheries Agreement between the European Union and Guinea. Today, and in light of the latest events, the European Parliament would like to know the decisions the Council intends to take to address this situation. First of all, does the Council intend to push for the creation of an international commission of inquiry on the events of 28 September? How does the Council intend to act to ensure that the CNDD respects its commitments, namely to organise free and transparent elections as soon as possible, without the participation of Moussa Dadis Camara or another member of the CNDD? With regard to Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, what measures does the Council intend to take against the Guinean junta? Finally, what concrete commitments has the Council made to support the different initiatives run by ECOWAS, the African Union and the International Contact Group on Guinea? Pervenche Berès,

 Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs sees this end-of-year meeting as of major significance, since in order to achieve a genuine economic and monetary union we must revisit its foundations, which clearly did not withstand the crisis in which we find ourselves. The work done by this Parliament, under the responsibility of Ms Thyssen – whom we all thank for the excellent quality of the work – is meant to make clear, to define, Parliament’s position with a view to this major European Council meeting in December. I am therefore surprised by the absence of Herman Van Rompuy, its President, for whom this work is intended. In addition, I consider that the result of our vote here will give our sherpas a mandate to represent us in the negotiations in preparation for this work. We also consider that this meeting cannot be downplayed or underestimated in the light of the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework. Rewriting a genuine economic and monetary union must remain the priority. In this area, it is necessary to raise the social issue: we have been greatly struck by the fact that the document put on the table by Mr Van Rompuy in June defines four pillars, without ever mentioning the social dimension. Yet if you look at the Treaty of Maastricht, if you look at the current state of economic and monetary union, it is obvious that there is an imbalance between the economic policies defined in Article 121 and the employment policies defined in Article 148. However, if you rebuild economic and monetary union on the basis of Mr Van Rompuy’s proposals, without taking account of this original balance, you will destabilise the entire mechanism. Moreover, Parliament, our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, also sets great store by parliamentary control, democratic control, and therefore the chance for Parliament to participate, under the ordinary legislative procedure, in the Annual Growth Survey establishing the framework for this European Semester. A final point, Mr President, to highlight an element not mentioned often enough. If we want the troikas to succeed, they must be expanded to include the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which has today denounced the failure to abide by the ILO fundamental conventions in Greece, following the work of the troika. A genuine economic and monetary union cannot ignore the very foundations of the European social model. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, here are three debates one after the other in our order of business, in which you are at the heart of the discussion. You have led some of these debates with Commissioner Andor, which is right, as they discuss industrial policy, which is also at the heart of European jobs. However, a key figure is missing from your debate – that is, Commissioner Barnier – because it is evident that, behind several strategies that are at play, it is strategies for financing the economy that lead to the unravelling of the industrial fabric of our regions, and it is also the stitch you will need to knit, if you will permit the expression. I therefore thank you for having taken the initiative of this working group, which is a logical link between the reasoning on raw materials and that on the car industry. What is required is a global strategy that combines the issue of research and development with the issue of quality and jobs. I am always struck by the extent to which Europeans have been mobilised and shocked at the idea that they could no longer control access to rare earths as if it were a strategic issue, rather like what the Americans have sometimes done. Yet when considering the issue of iron and steel, Europeans do not consider it just as strategic for our economies. We allow Mr Mittal to behave simply like a financier and, contrary to everything we have learned in our economics textbooks, rather than create added value, he tries to go up the added value chain by destabilising and destroying production units on the European sites so he can go and buy mines, where he can organise speculation better. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament will, in adopting Mr Ferber’s report, draw important lessons from MiFID I by adopting a text that ensures that almost all financial transactions will have to take place on regulated venues. That is the meaning we must give this text. High-frequency trading, a technique allowing a large number of orders to be executed in a few milliseconds, will now be highly constrained. The crisis has brought to light the abusive practices linked to the use of high-frequency trading by some financial players, disrupting the functioning of financial markets to obtain considerable profits. The position adopted by Parliament is a move in the right direction by discouraging use of this practice; it will help to put finance back where it belongs, that is to say, serving the real economy and long-term investment. With this report, Parliament also wishes to tackle food speculation, which can be devastating for entire populations, by introducing position limits for the various players operating on trading venues. The destabilising effects of commodity speculation are increasingly clear, particularly on foodstuff markets. With this in mind, the proposals adopted today are a first step in the right direction, insofar as they impose limits on positions that may be taken by those operating on trading venues. This report also allows us to take a significant step forward: the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will be able to intervene to prohibit the sale of certain financial products acknowledged as toxic to the economy. In conclusion, I would like to talk about an important point linking the discussion on MiFID I and the text we are going to adopt here. When considering MiFID I, Parliament’s main contribution concerned, the issue of advice that investors, particularly small investors, must be given when undertaking an investment. Financing conditions for such advice remain a point of discussion on which we must provide clarity to ensure that everyone, irrespective of income, may access such advice on terms that are transparent and actually enable them to invest on an informed basis.

Mr President, I hesitate somewhat in giving Mr Eppink the opportunity to speak even more. All the same, I would like to give him the chance to correct what he said with regard to the latest International Monetary Fund observations, because, on reading carefully –
 as you clearly have not –
 what the IMF says about the European situation it is exactly the opposite of what you said. In fact, the IMF tells us that the policies currently being followed will lead to more austerity, something which, moreover, can be seen by any person who is intellectually honest –
 clearly, still not the case with you –
 in certain countries where extremely harsh prescriptions have been applied under the authority of the Commission. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner De Gucht, could you tell Commissioners Rehn and Andor that this Parliament takes the European Semester procedure seriously? To that end, when, on 28 November, the Commission puts on the table the annual growth review, which will serve as our underlying thread for 2013, we would like them to have several messages in mind. Firstly, to take account of the Growth Pact called for by the Heads of State or Government, on 28 and 29 June; next, the lessons from what the International Monetary Fund tells us, namely that a roadmap based only on austerity clearly has no chance of getting the European Union moving again.  Lastly, we think that the purpose of having an annual growth review and a definition of a European vision worked out before the European Council is to gain the means not simply to condemn each Member State in relation to its budgetary policy but also to draw up a common roadmap, enabling us, for instance, to correct macroeconomic imbalances. Please tell your colleagues that we would like two important things. The first is the possibility for Parliament to be involved in defining this European roadmap. For that we need a document we are able to amend, even though, formally, we do not currently have powers of codecision. Then, if the Member States are required, alongside national reform programmes and stability and convergence programmes, to submit national programmes for jobs, these documents must then be taken seriously. Member States that do not take them seriously must be penalised or, at least, called on to do so with a vigilance not shown by Mr Rehn this year.

Mr President, clearly, Mr Eppink thinks it necessary to play tit for tat and I would willingly tell him that he should know the French situation better and that, clearly, the rules that apply here do not necessarily do so elsewhere. In particular, the country from which I come and which you undoubtedly do not know as well as I do, is one where the demographic situation is nothing like that seen in other European countries, which makes it possible, in a difficult climate in which the President of the French Republic is seeking to re-establish conditions for a fruitful social dialogue to conduct reform, to have a mandate based on a decision imposed in relation to the record of his predecessor.

Mr President, the keystone of the European Union, the dimension that was lauded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, is solidarity. However, there can be no solidarity without money, without a budget. We know today that over the past 14 years the national budgets have increased, on average, more rapidly than the European Union budget, and now the Member States want the EU budget to decrease more rapidly then theirs. Moreover, President Barroso wants the social model to be the spearhead of our competitiveness. The International Monetary Fund tells us that the austerity policy that we are implementing is counterproductive. Day after day, we ask the Member States to carry out structural reforms. The first of these involves investment in human capital. I do not like that expression but it is what it says. Our greatest asset is the quality of our men and women. In that regard, in the next budget, if we do not succeed in building a wall to consolidate social spending, allocating 25 % of cohesion policy funds to the European Social Fund, we will be on the wrong track and we will not be preparing the European Union to cope with the challenges that lie ahead. In the same spirit, we must defend the programme for the most deprived persons and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. Pervenche Berès,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

Mr President, I am going to speak on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the report by Ms Auconie on a proposal to support European Social Entrepreneurship Funds. Last week, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, in an excellent conference organised by Commissioner Andor, emphasised that the European social model was an element of EU competitiveness and that social entrepreneurship clearly formed part of this. The proposal we have on the table is therefore welcome. However, I think that we must ensure – and that was the subject matter of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL) – that, through these social entrepreneurship funds, we do not create new niches in financial markets. I have to say that, from this point of view, we have two concerns. We had asked in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that the issue of social housing be treated specifically, and I think that that would have been valuable. Finally, I have to say that the response from the Commissioner representing Commissioner Barnier on the establishment of such funds in tax havens is, in my view, problematic, as, once again, it is not a question of creating new niches or nouveaux riches but of fostering a new, highly promising sector, that of the social market economy, through social entrepreneurship.

Mr President, Mr Hökmark, have you read the Treaty on European Union? It does not talk about a market economy, but about a social market economy. Of all the Union’s values, you only mentioned values and democracy. However, the latter must be enshrined in its social dimension, in social protection, in social dialogue and in collective bargaining, which you clearly seem to be completely ignoring. When you talk about monopolies, are you also thinking about the private monopolies that can bring countries to their knees, such as Goldman Sachs in Greece? When you talk about the internal market, do you have an overall vision of the internal market, a vision of the internal market that we need, that is to say, an internal market that also comprises fiscal and social harmonisation? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, we already had the opportunity to address this issue in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on Monday evening. I would like to make several comments. The first is that, in these country-specific recommendations that you have just made, we basically believe that the fundamental question that should be settled, were all these recommendations to be implemented, is that of macro-economic imbalances within the Union. When you examine this jigsaw of recommendations, you wonder whether we really do have all the tools we need to correct these macro-economic imbalances, whether, in particular, we can make the management of the euro area as a whole as effective as we would like it to be. Then, when I look at the specific recommendations that you have made for France, a country with which I am well acquainted, I am struck by the fact that at no time did you say that these recommendations had been made on the basis of a document submitted to you by a government since defeated in the elections. In this document, you are acting on the results of five years of Presidency by Nicolas Sarkozy. You say that, over five years, France lost 19.4% of its external competitiveness. The French people’s response to that is to say that they would like VAT to be revised, the pension reform to be revised and the minimum wage boosted. However, you say precisely the opposite in the recommendations that you make to this country. That raises an issue of democracy. Mr Hughes has already said this in the name of my group, but I shall say it again in this particular instance. We shall not succeed collectively if, in the Member States, we feel that there is a diktat drawn up in Brussels which ignores the political realities of our countries. You must answer this question. In this Parliament, as you know, we are all in favour of integration, of greater strength together at a European level, because we know that only together shall we be able to recover. However, if you do this against the people, against their political choices, we shall go to the wall. You must answer this question, Commissioner. Pervenche Berès,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the European Parliament wanted to organise this debate based on the employment package that you have placed on the Commission’s table and which we feel it is important to talk about here today, in plenary, at a time when the European Council may well mention a growth initiative, alongside other weighty matters which will be on its work table. With regard to that growth initiative, we think that your voice – which says that this growth must create jobs – should be strong, hence the importance of this debate that we are organising today. When we look at the expectations of Europeans, at the time when the unemployment rate is approaching an historic record, it is not so much stabilising financial markets, but keeping or finding a job that concerns them more than anything. It is this expectation that we must respond to, especially when it comes to the youngest citizens. This hope bumps up against the realities of a social situation that is intensifying by the day. How, indeed, can we fail to foresee the spectre of a lost generation when we know that 5.6 million young people are unemployed, that one young European out of five is looking for work and that the situation may not improve before 2016, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The European Commission repeats that it will take some time before guidelines produce effects in terms of job creation. However, for this to happen, the guidelines must be the right ones. It is striking to see that in the national reform programmes that the Member States have sent to the Commission, ultimately, their commitment to present their national employment plans has not really been followed up with results. Many have not implemented this proposal. I would like to retain two proposals from this employment package that you have put on the table that we think are right at the heart of the discussion that we need to have. Firstly, the taboo that you have ended when it comes to the minimum wage. You said that the minimum wage is an important element in the debate for combating poverty and social exclusion, for combating social dumping, and for putting forward the question of aggregate demand, of stimulating internal demand. It is a major topic if we wish to solve the problems of internal imbalances within the European Union. Next, there is a second proposal that you seem to support, for which you know that Parliament will give you its backing, and that is this idea of a Youth Guarantee, which means that no young person would be without employment, education or training after four months in the labour market. This is a major proposal. If we want to commit to specific proposals that go beyond mere words, we must move forward on this in the coming months in terms of financial perspectives and the conclusions of the next European Council, and we will be by your side to do this. Thank you, Commissioner, for the process into which, together, we will be able to breathe life so that we may correct a strategy which, for too long, has been one of austerity and which is leading us towards disaster. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 – (FR)
 Mr President, Ms Vestager, Mr Rehn, with these two reports, I think the important message that Parliament can bring to your work is that we must begin to improve consistency, since we can plainly see that the crisis we are sinking into, or have already sunk into, requires us to be perhaps a little more consistent. We cannot demand a lot from certain Member States and, at the same time, give nothing back, and we cannot wait until the end of the whole affair to reward them for their efforts. It is entirely a matter of governance – modern, intelligent governance adapted to the reality and severity of the crisis facing us. To achieve this consistency, when we draw up our economic policies, we must bear in mind everything we have learnt and everything we know about the extent of the macro-economic imbalances and the need to correct them. That means that the policies introduced must be evaluated, in terms of timing and criteria, according to how well they address these macro-economic imbalances. Secondly, Ms Vestager, the banking union question will clearly be at the heart of the discussions at the European Council on 28 and 29 June. The message I think this Parliament can give there, particularly with Ms Ferreira’s report, is one of balance. There must be a balance between a new approach in the Council debate to the challenges of growth, of which we are one of the main axes in Ms Ferreira’s report – which I hope will be given considerable support by this Chamber – and managing the debt issue. This balance between the way the debt question is addressed and the need for real growth – not merely internal market liberalisation but, above all, growth aiming at the long term and at investment – will at last enable us to give Europeans new hope. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Ms Vestager, Commissioner, when discussing a proposal on financial regulation, in a very classical way, two arguments are put forward. The first is that it is only possible to act on the largest possible scale, if possible on a global scale, and that any descent to a lower level would lead to a risk of unfair competition. The second argument is to say, ‘Oh, no, but certain products, which are safe, have to be excluded’. I would simply remind our fellow Members of the commitments made by the European Union, in particular through the members participating in the G20, who, in London, in April 2009, said, ‘We have decided that all financial institutions, markets and products of systemic importance should be subject to an appropriate level of regulation and supervision’. It seems to me that the taxation of financial transactions must also, under these conditions, cover undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and pension funds, that the level of intervention at which we will be able to launch this proposal will be the correct level of intervention, and that the issue of risks must be assessed on a global scale and not simply always to protect them.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs wanted to ask this question, and it did not know at the time that, on the very day on which we were to debate it, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) would bring out global youth unemployment figures, with 75 million young people unemployed and a red card for the European Union, within which 7.5 million young people between the ages of 15 and 24 are currently neither in a job nor in education or training. The European Union comes bottom of the class worldwide. Yet, when I look at the challenges facing the European Union, throughout the world, here and elsewhere, all day long, we say that Europe must meet the challenge of innovation, that it is innovation, that it is – a phrase I do not like – our human capital which will enable us to win the battle of globalisation. Yet, if that is the diagnosis we are making, how can we leave outside the labour market and exclude an entire generation? It is the whole question of the social impact of this crisis, which is not taken into account, which is neglected, which is regarded as a secondary issue. We are taking a collective risk, the consequences of which we are already seeing in a number of countries. The European Commission therefore set up eight Action Teams in eight of our Member States – Italy, Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Latvia, Spain, Lithuania and Slovakia – so that the European Union could mobilise its actions and its teams in these countries in order to meet this challenge in particular. Our questions to you, Commissioner, are therefore as follows. What are your conclusions? What proposals are you making? Where do you stand on this? We will support you whenever useful proposals are made to address this issue. However, we cannot accept the fact that youth unemployment rose from 14.7% in 2008 to 22.1% in 2011 and that, in many of our countries – as we know – almost half of young people are outside the labour market. We need what we have defined together as the goals of the EU 2020 strategy, which, it seems to me, has not aged a bit from that point of view, to be followed by actions. Yet, in this strategy – need I remind you – we said that we wanted early school leaving to be reduced to 10% of young people. We said that 40% of 30-34 year-olds would be required to have a qualifying diploma. What is happening in this regard? The proposals are on the table. I have taken note of the conclusions of the Council of 11 May 2012 with regard to strengthening the creative potential and innovation of young people. There is an urgent need for the EU to work towards this end. When the European Parliament, in particular, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, has examined the report by Jutta Steinruck on the EU programme for social change and innovation, it will submit proposals to you to enable us to finance a Youth Guarantee so that young people, when they leave the school system or when they lose their job, are no more than four months without work, without a training proposal or without an apprenticeship proposal. Those are the elements we want to discuss with you, Commissioner. We are convinced that this issue is a challenge for this generation of young people, the objective being to prevent them from becoming the excluded of tomorrow. However, it is also a challenge for our entire society, for the benefit of which we must take action. Commissioner, I know that, in this regard, we can count on your vigilance and the fact that you are a force for bringing forward proposals. This is a good opportunity to debate these elements and to make forward-looking proposals. (Applause) Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since, at this European Council, we ought to be talking openly and putting all our cards on the table, it seems to me that the state of the euro area means we should be thinking about things in three stages: the short term being the urgency of the situation in Greece, the medium term being a strategy for growth and the long term our vision of the euro area and us ‘living together’. In the short term, for Greece, we should realise that all those who thought that Greece could have a smooth exit from the euro area are being totally unrealistic; we have no Great Wall of China to protect us should Greece leave the euro area. Although we should also recognise that, in the Greek situation, nothing will be resolved if we continue to implement the troika’s mandate, which the Greeks rejected today. If we do not think things through, then nothing will be possible; there will be no general framework for an economic recovery, no hope restored, no dialogue and no solidarity at European level, be it in Greece or at European level. Commissioner, as you know, Mr Hollande’s election offers a rare window of opportunity to raise these issues again under new conditions. I do not agree with Mr Ferber when he said that there is only one model in Europe, the German model. We are a union built on diversity. Therefore, grab this window of opportunity that you have been given to finally provide Europe with all the answers it needs. These answers include a growth strategy, but not just any growth strategy. It should look beyond the internal market to avoid the traps of negative integration. These solutions should also include a genuine industrial policy, enabling us to make the investments we need to make our Europe a sustainable Europe, where jobs are created, where the main waste is not this generation currently being squeezed out of the labour market. You must admit then, Commissioner, that the way in which pressure is currently being put on Greece to reorganise its administration, while nothing is being done to help it with its negotiations with Switzerland, to put an end to the tax evasion performed by the privileged few in this country, is a source of injustice that neither the Greeks nor the Europeans, nor the French, nor the British nor the Germans should accept.

We have already said that we believe that the conditions under which sovereign debt is financed must be rethought. This is one of the possibilities on the table, but I am not prejudging a discussion that should be had and which should help relieve the financing of sovereign debt in countries like Greece and beyond.

 Mr Mitchell, I believe that the notion of showing respect for those who show solidarity is the basis on which we can all live together at European level. I also think that, in the case of your country, significant efforts have been made that have allowed you to recover from the difficult situation in which you found yourselves, but the contributions of a country like Ireland to what is the euro area is an issue which raises many other things that need to be put on the table. I should like to take this opportunity to say a few words about whether or not we should have taken note of the phenomena of rising prices and building bubbles over recent years. I see that, in your country, they managed to create a property bubble without stopping it in time. This is exactly the type of situation that we need to prevent. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I know the rules of this House. However, I would simply like to inform all of my colleagues about the vote that has just taken place. This item was added to the agenda on Monday and, clearly, most of my colleagues in the various groups did not know what they were voting on. That is why I abstained on most of the items in this resolution. I think that we have real difficulty here in terms of our working method. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Rehn, Commissioner, the fact that you are taking part with us in this debate on employment rights in a Europe of open borders implies, I imagine, that you have something to say on the subject in addition to your role of listening to the speeches. I must tell you, Commissioner, that you and I are very different, because whereas I am a lay person, to hear you speak, I sometimes get the impression that you belong to some sect or church that preaches austerity as its dogma. As a lay person, I rely on evidence. When I look at the current situation in Spain – a country that has conscientiously followed the Stability and Growth Pact and implemented all the Commission’s prescriptions, even when President Zapatero was in power – six million people are unemployed in the country today. Then I ask you, Commissioner: are the employment rights that we are talking about only valid during untroubled times, and in times of crisis must the Troika go to Greece to impose an austerity plan that totally ignores the strength of our social model and the important role of industrial relations in helping us come through the economic crisis? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Commissioner, my point is that at the time, Mr Sarkozy and Ms Merkel wanted to divide the socialists by using Mr Zapatero as an example against other socialist examples. Clearly, this is not the issue. The issue is whether or not healthy public finances can be restored in a country with no growth. The issue is not whether the problem is with the regions or with central government: the issue is growth for job creation. Commissioner, do you think this recipe will succeed in Greece when basically, from the workers’ point of view and that of the Greek people themselves, what you are proposing is for investment plans to be implemented by large German companies, and that Greeks should take advantage of their freedom of movement. That is tantamount to an organised brain drain. Do you really think that is the right way? Do you not think that, at the end of the day, there comes a time when one needs to admit that there has been a mistake? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, you said you were, on balance, in favour of the mutualisation of debt. You must tell us the steps you have taken in this regard and, more importantly, whether you think this mutualisation is useful and necessary or whether you are perhaps reacting to the new proposal made by Eurex which, in reality, destroys the European Union’s internal capital markets, allows speculation against a Member State and further diminishes the prospect of mutualising debt. In addition, Mr Barroso, I would like to know whether you have been informed by the outgoing French Government of the conditions for assessing France’s National Reform Programme and its Stability and Convergence Programme this year, given this country’s electoral timetable. Finally, with regard to the decisions taken this morning by your college relating to what is known as the ‘employment package’, I wonder about the consequences for your neighbour, Mr Rehn, with regard to the austerity policies being put forward in his portfolio. I already know what the response will be: ‘first austerity, then jobs’. I am led to believe this is not the solution and that what we are seeing today in Greece or Spain tells us that another way must be possible, one based on a pact for growth, responsibility and governance. Therefore, Mr Barroso, can you assure us that you are combining your two pillars, your employment pillar and your economic pillar, in the service of European citizens and job creation?

 Mr President, as Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I and Mr De Castro, who chairs the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, wished to raise this topic again here in plenary, partly in the light of the initial declarations made on behalf of the whole College of Commissioners on 15 February, in which it was stated that the Commission intended to use its exclusive right of initiative to bring a proposal back to the negotiating table whereby this programme could be funded under the next financial framework. As you know, you will have Parliament’s full support for such an initiative; however, we are asking you to go further. We feel that this programme must not be held ransom to intergovernmental talks on the common agricultural policy, nor should we subject it too literally to European Court of Justice judgments without reclaiming the legislative initiative. We are therefore calling for this programme to be a genuine solidarity programme; in other words, it should not be a burden on the European Social Fund. Otherwise, as I have already said, we will be using the poor to organise solidarity for the poor. That is not what we need. Lastly Commissioner, I would like to draw your attention to another matter: many people in this Parliament do not support macro-economic conditionality – you will never have our support for that – but do support subject-related conditionality and concentration on specific subjects. One of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy is to combat poverty and social exclusion. This provides all the legitimate basis we need for funding aid to the most deprived out of the EU budget. We ask you to strive for this, and to try to bring on board the Member States that are dismissing this call. Instead of counting them on a list, why not persuade them, and use your exclusive right of initiative as a means of prodding them along? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Vice-President, may I ask you to deliver a message to our President, to thank him and congratulate him on his action at the European Council? I believe that he had a significant impact on the debates by posing the question that is key for European identity: both that of the European social model and that of the democratic legitimacy of the processes embarked upon. This European Council has seen the signing of a treaty when even a government that is one of the most fervent advocates of a ‘Merkozy’ strategy now finds itself in difficulty. In my view, neither Spain nor the Netherlands could reasonably apply this treaty. I have understood, though, that in parallel, suddenly, our leaders have apparently discovered that they must also talk of growth, but not in the same way, not with the same golden rules, but with soft rules. I must say to you that there will be no more growth if you only apply the rule of the internal market, which is just a rule of negative integration, whereas your conclusions turn their back on the balance that had been enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy. You are unravelling this strategy and rewriting it after less than two years. The destruction of the European social model will not bring about more growth. There will not be more growth while those who claim they want to protect it are undermining the foundations of European identity. There will be more growth if you think, first and foremost, about jobs, joint industrial strategies, a European energy community and specific combating of tax evasion, instead of waiting countless months before negotiating and denouncing the unilateral strategies of some Member States. There will be no growth without consistent commitments by the Member States when we negotiate the financial framework and the introduction of an own resource on the basis of Eurobonds and a tax on financial transactions.

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, I address this question to you because Parliament does not understand what is happening at the Council. In December, we adopted by a very large majority the Commission’s proposal to extend European Globalisation Adjustment Fund crisis measures. Now we see it has been completely blocked at the Council in an inconsistent move that we do not understand – for can we declare the crisis over? Can we really say that this fund has not been a useful reflection of the effects of this crisis on workers? Today, growth forecasts for European GDP are between 0.5% and 3%. Or is Mr Draghi mistaken when he cites these figures for future European growth? The Commission itself predicted an economic downturn of 0.3% across the European Union in its latest projections published in February, despite the fact that in November 2011, it was still expecting 0.5% growth in 2012. Where will the crisis end? The crisis facing those employed in industry threatens the very existence of European sentiment. It encourages scepticism towards the European Union. It causes us to turn our backs on the very essence of our peaceful coexistence and ignores the elements of social justice we could provide. Applications submitted under crisis-related criteria have only increased since this crisis has not gone away. I must tell you Mr President that within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we have had the opportunity to hear from Spanish and Lithuanian experts who told us how valuable this crisis mechanism was. Furthermore, I wish to bear witness here to the response of the German public authorities. The director of the European Social Fund group has testified to the exemplary nature of this mechanism in bringing about social innovation and enabling workers affected by this crisis to find a European answer to their problems. However, today, his government constitutes a majority in favour of blocking the extension of this mechanism. We do not understand this and ask you, on behalf of the Presidency of the European Union, to use all your power to break this deadlock. I believe those who consistently argue for more flexicurity. Flexibility certainly exists, with widespread redundancies – day after day, we see jobs disappearing. Provide a little bit of security, allow these workers to be given training, a transitional period as they adapt to the new situation they find themselves in. I am worried that if this is the position of the Council today on the extension of the crisis mechanism, what will happen tomorrow when, as part of the financial perspectives, we are to negotiate the extension of mechanisms to all farmers affected by free trade agreements? There comes a time when the Council must choose between real solidarity and fake solidarity. Today, we prefer evidence and we do not believe the time has come for happy announcements of growth that might one day lead to job creation, or for the abolition of one of the few tools at the European Union’s disposal to provide concrete help, support and solidarity to workers affected not only by globalisation but, above all, by the financial crisis. We are counting on you, Mr President. You must change the majority in the Council, including among those Member States that are today refusing this extension of the derogation, despite being exemplary users of these funds. Pervenche Berès,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Ms Vestager, Commissioner, this is the fifth year running that the Spring European Council is to be held in an atmosphere of crisis. This is the fifth European Council held in an atmosphere of crisis and where, clearly, the logic is that out of austerity will come growth. I think that it is clearly time to take stock and admit that what comes out of austerity is recession and not growth. However, we have come together today to talk of a document that the Commission is adding to the work of the European Council, which goes by the name of the Annual Growth Survey. You must admit that there is something not quite right here and that it is high time to change our approach. First of all, in the name of our institution, the European Parliament, let me just say that we in this House are in total denial of democracy, because what is going on? The Spring European Council is adopting guidelines which are then going to be imposed on the Member States to define their economic policy strategy. On what basis is the Spring European Council going to reach its decisions? The Commission is trying to make its contribution in a direction that does not suit us, and yet it is tabling a Community document entitled Annual Growth Survey. Meanwhile, the Council is going to draw up the Euro Plus Pact on the basis of a scribbled note written by Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy, and then endorsed by the other institutions. In a democracy, the way in which broad economic policy guidelines are drawn up is the foundation of the social pact. That is why we have been fighting for this Parliament to have a say in the matter. We intend to do this on the basis of what the Commission persists in calling an Annual Growth Survey – we are calling for this to become annual guidelines for growth. We are calling on the Commission to face up to reality. Will this Annual Growth Survey enable the potential contradictions between the Stability Pact and the Europe 2020 strategy to be ironed out? Both Mr Gauzès’ and Ms Cornelissen’s reports – I should like to thank our two fellow Members for the spirit of cooperation that has marked our work – invite you to walk on two feet and, if you want to walk on two feet, you may at times have to turn your back on austerity and the Stability Pact. Otherwise, we shall never manage to implement the Europe 2020 strategy. We are also calling for a balanced approach to economic situations. That means that, when there are imbalances within the European Union, you have to look at both deficits and surpluses. Ms Vestager, as I have already said, for us, the Euro Plus Pact is not a basis for negotiation. Madam, just look at the figures. Today, everybody in Europe is in difficulties. Have you seen the OECD’s figures for Germany’s growth prospects for 2012? 0.4%. That is proof enough that even the most virtuous economy in the European Union cannot withstand the situation of recession into which the policies of this five-year term are leading the euro area and the European Union as a whole. Furthermore, look at the way that you are managing the EU’s tools. The European Social Fund is being used for anything and everything. On the one hand, you would like it to be a tool to apply macro-economic sanctions and, on the other, when it comes to creating jobs for young people, you want to mobilise the European Social Fund. These contradictions must be resolved and, to do this, I suggest you look at the reports that this Assembly is offering you as the European Parliament’s contribution to the work of the Spring Council. I hope that, via our President when he comes to talk to you, these guidelines, whether in economic or employment matters, will improve your road map because, if they do not, democracy and the European people will find themselves in a jam. Pervenche Berès,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, you said that the European Parliament had agreed not to change the guidelines. So be it. However, we would like to see these guidelines implemented and, in our reports, we make a certain number of proposals to provide you with the means to monitor this implementation. In particular, I should like to mention one proposal, the proposal to work with the Member States on a budgetary heading which would allow us to ascertain the contribution of the Member States, for example, to realising the objectives of the 2020 strategy rather than towards military expenditure or whatever else. Ms Vestager, thank you for being here today. You have said that you will report on this debate and the work of this Parliament at the 21 February meeting of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN). This is precisely what we would like to see. It is in that spirit that we would like to advance European democracy and it is also in that spirit that on 27 and 28 February, we shall meet with representatives of all the national parliaments to ensure that, in this European Semester, there is also room for the democratic dimension to thrive. Finally, Ms Vestager, may I call on you to take into account in the same way, during this ECOFIN Council, the new impact assessment that the Commission is due to publish tomorrow on the assessment of the tax on financial transactions.

Mr President, we are going to vote on Mr Siekierski’s report. On behalf of all our fellow Members and, in particular, the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we would like to say that we are going to accept the two-year extension of the Food Distribution Programme for the Most Deprived Persons, on the basis of the agreement reached at the Council. Simply speaking, bearing in mind the political conditions under which this agreement was reached at the Council, we would like to obtain a statement from the Commission on its vision for the future of this programme. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, we must not forget, all the same, that this proposal goes against the adoption of a so-called ‘golden’ rule. This is good because this new treaty does not include a single provision in favour of growth and employment while, on the other hand, you have this declaration, which you have today been charged with putting in place. When you are looking for good ideas to encourage youth employment, I would invite you to turn your attention to Parliament’s work, since we have drafted a report on youth employment in which I think you will find some good proposals. As for the use of the Structural Funds, we are still being bombarded with contradictions which are sparking debate. On the one hand, we want to mobilise Structural Funds to offset the golden rule but, aside from that, we want to use them to sanction the Member States. The time will come when we will have to choose where our consistency lies. How can the European Union work when it is being pulled in two directions? Then, when we are discussing fundamental financial perspectives, President Barroso’s movement questions us. Does the European Union’s budget not need to have resources at its disposal that can be used, depending on the situation, to implement countercyclical measures? In this case, are the proposals you have made for the future Structural Funds programmes adapted to the crisis situation the EU is currently experiencing? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
),  
Blue-card question. 
– (FR)
 Madam President, I would like to ask Mr Fernandes if he regards being concerned about the consequences of pension reform which excludes workers from the entire compensation and income system as getting involved in politics – clearly, coming from his mouth, this seems to be a bad thing. Mr Gauzès, who, to my knowledge, belongs to the same group, took the view that it had to be taken into account and that the government as shareholder should perhaps be concerned about this situation. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Madam President, the European Parliament, with a very large majority, pronounced itself in favour of extending the crisis mechanism within the framework of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). It is something of a paradox that some Member States – whose representative and member of the Council is not present to hear this debate and our arguments – refuse to extend the derogation within the framework of the crisis mechanism at a time when the OECD notes that the European Union and, in particular, the euro area is in recession, and has corrected the growth forecasts for next year to 0.2%. Where is the end of the crisis? I put the question to the Council. The reality is that there is a blocking minority in the Council which thinks that, since we are in a crisis, it is no longer necessary to apply the fundamental rule of the European Union, which is that of solidarity. I call on the Council to hear Parliament’s message. We demand solidarity within the European Union. Madam President, I would like just one second to talk about Renault. There are some in this Chamber who say that this is all about electoral manoeuvring. I call on the Commission to assume its responsibilities and to ensure that its right hand knows what its left hand is doing. I ask that, tomorrow, when it looks at how pension reform has been implemented in France, it takes into account the damage caused by Mr Bertrand and his pension reform and that it tells France that the disastrous effects of this pension reform must be corrected. Pervenche Berès,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, in tackling this report, Parliament is tackling the issue of democratic legitimacy in the context of economic policy. At a time when everyone is wondering about how economic policy will be handled and about the fate that the forthcoming Council meeting has in store for that policy for the member countries of the euro area, it is important for the European Parliament to express its opinion in order to establish what the democratic legitimacy of the debate on an economic policy coordinated at EU level might consist of. The European Commission has put forward the idea of a European semester in order to give direction to this debate before it takes place in the national parliaments. We believe that, as part of this European semester, we, the European Parliament, must be able to have our say with regard to the Annual Growth Survey that the European Commission is tabling as a key document for this debate. We believe that this document should be an economic policy-making document, which is why we are proposing that, in future, the Commission describe this document as what it is: not an annual growth survey, but an economic policy-making document aimed at sustainable growth. Because, otherwise, it is clear that economic policy coordination at Heads of State or Government level will go in an altogether different direction, that of a Euro Plus Pact, for example, or of who knows what other procedure they might invent in the future. No, we need a document from the Commission that gives direction to this debate, that incorporates the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and, of course, those of the Stability and Growth Pact. To ensure this, we also call for the European Parliament to be able to intervene straight away with quasi-codecision powers before the Spring European Council, and for the President of this institution, when he represents us at that Council, to be able to defend changes to this strategy, to this economic policy stance, on the basis of the mandate we shall give him. We also call for these powers to be recognised explicitly ascodecision powers in the future. Throughout this process, we believe that our cooperation with the national parliaments really must help to create this democratic legitimacy. This means that in February, before the Spring European Council, we must organise this meeting with the national parliaments in order to discuss what this economic policy stance will consist of. We must do so on the basis of what has already taken place and what is set to take place within this Parliament not only on the initiative of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, but also in cooperation with other committees, such as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. Then, once the European Council is over, we must organise a further debate, perhaps on a smaller scale, when the national parliaments themselves will have to ratify their national reform programmes. Lastly, we believe that this Parliament will clearly have to adapt to this new situation if it wants to be involved in this debate to establish the democratic legitimacy of the entire process. To ensure this, we know that we will have to adapt our ways of working, our practices to what is currently being implemented by both the Council and the Commission, and we state in this report that we are ready to do so. Lastly, with regard to the still uncertain prospect of a possible Treaty reform, we would make the following strong point: under the Treaty of Lisbon, this Parliament has rights that make it a key player in any Treaty reform process. We have already been consulted once on the reform of the Treaty when the European Stability Mechanism was implemented, and at that time we authorised this reform without an agreement. Given the issues that could potentially be discussed, we confirm today that we shall not allow such a reform to take place without an agreement. Discussions will have to be held with Parliament on both the time frame and the content of such a reform. It cannot simply be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union, so that economic policy is turned into a form of competition policy. We want this mandate to be a mandate for laying the foundations of EU economic policy, a solidarity and growth policy that is based on democratic legitimacy. As for the issue of how to achieve this, we also call for this Parliament to be involved, alongside the national parliaments, by means of an agreement. Democratic legitimacy is what gives the European Union added value. Pervenche Berès,  
rapporteur. 
− (FR)
 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should first like to respond to Ms Ford, who has abandoned us. It is surprising to see an MEP from the United Kingdom express concern about the fact that a parliament is worried about democratic legitimacy. That does not match the impression I have of democracy as seen from the United Kingdom. I also wish to say to her that we are so insistent that the European Parliament should have the power of codecision when defining its economic policy guidelines precisely because we believe that, budgetary consolidation aside, this is one of the ways of ensuring that our concerns with regard to growth and with regard to funding for innovation, research and investment needs in industry are taken into account. President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to thank you for your insistence on the Community method, and to say to you that, while the Member States are, of course, sovereign powers, it is important that we also learn the lessons of this crisis. One of the lessons of this crisis is that ex-ante coordination of Member States’ economic policies has not worked well enough. To ensure that it does work well, and on an acceptable, democratic basis, in accordance with what the European institution stands for, I invite you, and your successors, on behalf of the Danish Presidency, to take full account of the observations that this Parliament will make on the 2012 Annual Growth Survey. Commissioner, you said that you did not want this exercise to be described as technocratic. It is up to us alone to make it a political economic-policy making exercise. I believe that this report contributes to this aim and I hope, Commissioner, that you will support us in improving the procedure and in ensuring that the Council genuinely takes account of the observations that this European Parliament will make. We shall come to the February part-session with observations on the content so that, together, we are more effective. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Vice-President Rehn, I think that you heard Mr Juncker when he talked about how the European semester should become a political tool. To that end, the founding act of the discussion – which is at least what we think you called the Annual Growth Survey – must become annual guidelines for sustainable growth. You have the chance, this time, to change it before next time, so do it. If this European semester is to be a debate about political guidelines, there will then be no economic government without Parliament involved, having its say, creating discussion around these political and economic guidelines. You must realise that, in 2012, this European Parliament might propose amendments to this Annual Growth Review, which would be debated at the European Council. That is what this Parliament is proposing. I hope that you can take it into account, because then you will be keeping democracy and political debate alive and national parliaments and the European Parliament will be involved in what must be genuine governance of the euro area and of the Union. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Daerden, for his excellent work. Commissioner, you fought and managed to get the objective of combating poverty included in the Europe 2020 strategy. Our current fear is that, with austerity plans, this essential objective may be overlooked. The conclusion of the agreement on the European food aid programme has left a nasty taste in my mouth as I fear that France and Germany have signed up to abandoning it definitively after 2014. That is not the thrust of the Europe 2020 strategy. We have a sovereign debt crisis and yet nothing should make us deviate from this strategy, as it is our road map, the one that we set for ourselves. In the fight against poverty, we must, in the platform that you have introduced, work on more precise indicators, as we still lack the ability to intervene in a targeted fashion with quantified objectives. This would allow us to benefit from intervention from the European Social Fund, in particular, targeted precisely at real trends in poverty. Then we would like the issue of minimum income to be raised clearly. We are calling for a consultation by the European Commission on a legal proposal of this nature. That, Commissioner, is your responsibility. We are also calling for the issue of accessibility to social services of general interest to be maintained. Finally, we are calling for the horizontal Anti-discrimination Directive to see the light of day. This is also crucial if this platform for combating poverty and social exclusion is to be a success. Pervenche Berès,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, we welcome the fact that the Commission’s draft budget has been restored in the areas that concern the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. The Commissioner was good enough to welcome this, and we feel this is important overall. This is the first budget since 14 January 2011, and hence the first since the Arab democratic revolution began. We welcome and back the European Training Foundation’s initiative to secure EU budget funding to help support industrial relations and the development of the labour market, in the context of the dialogue we will be entering into with these southern Mediterranean partner countries. Unfortunately, this is not the first budget of this economic crisis we are going through. We therefore feel that all initiatives that can be undertaken to support youth employment, especially through the pilot project we have begun, and the ‘Your first EURES job’ project for young people, are absolutely vital; and we hope that when the budget conciliation takes place, the budget for this project will be kept at the figure we voted for. Pervenche Berès,

 Madam President, Mr Dominik, Commissioner, Parliament’s intention in tabling this oral question was to contribute to a debate that we feel is absolutely crucial. When the Commission took the initiative to present this European Semester proposal, the idea was that economic governance should include a period of time for establishing European guidelines. This is, to some extent, a step towards the creation of this infamous economic government. We, the European Parliament, are worried about the fact that there might be an economic government without an economic ‘parliament’. We would like to hear your assessment of the democratic legitimacy of this European Semester. How does democratic debate on this European Semester fit in? Political debate on economic policy guidelines is the foundation of every democracy. If you raise the level at which economic policy guidelines are decided, then you must pay heed to the democratic debate and deliberation on those guidelines. That is what the European Parliament is trying to ensure and what we are challenging you on. I note that, during the European Council on Sunday, you brought up the European Semester and you managed to do so without once mentioning the European Parliament, or even, I have to say, the national parliaments. Do you think that that is acceptable? Similarly, the Commission pledged to present its next Annual Growth Survey in December. Very well. So be it. Why, then, have you not discussed it with us? Where is the democratic debate on this issue? When you table your new proposal, which assessment of the cycle that has just ended will you base it on? How are you incorporating the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives in your analysis of this European Semester? Furthermore, as Ms Bowles said – and I fully support her on this and on many other points in this matter – we are asking you to be completely transparent with regard to the amendments that you make to the country-specific recommendations after discussing them with the Member States. Otherwise, this exercise has no legitimacy and is meaningless. When you adopt the Annual Growth Survey, how much importance do you really attach to that document? Is it just a bureaucratic document to keep the European Parliament happy, or is it a genuine policy document? Unless we are mistaken, and your real objective is the Euro Plus Pact. We want some explanations on this point, Commissioner. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, with this report – and I should like to congratulate our rapporteur, Ms Bastos – we wanted to initiate dialogue with the European Commission. Your colleague, Ms Damanaki, reiterated on your behalf the proposals that you are making regarding the use of the European Social Fund (ESF), to ensure that 25% is dedicated to training and to the use of the ESF in every project. However, we are concerned about the idea that, at this time of crisis, which we have been debating all day long, we might penalise countries that are finding it difficult to meet the Stability and Growth Pact criteria by reducing the structural funds, particularly the European Social Fund. Europe will not have the means to rise to the challenge it faces, namely, overcoming the crisis and implementing the Europe 2020 strategy – for which the objectives of job creation and combating social exclusion are absolutely paramount – in this way. If we wish to successfully rise to this challenge, the issue of training, as Ms Bastos has suggested to us, is vital. That being the case, we also need to ensure that the creation of new types of jobs does not make us lose sight of one of the pillars of European democracy, namely, the functioning of social dialogue. We do not believe that it is necessary to depart from this idea of collective agreements, which have ensured the success of social democracy in Europe. Moreover, through your colleague, Commissioner, you also pointed out that the European Job Mobility Portal, EURES, is a precious asset when it comes to the free movement of persons throughout Europe. I believe that together, we need to take a fresh look at this matter so as to ensure the effective operation of this tool. I have heard it said, here and there, that we might be able to improve its functioning, and I would like it if we could work towards this together with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, like many who have spoken before me, I think that Ms Rühle’s report is a good one. Public procurement is an instrument with which public authorities can set an example. Consequently, this idea that the criterion of the most economically advantageous offer should replace that of the lowest price is somewhat in line with our demand at European level for the criterion of GNP no longer to be the only indicator. We are on the right track. However, if you are looking for ways of going further, you could also take the step of proposing bonuses and penalties for companies that fail to meet the requirements in terms of sustainable and quality goods and services when implementing these public procurement contracts. Furthermore, as you and many others have said, we want to be able to facilitate access for operators in the social economy through this review of public procurement rules at EU level. I should like to raise a third point, which I believe is absolutely crucial, namely, the issue of subcontracting. As you know, Commissioner, large worksites throughout the world are a real disgrace in terms of their compliance with social legislation. We cannot bury our heads in the sand and use competition or the risk of the Chinese winning contracts as an excuse. We need to make these contracts an example of excellence in social terms. This means that you have to review the chain of responsibility issue. Tenderers who win public contracts must shoulder their responsibilities, and that includes going and supervising letterbox companies that encourage modern-day slavery and which we cannot tolerate within the European Union. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, you are going to make new proposals on economic governance in competition with, or head-to-head with, the President of the European Council. At least this contribution has added value, though. Economic governance will not improve without democratic oversight, without democratic legitimacy. Do not forget that, at EU level, what goes on in the Council must be overseen by this House and that the ordinary legislative procedure ought perhaps to be considered within the scope of the European Semester. Moving on, I should like, if I may, to put some questions to you as the representative of your President, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso. Mr Barroso came here to deliver a speech to us on the State of the Union, which he hailed as probably one of his greatest speeches. Then, three days later, having denounced the role of the G20, he accepted instructions from a capital to apply macro-economic conditionality to the Structural Funds. Put simply, the regions, the poor and workers are being made to pay for what the capitals have been unable to implement. Do you consider that to be an example of good European governance? On 21 July, when you and the Heads of State or Government adopted the second bailout plan for Greece, you said that we needed a pillar to support economic activity, and you used the Structural Funds for that purpose. Why is it, then, that what was legitimate on 21 July has become an absurdity in your proposal on the Structural Funds? That is not good governance.  (Applause) Stéphane Le Foll  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, we have all gathered this morning to express our anger. There may be legal reasons for the decision that has been taken, but it makes no political sense. Indeed, it is politically indefensible, in the current crisis and under the current conditions, to reduce the food aid budget as you are proposing to do – aid that goes to our most deprived citizens. You cannot leave it there. You cannot. All the political groups in Parliament are calling on you to make the right decisions. We are not talking about EUR 500 million as opposed to EUR 100 million. We are talking about at least maintaining existing levels of food aid. Demand is growing in every country. Let me say a few words on the subject of agriculture. Once again, my comments are directed at the Commission. The question of agricultural stocks is not the same as it was 10, 15 or 20 years ago, when intervention stocks left us with huge surpluses. In the current European situation, we need a policy on food security stocks, both for Europe and for the rest of the world. I say this in the light of starvation levels around the world and the current situation in Europe. These are two very clear signals. You must reinstate a decent budget that will allow us to address this problem. In terms of agricultural policy, the Commission now needs to put forward clear proposals that will allow the creation of what we are calling food security stocks. The reality is that access to food is a major problem at the dawn of the 21st century, both in Europe and in the rest of the world. This morning, this House is sending you a very clear message. I hope that you are up to this massive challenge. Stéphane Le Foll,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Dess, Mr Dantin was cut off, but he was going to explain that the global food challenge is important, and it is important. As has already been said, this report, together with previous reports and the Commission’s communication, seeks to demonstrate that Europe’s aim is to have a common agricultural policy that guarantees food security in Europe and contributes to global food security. That entails political commitments on market regulation, which is what is under discussion today. We too will have to push for this in our debates at EU level. At a time when there are plans to eliminate Europe’s food security programme, we need to remember that food security is still a matter of solidarity and is still extremely topical in Europe: almost 30 million Europeans are currently suffering from malnutrition. Let us not lose sight of that fact. Essentially, this report sets out the broad thrust: the greening of agricultural policy. Of course farming needs to take a positive approach to environmental issues. In particular, it needs to focus on the European element and ensure that it is factored in by incorporating environmental issues into the first pillar. Another important point is that this compromise is the result of lengthy negotiations, in which I have always been involved, on the question of graduated support. At long last, support will be allocated in accordance with two criteria: employment – I believe that agricultural policy needs to allow for the notion of providing employment – and, of course, the production of public goods. This approach is better than continuing the debate on aid ceilings and never coming up with any solutions. I am making the point this afternoon because it is my honest opinion. Let me conclude by saying that this report and Parliament’s commitment are pointless unless the agriculture budget remains at its current level. That is my response to the comments made by the Commissioner and the President of the Commission on the second pillar. We cannot accept a budget cut. Stéphane Le Foll,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I fully agree with the remark that Mairead McGuinness has just made on the fact that there is a fundamental link between the issues of food and agriculture. The issue we are addressing is rising food prices and the consequences that may have for a certain number of populations around the globe, as well as in Europe. I would first like to make the following observation. The trend towards ever higher agricultural and commodities prices is, in my view, a long-term trend, which will continue for three main reasons: first, world demographic trends and a rising world population; second, the fact that, with global warming, we are experiencing problematic weather hazards such as drought and floods; third, because the world is also developing. With new emerging economies consumption levels are increasing. Therefore, the tight situation on agricultural markets and agricultural commodities is a trend that is on the increase. It is aggravated by price volatility, and price volatility is a consequence of the financialisation of the global economy. This is what we should be addressing if we want to resolve the agricultural issue and the food issue. To do this – what the Commissioner said is important – there are two elements: yes, there needs to be transparency on stocks, but we also need a public policy on stocks in Europe and stock management at a global level, especially at the level of the United Nations. Secondly, regulation of the financial markets and market speculation is essential, in particular by ensuring that there is no longer any connection between the speculative volume and the physical quantities exchanged on the markets. As regards food, it is unacceptable that speculators speculate without taking account of the consequences this may have for world food and humanity. This leads me to draw two major conclusions. Firstly, we need a strong European policy and to strategically reassert Europe’s commitment to being a global player in the food and agricultural sectors. Secondly, we need to change our development policy to ensure that globally – and Europe is a global player – we once again invest in agriculture, because we need agriculture to feed the world. (Applause) Stéphane Le Foll,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, I should like to speak without going back over the debate we have had up to now. We debated a 2011 budget under the constraints with which we are familiar, that is, those of a deep crisis affecting all of Europe with public deficits at national level which could lead to two hypotheses. Either these public deficits at national level pose a constraint on the European deficit, or these deficits at national level must give a new direction and a new lease of life at the level of Europe. That is the question. I am asking you, Commissioner, to try, above all, when we debate the budgetary review, when we are about to start to talk about the budgetary perspectives for post-2013, not to remain completely absorbed by this context of crisis, unless you are going to tell me and tell all European citizens that, in effect, Europe will remain in the crisis for a long time. Our entire problem really concerns how to manage the crisis and reduce our deficits and debt, and also how to prepare for extricating ourselves from the crisis. That is where the question of the budget comes in. We can only get out of the crisis, and Joseph Daul made this point just now, if the European budget, on account of being European, is able to provide us with the resources to recover what we are lacking today; that is growth, job creation, innovation, research. That is what is at stake and it is in these terms that we should debate the budget and not do what we are too often prone to do, that is, constantly harp on about the issue of the crisis and the issue of deficits, and the Council really excels at that. I observed that at Deauville, the German Chancellor and the French President even announced in anticipation a reform of the treaties, without having had any kind of discussion with Mr Van Rompuy, so as to punish all those States which failed to respect budgetary discipline in the future. That is where we have got to in the Council today, while Parliament is only asking for one thing, in particular of the Commission, and that is to try to move the European project forward, which happens through the budget. So, you have noted a certain number of issues on which we are entirely in agreement. There is a need for greater flexibility. Evidently, we must manage together to find the capacity to have a much more flexible budget because it is a necessity; Europe’s capacity for reaction is at stake. It is also, of course, a question of setting priorities and organising the European budget efficiently. We are all doubtless in agreement that it is a necessity. However, where we must be clear with one another is on the need for a timetable, on the need for us to set our objectives together. Commissioner, we cannot leave matters as empty words and promises, written texts which are extremely interesting and with which I agree almost 100%. Now we are going to have to get down to the practical matters and, in particular, to an essential issue that we have been skirting round, that of own resources. What do we need to do in order to have own resources tomorrow for Europe, or rather for all the citizens of Europe, so that we are all put back on the path to growth and on an even firmer path for the Europe of tomorrow to take? We await your ambitious proposals, Commissioner. Stéphane Le Foll  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I too would like to welcome the work done by the rapporteur, Mr Bové, to welcome the Commissioner, and also to welcome the speech by Mr Dess, who spoke before me, on the objectives of this report. I feel it is very important to remember that, in this debate, we have to solve a problem linked to the volatility of agricultural prices and, above all, to the fact that, when prices rise, the increase is very quickly passed on to the distribution sector, but when they fall at production level, there is no knock-on effect for consumers. Therefore, there is clearly a problem with the way in which the chain is organised; there is clearly a problem with the way in which so-called added value is distributed within it. I believe that Mr Bové’s report offers ideas, in several areas, that we must take further – and here I am really addressing the Commission – in order to try and emerge from this fundamentally negative spiral. The first, of course, is to organise the chain and the balance of power within it. What proposals are we making to ensure that producers who work together and are organised carry more weight within the chain in order to negotiate? That is the question you asked, Commissioner, with regard to interprofessions, but it is also a question that relates to the contractual basis that is going to be implemented. I call for this contractual basis to have a European framework – a point made in the report. We cannot let each country solve this problem. There has to be a European framework. It must be flexible, but it must exist. This proposal, this course of action, is inextricably linked as far as I am concerned. Secondly, of course, there is the issue of price transparency. Here, I am in favour of creating this observatory, which we absolutely must have so that consumers can be kept informed of price trends. Those are the points I wished to make. I support the proposals that have been made and I hope, as Mr Dess said, that the rapporteur’s proposals receive the support of the majority. Stéphane Le Foll  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I understand that you had a short and happy night. I thank the Commissioner for listening throughout this debate and I would like to congratulate Mr Lyon on the work he has carried out in connection with the report he is presenting this morning. What is the aim here? To make people realise that, in today’s world, agriculture, food and the environment are challenges for the whole of Europe. That is the aim. What do we mean by that? Rejecting the renationalisation of the CAP and increasing cofinancing, that is the first point. Maintaining an agricultural budget that is a match for these challenges and this major issue of food security, that is the second point. Ensuring that agriculture can provide the public goods demanded by society, that is the third element. The fourth element is regulating and preventing market volatility, which I believe is essential. We must return to this topic and we need to go a little further still. My final point concerns the first and the second pillar. I warn all those who defend this structure – and they are perhaps right – that, ultimately, within the framework of the budgetary discussion, there is a danger of the first pillar being reduced significantly, with everything being transferred to the second pillar, itself cofinanced, which would contradict the objective we have set of avoiding the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy. I am saying that this morning because this is the debate we are holding. Commissioner, I would like to finish with a simple idea. The CAP was created at the same time as the European Economic Community. We are now in the European Union. I really feel that we ought to have a major policy … (The President cut off the speaker) Stéphane Le Foll,

 Mr President, it therefore falls to us to close these debates this evening, and it is already late. I would like, first of all, to excuse the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr De Castro, who is unable to be here with us this evening for reasons that you know. Like other Members of this House, he has been unable to leave his country to come and participate in our debates in Strasbourg. The issue with which we are concerned results from the general crisis being experienced by the entire agricultural sector. As we know today, we are experiencing a crisis and, above all, seeing a fall in prices and agricultural revenues that is affecting cereal producers, livestock producers, whether pork or beef producers, and also – and I say this on behalf of Mr De Castro – olive oil producers, and which is hitting and has hit dairy producers extremely hard. Faced with this crisis and this price fall, it goes without saying that Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wishes to find out from the Commission what we can do right now and in the future to escape this crisis and, above all, what measures could be adopted in the coming months to support farmers and to ensure that the agricultural markets are less volatile. The first question that I would like to ask the Commissioner is more specifically about the dairy crisis: what is the situation with regard to the measures adopted by Parliament and the Council concerning this dairy crisis and, in particular, to the application of the famous EUR 300 million milk fund that had been agreed? That is the first question because I think that, if we are going to take legislative decisions, then we must know how they are being applied. As I was saying, all types of production are currently being hit by a price fall and a deep crisis in the markets. That brings us to a question and to seek answers on what we might call market regulation and the way in which we can limit this infamous price volatility. Nobody complains when prices are rising, especially not farmers. It is European consumers who fear agricultural price rises, which limit their purchasing power and impact on their ability to buy agricultural products. It is when prices are low and when they are falling for long periods that producers are penalised in terms of their incomes and, above all, and most seriously for European agriculture, in terms of their abilities to invest and to prepare for the future. Agriculture is a hard industry; the investments are substantial and it takes a long time to obtain a return on those investments. We need to stabilise prices. Commissioner, the question from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its Chair, Mr De Castro, is composed of two points. Firstly, you have announced a number of dairy-related measures to be implemented before the end of the year. This is important. Can you give us some details of these? Secondly, there are specific measures that need to be taken on all the markets, not just dairy. Finally, the question that we wished to ask you is how the Commission plans to anticipate and prevent these price falls in the medium term. What market regulation mechanism can be used to limit sudden increases and, above all, sudden price falls? What work is the Commission currently doing and how does it view this issue? Those are the three elements that I wished to mention: the milk fund, perspectives on the dairy crisis and, more generally, the way in which the Commission intends to deal with this issue of price volatility and price falls. Stéphane Le Foll,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, the report I am presenting to Parliament sets out to explain that the agricultural sector has a place and a role to play in the fight against global warming. This week, nature has reminded us – this time in the shape of volcanoes – that it can have a major impact on human activities and on the climate. However, this means that, in spite of everything, human beings and Europe in particular must take responsibility for combating what we refer to as global warming. My report aims to show that the agricultural sector can continue to reduce both its carbon emissions and its fossil fuel consumption and, above all, at the same time, can make a very active contribution to carbon fixation so that, at world level, we can achieve lower carbon emissions and ensure that a greater proportion of carbon is stored and captured. The report attempts to illustrate the need for agriculture to move away from a compartmentalised approach, which consists of introducing a new directive on soil, water, pesticides and so on, whenever there is a problem, towards trying to tackle the agricultural issue in a more comprehensive and systematic way. Within this type of approach, we will need to identify avenues which ensure, as I mentioned earlier, that the agricultural sector not only reduces its energy consumption but, at the same time, actively participates in carbon fixation. This role relates, in particular, to photosynthesis and biomass, and especially to an area that is close to my heart, which is soil and the capacity of European soils to store organic carbon. I believe that this approach, which I discuss in this report and which I hope will be endorsed during the vote that is due to take place in the Brussels part-session, will enable agriculture in Europe to enter a new phase of sustainability and to make the transition to a more environmentally aware state which would place it ahead of a number of other continents and other agricultural systems. In doing so, it would have a more positive impact both economically and environmentally and, as a result, a more positive impact in social terms. This report deals, therefore, with the specific issue of agriculture in relation to the fight against global warming, but it also claims – in any case I hope it does – to explore other ways of sustaining, in particular, the debate that will be taking place on the future of agricultural policy post-2013. I am addressing the Commission; I will be addressing the agricultural committees, as I have frequently done, and I will also be addressing the various ministers when I have the opportunity. I believe we need to change direction. The 2013 CAP needs to be ambitious. It must be based on goals that will help citizens to understand why we need a common agricultural policy. We need a common agricultural policy because Europe’s agricultural community needs both to ensure food security and to embark on the path of sustainability. In any case, this is the direction I propose in my report and the one in which I hope a large majority of Parliament will follow me. Stéphane Le Foll  (S&amp;D

Madam President, President Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, I would like first of all to say that, as far as the 2020 strategy is concerned, everyone agrees on the targets. However, the problem our continent has today is that it is emerging from a serious crisis, the characteristics of that being that we have extremely weak, or even negative, growth globally. This therefore requires political awareness and, for me, that has two goals. Firstly, that of knowing how we organise ourselves politically. In the positions you hold, you have two major responsibilities: to encourage coordination of economic policies – this is absolutely vital – and to set targets with tools to achieve them. This brings me on to the second goal, which I believe is essential, and, at the same time, it will be a question. To achieve goals in public policy, a budget is needed. Today, Europe is confronted with this dilemma: the Member States have significant deficits and the more significant their deficits, the less they will throw in Europe’s common pot. Therefore, we are less able to revive our growth. How do we solve this dilemma? This is the question I put to you. It depends on two elements. Firstly, what are the guidelines that you will defend when discussing the budgetary perspectives with the Member States? Secondly, are you able to move towards innovations that will allow the European Investment Bank and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development alike to assume much greater responsibility and – why not? – to enable Europe to borrow to finance this necessity, which is the growth of tomorrow?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall certainly repeat things which have already been said and welcome, in any case, the result of the Irish vote on the Treaty of Lisbon. I should simply like to draw the attention of the Members remaining in the House to the reasons for the change, because we are satisfied with the ‘yes’ but, a year ago, it was a ‘no’. What has changed? The text? Very little. The context? A lot. That is what matters. We can discuss institutional questions here. What the citizens are waiting for are political answers from Europe. That, to my mind, is the analysis that we need to make of this double vote. There is not just one vote, there are two. The ‘no’ to start with and then the ‘yes’. The Irish said that they needed Europe in the crisis and this needs to be heavily emphasised, because they are asking Europe to protect them and that is important. I shall repeat what numerous members have said. I think that we need to proceed quickly now. So we are turning to the Swedish Presidency of the Council and we are turning to the Commission. If we want to reply to the demand by the people of Ireland, we need to give concrete replies. The economic crisis: is Europe capable of stimulating growth on a European scale? The social crisis: is Europe capable of having an employment policy? For me, these are the subjects at the heart of the debate and I am satisfied with another thing which the Treaty of Lisbon gives us and that is that Parliament will have enhanced powers and, in the political debate, I think that it has an essential role to play and that is to show that there are various options and to debate those options. However, now, if this is to be a democratic debate and if Europe is to manage to provide replies, we quickly need to designate a Commission and to ensure that the Czechs ratify as quickly as possible so that Europe can get back on the road to growth and hope. Stéphane Le Foll  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, I will be brief. I think that there are two parts to this debate. There is the immediate question of how we can extricate ourselves from this crisis. All measures, ranging from assistance for farmers to intervention measures, are necessary – in fact, absolutely necessary. We must endorse them and even call for them to be enlarged in scope. That is what we, together with several fellow Members, are proposing here in Parliament. Secondly, there is the structural question regarding the management of the dairy market, and this is where our views diverge from yours, Commissioner. You propose that we move in the direction of using contractual relations. I can tell you in advance that introducing contractual relations between industrial firms and farmers will, in the long term, result in those industries competing with each other, on a Europe-wide scale. In order to regulate a market, we need public regulation. There is no other solution. After this crisis, that is what the debate must be about. I think that, in this debate, we must respect all opinions and all options; I fear that we acted too quickly at the time of the health check to settle an issue such as quotas, which up until now, as I would like to point out to all those who have spoken, have made it possible to maintain dairy production in Europe, to ensure that the dairy industry is highly developed and, at the same time, to keep prices at a level that was easily affordable for customers.

 The objectives pursued by this regional convention: to replace more than 100 bilateral protocols with a single protocol; to integrate the countries of the Western Balkans into the pan-Euro-Mediterranean system of rules of origin; and to facilitate trade between the member countries, are contributing to the economic integration of the Euro-Mediterranean region, which has been a major objective of the EU’s Euro-Mediterranean policy since the Barcelona Process. In addition, its conclusion has been sought for a number of years by our partners in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean. After all the talk that accompanied the Arab revolutions, it is time to take action. The adoption of this convention will enable the EU to send for the first time a clear message of openness to trade to the countries of the southern Mediterranean, which are finally opening up to democracy. However, the convention alone will not suffice to bring about the major changes we are expecting in the EU’s trade relations with the southern Mediterranean. We therefore need to continue our efforts to support the development of South-South trade, to improve customs cooperation, to modernise the rules of origin themselves and, more generally, to review EU trade policy towards our Mediterranean partners, in that it should take more account of their interests.

 Mr President, on behalf of my four colleagues, I should like firstly to extend my warmest thanks to the MEPs who enabled the adoption of this initiative, and secondly to say that the European Parliament, in my view, is sending a very strong message today to our southern partners and, especially, to their young people, and that Parliament now expects the Commission to make proposals promptly so that the Erasmus and Leonardo programmes actually become a reality for these countries.

I voted in favour of the report by my fellow Member, Mrs Balzani, defining the position of Parliament in the forthcoming negotiations on the 2012 budget. Today, the European Parliament has given instructions to those of its Members who will represent it before the Council and the Commission in the budget negotiations starting on 11 July. If there is a message in this vote, it is that the vast majority of us are intent on warning the Council against any attempt to reduce the European budget. We are not of course advocating spending for spending’s sake. We are well aware of the terrible crisis ravaging our continent. However – and the Socialists have been saying this for a long time – Europe will not emerge from this crisis by sacrificing its future and selling tomorrow’s growth on the cheap. We should, rather, have the courage to speak out and not fear confronting populism. We do not need less Europe. We need more Europe. Until we give the Union the resources it needs to fulfil its ambitions, it would be an illusion to believe that it will be able to return to the path our citizens want to go down.

This resolution, which I had a hand in drawing up, comes at a critical moment, and thus a key moment, in the resolution of the conflict in South Sudan. In January, the South Sudanese overwhelmingly voted for their independence in a referendum. In one month, a new state will be born. However, there are still several concerns, especially after the recent incidences of violence in the disputed Abyei region. More than ever, in this pivotal period, Parliament intends to reaffirm its complete support for the peace process and to appeal to the Sudanese and South Sudanese, as well as the international community, to remain committed to implementing the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement. In particular, the European Parliament is calling on the Sudanese and South Sudanese to propose specific plans taking account of sensitive subjects, namely citizenship, the sharing of debt and of oil revenues. These plans will also have to deal with the difficult issue of borders in order to ensure that a peaceful and viable coexistence of the two states can be maintained. Vincent Peillon  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report by Mr Coelho proposing the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the ‘Schengen area’. This is one of the greatest achievements of the European integration process. The accession of a new State is conditional on strict compliance with the criteria of the Schengen Agreement. In the case of Bulgaria and Romania, the European Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties – like the European Commission – has concluded after evaluation that these two States meet the conditions laid down in full. Consequently, there is no longer any reason why they cannot integrate into this area of free movement. I would find it unacceptable if certain States, under false pretexts and motivated by internal political calculation, continued to oppose it. The Community acquis should not be regarded as an à la carte
 system where Member States can adapt or suspend provisions as circumstances dictate. Therefore, I solemnly call upon the Council to acknowledge the improvements made by Bulgaria and Romania and admit them into the Schengen area. Vincent Peillon  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the Audy report on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme on research and development. With this text, the European Parliament confirms its support for this programme, which is of vital importance for developing European research and improving the competitiveness of our businesses. It defends the establishment of a permanent budget, which is essential if it is going to be able to meet its targets. This report then sets out specific proposals with the aim of resolving the programme’s weaknesses. It rightly highlights the need to simplify funding procedures and optimise existing instruments, so as to facilitate access for small and medium-sized enterprises. Finally, this report reminds us that the European Commission needs to ensure that promoting innovation does not endanger the progress made in basic research. Vincent Peillon  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report presented by Mr Garriga Polledo on behalf of the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013. In a context where populism is on the increase, the effectiveness and even relevance of EU policies are regularly brought into question. Nonetheless, in the face of current crises, whether financial, economic, social or climatic, we do not need less but rather more Europe. This report therefore proposes finally giving the EU the resources to match its ambitions, by arguing for a substantial increase in the EU budget of a minimum of 5% and a mobilisation of the budgetary resources of the Union for the benefit of the EU 2020 strategy. Thanks to action by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the European Parliament also argues in this report for two strong measures: as far as revenue is concerned, an in-depth reform of the own resources system, in particular, through the creation of a tax on financial transactions (Tobin tax); as far as expenditure is concerned, the creation of a category of ‘intermediate regions’ to increase solidarity between the territories of the EU and ensure a fairer distribution of the regional policy’s Structural Funds.

 I voted against the resolution on the lessons to be drawn for nuclear safety in Europe following the nuclear accident in Japan, because I do not believe that the issue of the future of nuclear power – a crucial one for our fellow citizens – can be resolved by this House in a few hours through amendments adopted without any real debate. All the issues must be put on the table, and no options must be ruled out, which is exactly why we need time. At stake are the credibility of our Parliament and the wellbeing of our fellow citizens, who would not understand – and rightly so – if we were to commit them to long-term courses of action that we did not discuss calmly and exhaustively beforehand, taking into account the different national situations and the constraints of our common fight against climate change. Lastly, I should like to say how sorry I am that, due to extremists on all sides, Parliament has been unable to approve at this time an immediate increase in the safety of nuclear power plants, even though we in our group reached a consensus demanding the most serious, transparent and independent checks possible.

I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague and friend, Mrs Guillaume, on procedures for granting and withdrawing asylum in Europe. This text marks a major step forward in establishing a common European asylum system (CEAS) by 2012, thereby putting an end to the intolerable situation whereby, depending on the European country in which an asylum seeker applies for protection, his or her chances of being recognised as a refugee vary between 1% and 65%. Parliament has therefore spoken out in favour of greater justice and greater efficiency in the processing of asylum procedures. It proposes that each country observe the same enhanced rules on protecting rights and modernising procedures: free legal advice from day one, a framework for the time limit for appeals, special assistance for unaccompanied minors, and a faster examination of cases. Also, although I regret that the European right, which has a majority in Parliament, has managed to adopt amendments to the text which cast widespread, exaggerated suspicion on the sincerity of asylum seekers, I warmly welcome the adoption of this report. The ball is now in the court of those Member States that have yet to decide on our proposals. Vincent Peillon  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague and friend, Mr Arif, on the EU’s foreign direct investment (FDI) policy. With this document, Parliament formulates two, in my opinion, major requirements when defining how to frame future international investment protection agreements that are binding on Europe. The first requirement is that all these agreements include clauses compelling European investors to behave responsibly abroad in economic, social and environmental matters. The second requirement is that all these agreements leave scope for the governments of the countries receiving this investment to legislate for the common good. In the past, some private investment protection clauses enabled the adoption, by the third country, of social or environmental legislation to be regarded as indirect expropriation, resulting in compensation. We need to put an end to these abuses. While this Parliament has, for the first time, a say on such matters, the Arif report has fired a warning shot across the bows of the Council and the Commission as they prepare to open negotiations with India, Canada and, soon, with China.

rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

 Mr President, I should like first of all to thank Mr Kalfin for the excellent work we have been able to carry out together and, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for which I was the rapporteur, to thank my colleagues Mrs Hautala, Mr Lambsdorff and Mrs Giannakou. As he has done so himself, I am not going to review the positive points of the report and the proposal defended by Mr Kalfin on the climate change mandate, the increase in human resources, the attention paid to social and development aspects, the environment, human rights, the shift in focus of the guarantee towards countries that need it most, and a stronger link with EU policies. Parliament is united on all these points – let me make that clear – and it must remain so during the difficult negotiations that, as I have just heard, await us with the Council. I would like to draw attention to two shortcomings at this stage. I regret that neither the need to now prepare the EIB for microcredit nor the need to already begin the debate on the post-2013 ceilings has been taken on board, even though the Committee on Foreign Affairs voted for both of these things in the consensus reached by all the political groups. That is why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament decided, with the consent of Mr Kalfin and of the other rapporteurs, to table amendments in plenary on these two subjects. Lastly, there is one crucial point to which I should like, politically speaking, to draw your attention and which has been the subject of debate for years. When the Berlin Wall fell, we were able to react not only with the enlargement project, the practical arrangements of which some may question, but which is undeniably necessary, but before that, we established the EBRD so as to be able to support the necessary economic and democratic transition. The European Union, and also the EIB, as the power behind it, is the largest provider of funds to the other side of the Mediterranean. At the same time, however, we know that the payment of those funds will not continue beyond one programming period – in other words, beyond 2013, as I mentioned just now – and that the discussions that we are having today show that there may be difficulties in the future. There is a project – already adopted by the European Parliament and endorsed in the report on the Union for the Mediterranean – which is referred to in the Kalfin report being debated today, and it is the creation of a Euro-Mediterreanean codevelopment and investment bank. This would be a practical way, beyond rhetorical statements, of acknowledging the European Union’s will to support the major democratic movement taking place on the other side of the Mediterranean, and I hope that this will be seriously addressed and that steps will be taken, in the coming months, to promote the creation of that bank. Vincent Peillon,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, I should like to start by expressing my warmest thanks to all my colleagues who were involved in this report; this truly is a collective piece of work. We reached 28 compromises; compromises which enriched rather than watered down the strategic vision that we wanted to impart to this report, to our commitment to the Mediterranean. I should therefore like to extend my warmest thanks to Marietta Giannakou for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), Ivo Vajgl for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Hélène Flautre, and the rapporteurs for the opinions of the Committee on International Trade, Mrs De Sarnez, and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Mrs Tzavela. What was important, for us, was to make it understood that there are strategic issues at stake here for Europe. In fact, it is not just a question of thinking that the South needs us; we also need the South, especially in these times of crisis. If we want to have a long-term vision, if we want sustainable growth in a multipolar world, then we also need the South. In light of this, Europe needs to undertake to make the Union for the Mediterranean an area of peace, security and prosperity for its 800 million habitants and to look at this work as a long-term priority. It is this common will that allowed us to come together, because we know that the economic stakes, the demographic stakes, the geopolitical stakes that we are facing, like the social and cultural stakes, presuppose that we are capable of working with the other side of the Mediterranean. For us, it is also cultural and civilisation issues that are at stake. We know this; Parliament has worked in knowledge of the difficulties of setting up the Union for the Mediterranean for two years. We have not avoided tackling the question of conflicts taking place in the South, but we wanted to affirm very forcefully that it was precisely the approach of the Union for the Mediterranean, with specific projects, parity between North and South in decision-making bodies and the possibility, for example, of bringing Israelis and Palestinians to the same table, that was the right method for helping to resolve these conflicts and that, moreover, the Union for the Mediterranean should not be asked to pursue all the objectives at the same time and that it needed to focus on these specific activities. In this project – and I do hope that the second summit of Heads of State or Government will be held in Barcelona on 7 June – we, the European Parliament, wanted to send a strong message to the Heads of State or Government to tell them they must make a commitment because this summit must be a success. In light of this, we have pointed out the approaches that we think are necessary today. First of all, we need to remove certain obstacles, which, of course, include the financial and economic conditions. That is why the European Parliament hopes that the European Union will make a financial commitment commensurate with what is at stake, firstly in terms of what is left of the financial perspective 2007-2013, and that, in the financial perspective 2014-2020, the Union’s undertaking will be much greater, so that the six major projects on the table can be completed. We need to improve the economic and legal environment. We need to improve South-South regional integration. We also need, in addition to economic conditions, new political conditions, which is why we placed an emphasis on cultural integration, education, cultural projects and on the rights of men and women. To conclude: Europe, in this crisis, needs to look far and wide. We must not sacrifice the long term to the short term. We must assume our responsibilities. Europe needs the South. Vincent Peillon,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make three brief comments. Firstly, we have not been lacking in respect for anyone, especially not people who might be victims, but we considered that compassion, moral indignation and insults do not add up to a policy. Secondly, we have not, of course, ignored the conflicts which exist either in Cyprus or in the Sahara or, of course, in the Palestinian territories. Seriously, however, did we think, in the common foreign and security policy or in the various negotiations that have taken place, that it was up to the UfM to deal with these issues? You cannot be everything to everybody and confusion of the mind is not a recipe for efficiency. Thirdly, I too am sorry that the Council is not here. It is not a good sign when you find out that this lack of political will is giving us cause to believe – Dominique Baudis is right – that the summit on 7 June is in the balance. Be that as it may, Parliament will have assumed its responsibilities. The people who constructed Europe did so with a long-term vision and a keen sense – following the fratricidal wars that divided us – of the importance of specific policy. It is this same spirit that we wanted to develop with the Mediterranean in this report. With Europe in the throes of a major crisis, we need to be capable of defining a growth strategy, as I said earlier. We also need to ensure that we do not turn in on ourselves. When you turn in on yourself, when you stop having exchanges with the outside world, then you start to die. That is why I think that this collective piece of work is an important piece of work and I hope that the Heads of State or Government – who have not recently lived up to their historic responsibility – listen and take heed.

Madam President, as our fellow Members have said repeatedly this morning, the problem of financing the developing countries’ fight against global warming may cause the Copenhagen Summit to fail, when we were all hoping it would be a success. As we know, however, these countries are often the main victims of global warming, but they are not responsible for it. The industrialised countries have provided a substantial financial aid package. It is insufficient today, and even the declared amounts are not actually being honoured. This is what obliges us and will oblige us to find new sources of finance. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, following the lead of the Committee on Development, has acknowledged that there is now a need to consider the introduction of a tax on financial transactions of the Tobin tax kind. This 0.01% tax on speculative transactions would bring in USD 100 billion per year; in other words, the amount that it is estimated will be required by 2020 to combat global warming in developing countries. Therefore, Parliament, in following the lead of certain national political leaders, is assuming its responsibilities. I should like to know the position of the Council and the Commission and whether they will support us on this point.Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the strengthening of the rules on the removal of sharks’ fins on board boats. The existing rules permitted exemptions that meant that compliance with the ban on this cruel practice, which involves throwing live sharks back into the sea having removed their fins, could not be guaranteed. While sharks’ fins are the main ingredient in a highly-valued Asian soup, the rest of the meat is less sought-after. There is a great temptation to keep only the valuable part of the shark and to throw the rest of the carcass away, leading to overfishing of an animal of which many species are endangered. However, while the requirement that any fins landed must be attached to the body of the animal should facilitate controls, I remain convinced that the lack of resources allocated to these controls – concerning not only shark finning but also other species – remains the central problem with regard to overfishing, causing harm to the environment and to the overwhelming majority of fishermen, who carry out their work in a responsible and courageous way and face unfair competition that flouts all of the rules.

 I voted in favour of the new certification rules for two-or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles because ultimately they will improve safety for two-wheel users, who are very vulnerable, representing as they do a sixth of deaths on European roads, despite travelling only 2 % of the total distance. Anti-lock braking systems will be mandatory for motorcycles over 125 cc, and the increase in cost should be generally limited by the widespread implementation of this equipment, as has been the case with automobiles. Furthermore, new antipollution standards will be applied gradually between 2016 and 2020. Finally, the entry into force of this regulation in 2016 will signal the end for French motorcyclists of the 100 hp restriction on motorcycles, which has never really proved effective in terms of road safety and could cause insurance cover problems, for example, for a non-restricted vehicle bought abroad.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Monti report’s observation in 2010 was that the rules of the single market were focused primarily on competitiveness and trade in goods, and took no notice of citizens. To put this right, the Commission has presented 50 proposals to relaunch the single market, 12 of them legislative priorities that are currently being examined and are about to be approved. On the 20th anniversary of the single market, which we celebrate this month, the Commission is announcing a new set of proposals for the single market, entitled Act II. These include measures that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has been asking for for a long time, and we are delighted to see them become a reality at last. I refer in particular to the section on social entrepreneurship, cohesion and consumer confidence. I am delighted at the forthcoming improvement of rules on product safety, which is of prime importance for consumers, and at universal access to bank accounts, and the transparency needed on bank account fees. This legislation can demonstrate that Europe protects its citizens, is useful and is not just about austerity policies. The EU has not given up on its social model. We have a duty to maintain this courageous ambition, despite the handicaps. On the other hand, when it comes to Europe being protective and instilling confidence in its citizens, I am slightly more dubious about the proposals on transport and energy networks. I fear that the Commission is still stuck with its ideology of liberalising sectors of the network when we are still a long way from demonstrating the benefits for users, whether in terms of price or quality of services. It seems to me a more pressing issue to respond to the concrete expectations of citizens and consumers with legislation on collective redress, and framework legislation on public services, which we have been asking for for too long. Mr Barroso’s poor communication on public services was clearly not up to the challenge because these services also have a role in the revival of growth in a new industrial strategy. Similarly the Commission is congratulating itself on the potential for mobility that the single market offers citizens. This is to state the obvious, but it would be even better if there were a guarantee that social rights and pension rights would be recognised. The issue of mobility lies at the very heart of the legislation on recognising professional qualifications, on which I am rapporteur. The directive has to and will show that Europe can give real added value to growth, to employment and to its citizens, thanks to smart cooperation between all the institutions and in all the Member States. I am thinking particularly of the major innovation of a European Professional Card. I would like to thank my colleagues for the interest they have shown. We received more than 650 amendments. I know that we will reach some worthwhile compromises, including on sensitive issues like notaries and nurses. All that will remain is for us to persuade the Council to overcome the hesitancy of some Member States, because this is the message we need to give. Yes, the EU can and must be a source of progress and shared wealth to achieve positive, active solidarity between all of its Member States, driven by the same spirit of success from their shared destiny.

This report paints a picture which, regrettably, is hard to deny: we are very far from the goals set in 2004 and 2009. Creation of the Single European Sky is supposed to cut CO2
 emissions by 50 million tonnes and create 328 000 jobs, despite the constraints on growth in the sector as a result of the crisis and increased fuel prices. But, knowing the situation, I am unsure whether it is appropriate to penalise states which do not fulfil their commitments by the cut-off date of December 2012. The introduction of functional airspace blocks is a highly ambitious objective which has implications for national sovereignty and requires the interaction of air traffic control systems that are structured differently and operate differently, so it takes time to ensure a smooth and safe transition. I would be more in favour of incentives, and I think that, before putting forward a new ‘regulatory package’ when this one has not yet been properly implemented, we ought to … wait and conduct some serious assessments.

 The amendments to pharmacovigilance legislation finally introduce the principle of the automatic evaluation of a medicinal product at EU level if the product is withdrawn in a Member State. They also extend the list of drugs subject to additional monitoring. However, the Commission did the very bare minimum after the Mediator scandal. We should remember that its initial proposals on the texts adopted in 2010 were quite simply unacceptable. We had to fight to get rid of measures that were very favourable to the laboratories, making it easier for them to put on the market drugs that had been insufficiently tested with no therapeutic justification in terms of risk and benefit. Unfortunately, these minor changes do not integrate the fundamental measures we had asked for: the financial, hierarchical and intellectual independence of pharmacovigilance activities relating to the industry and medicines agencies, and the implementation of the requirement to demonstrate therapeutic progress in order to obtain a marketing licence. Nonetheless, Ms McAvan’s reports still represent progress in the expectation that a truly ambitious text will be proposed at the earliest possible opportunity. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Single Market Act is to make the market work for citizens again and to bring them and the market together, whilst recognising that an efficient single market can and must give rise to growth and sustainable job creation. Yet, the content of the recent legislative proposals and communications from the Commission show that its concerns are still predominantly focused on the promotion of trade to the detriment of measures aimed at employment and citizens. Some major issues are absent, namely: the promotion of good-quality jobs and rejection of social dumping, safeguarding the social protection model and public services, the portability of social and retirement rights, consumer protection in financial services and the right to collective redress. Parliament must remind the Commission that citizens want and need an innovative Europe that is able to create growth, protect them and also restore their confidence. The resolution that we will adopt tomorrow must send a strong signal in this direction. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, my question is for Commissioner Barnier. Would you mind telling me, please, how much progress the Commission has made with drafting legislation to provide operators in the social and solidarity-based economy with a status? I am referring to mutuals, foundations and cooperatives. These kinds of organisation indeed play a crucial role in cushioning crises and creating jobs and must therefore be protected, supported and encouraged to develop very quickly. Finally, if something concrete is in fact being drafted for the social economy, can we really be content with a simple communication on a quality framework for services of general interest which, in these times of economic and social crisis, also need to be protected by a genuine legal status? Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 – (FR)
 Mr Barnier knows as well as we do, and Parliament and the Commission must work together on this point, just how important this sector is for social cohesion and how much it needs legal certainty in order for social services to be exercised in EU countries. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Mr President, this partnership agreement with Morocco for agriculture and fisheries is an important act concerning a country that has had a shared history with Europe for centuries and is an important trading partner, with which the European Union maintains a net trade surplus. I understand the concerns that have been expressed. Although I have some doubts about certain political hijacking, or exploitation with regard to the rights of the people who are affected but not involved, I also have the same questions about the consequences of the liberalisation on the sectors of activity that are already highly vulnerable. That is why it is essential, Commissioners, to put in place effective compensatory measures to avoid any negative repercussions on European production and jobs. On that condition, I support this agreement because economic expansion in Morocco is an essential lever in consolidating a democratic process that all of us in this House sincerely want to see in that strategic part of the Mediterranean basin.

 Following the example of all the French socialist Members, I abstained on the vote on the Council agreement on the draft intergovernmental treaty adopted by the Heads of State or Government on 30 January. This agreement is not only legally questionable, as it flouts the role of Parliament, but also harmful, because the budgetary restrictions imposed will not resolve the crisis but, on the contrary, can only aggravate the recession. The renegotiation that we are calling for is a logical consequence of that. We must create growth in order to come out of this crisis: this is an economic necessity, and the dogmatic view imposed by Merkozy is not remotely adapted to this. We must restart a virtuous circle by coordinating our economic policies with major joint industrial projects, particularly in the fields of energy and the environment, and by boosting major infrastructure. This can only be achieved through the creation of Eurobonds, which are completely absent from this text, and true regulation of the financial markets, which we have long been calling for. Mr Sarkozy and Ms Merkel’s obsession with strict austerity is becoming dangerous for the whole of Europe. Bernadette Vergnaud,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. 
− (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Pervenche Berès on this outstanding report; it is the culmination of several months of work involving nine parliamentary committees. Thus, in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Catherine Stihler’s opinion emphasised the central role of the single market – the economic pillar of the EU – at the heart of governance focused on the aim of sustainable, inclusive and social growth, in line with the Europe 2020 strategy and in the interests of all our fellow citizens. If we are to take up this challenge, however, we must ensure that the European semester is not just an intergovernmental control system that imposes the diktat of certain Council Members on the national parliaments. Parliamentary consent to the public budget is one of the foundations of democracy. Hence it is imperative that the Annual Growth Surveys be adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure, with the European Parliament and the national parliaments cooperating closely with each other. This is a democratic requirement, and we must stand our ground. Bernadette Vergnaud,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, professional mobility is a key factor for competitiveness and growth in Europe, and is an integral part of the EU 2020 strategy and the Single Market Act. It relates to one of the fundamental rights of the EU: freedom of movement and of establishment. However, it remains limited because we are still lacking simple, clear rules for the recognition of professional qualifications. Repeated tidying-up of legislation does not hide the anachronism of some mechanisms that date back to a time when cross-border mobility was still anecdotal. The fact is that today, 50% of young Europeans are willing to go and work in another Member State, and the new directive will need to take up that challenge. This is a major project. The lack of basic harmonisation of training, the high number of regulated professions and the complexity of the recognition process create legal uncertainty, so much so that this issue accounts for 16% of the complaints made to the SOLVIT network. The main aim is to simplify procedures for citizens, guarantee transparent decision making and reduce delays through better cooperation between competent authorities and between Member States. The classification of economic activities should also be reviewed, because professions and related training requirements are constantly evolving. I welcome the fact that the report focuses on the specificities of the health care professions, due to the implications in terms of patient safety, of course. Finally, I clearly support the creation of a voluntary European professional card system. This type of card should, in particular, facilitate the steps involved and improve consumer and patient safety. Beyond that, this card will help to build a European identity and show that the single market is not only about movement of goods and people, but that it can and should be the basis for economic wealth and shared citizenship. I therefore congratulate Ms McClarkin on this good report, which, I hope, will be widely adopted tomorrow. Bernadette Vergnaud,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, public procurement is a wonderful tool for reviving the European economy, creating quality jobs and choosing more socially and environmentally sustainable offers. To achieve all these things, we have to change our policy of making the lowest price the sole criterion: it is the bedfellow of mediocrity insofar as it obliges public authorities to undertake convoluted procedures in order to choose quality. The report on which we will be voting tomorrow introduces the criterion of the most economically advantageous offer, which enables authorities to demand that tenderers meet high standards. I am grateful to Ms Rühle for having defended this principle so well; it will give operators greater flexibility and greater legal certainty. Another key point is access to public procurement markets, under favourable conditions, by operators in the social economy and small and medium-sized enterprises. European rules are very restrictive for these organisations. They must be improved so that these organisations can respond to major invitations to tender without having to act as subcontractors. In this regard, the very frequent use of this system presents real problems for SMEs affected by tariff dumping and for their employees, who do not benefit from the same pay and social conditions as their counterparts who are employed by large groups. A chain of responsibility must be envisaged. It is unacceptable for main service providers to be allowed to transfer their responsibilities to small subcontractors. I therefore call on you to vote in favour of maintaining paragraph 22, so that employees’ rights are respected and job-creating small businesses are protected in every Member State. Lastly, I am pleased that the Member States have been asked to sign ILO Convention C94 on labour clauses (public contracts). That Convention has been around since 1949, but only 11 Member States are signatories to it. However, I regret that it has not been possible to go further with regard to reciprocal access to public procurement markets in industrialised and emerging third countries. Europe can no longer be the only one to respect the rules, and therefore I ask you to vote against the deletion of paragraph 29. This report is a balanced text, and I call on you not to distort it tomorrow. Doing so would undermine the interests of our industry, our businesses and workers. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

I have declared my support for Mrs Sender’s report as it is not only a major step forward for road safety but also for European citizenship. How can we make motorists understand that they have to obey the rules in their country when they see drivers with foreign plates committing offences with total impunity? It is, above all, an issue of equality before the law. Whilst I can only regret that three Member States have refused to participate, it is a first step towards harmonisation and the objective is clearly road safety, as only serious offences, rather than, for example, parking offences, will result in follow-up cross-border proceedings.

 Following the example of the French Socialist delegation, I voted against the Roth-Behrendt report on EU legislation on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) and on related feed and food controls. It is difficult to understand, 15 years after the start of the mad cow crisis, how we could act as if nothing had happened and how we can envisage putting animal meal intended for ruminants back onto the market, even if subject to strict controls. The current crisis in the livestock sector, linked, in particular, to rising world cereal prices, has to be resolved by regulations at the economic and trade level and by combating speculation, and certainly not by endangering health security.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have been working on this issue for three years now and, in view of the challenges and the huge lobbying efforts of the food industry, I am delighted with the result achieved. I particularly welcome the introduction of mandatory complete nutritional labelling, which will enable consumers to choose healthy products. Allergens will be clearly listed, including for non-prepacked food, and a minimum font size will improve the legibility of information. Mandatory origin labelling for all meat is a real step forward. I hope we will be able to extend it to milk products and to processed fish and meat. It was also essential that alcoholic beverages were not included, Commissioner, because, in my view, they should be subject to specific, specially adapted rules. We could have done better, particularly by introducing legible and harmonised front-of-pack nutritional labelling. However, a major step has been taken toward the civic education of European consumers. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Twenty years after it was introduced, 112 is certainly accessible in all Member States, but only 26% of EU citizens know about it. This is an unacceptable state of affairs, which is why I have fought for Parliament to send out a message to the Commission and to Member States. I therefore welcome the vote on Mrs Rapti’s report calling for improvements to service quality and to the information available about this number. More effective regulation is needed, and it is important that we promote the exchange of best practice and ensure that EU funds are properly allocated. It is essential for automated caller location during emergency calls to be faster, and for the future of 112 to be guaranteed by ensuring the reliability of calls made via Skype. We must also introduce the ‘reverse 112’ automated SMS alert system for use in the event of a disaster. As regards universal service, whilst in the long term the plans are to extend the universal broadband service only, I am delighted in particular with the reminder of service providers’ obligation to abide by EU rules on neutrality on the networks. It is unacceptable that their customers might not be able to access the services, content and applications of their choosing over the Internet. Thank you. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 This vote is important because the Commission has to take the necessary measures to prevent unfair competition and non-reciprocity of access to public contracts in relation to third countries. This is not about erecting protectionist barriers, but the Union can no longer be the only one to play by the rules. Indeed, we can no longer ignore the social and economic dumping practised by companies in emerging countries who are winning contracts in countries of the Union, in defiance of social rights and legislation on State subsidies, while, in the meantime, the markets of these countries are closed to European companies. However we must also not forget that the large industrialised countries, despite signing international agreements, do not play by the rules either! After years of inaction, the Commission seems intent on acting, and that is necessary: the survival of our companies and jobs depends on it. Finally, I welcome the adoption of the amendments put forward by the Group of the Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament with regard to compliance, in the context of public procurement, with working, social and environmental standards in force in the Member States. It is now for the Commission to size up this call. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate all those MEPs who had a hand in drafting these reports. I think that we have managed to produce three balanced texts, which send a strong signal from Parliament to the College of Commissioners about our priorities for a Single Market that operates effectively on behalf of our citizens, for growth and for enterprises. As shadow rapporteurs for Mr Buşoi’s report, we have created a clear road map for the Commission. Firstly, and here we are all in agreement, Commissioner, there is a proposal for a legislative framework for public procurement, public/private partnerships and service concessions which should protect small operators, SMEs and awarding local authorities, and which will guarantee reciprocity between the EU, the industrialised countries and the major developing countries. Then there is the need to ensure that we prioritise the common consolidated corporate tax base and a clear VAT framework. That is crucial if we want our SMEs to flourish within a healthy competitive environment. Finally, we must ensure that innovation is funded, in order to stimulate strong and sustainable growth in major European infrastructure projects, through the creation of Eurobonds. I should like to finish by stressing how important it is, to my mind, that we have reached a satisfactory compromise on the key issues of being able to guarantee social rights in the different legislations of the Single Market and of protecting services of general interest within the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon. Commissioner, we are sending you a very clear message: the economy must be at the service of the citizens, and not the other way round. You need our help. Today, we give you this help, along with a major challenge: that of reconciling our citizens with the European project. So do not let us down and give them the confidence they need!

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mrs Gebhardt, for their work. The Commission’s initial proposal was indeed absurd, as it endangered the level of consumer protection by wanting to harmonise it completely. This is only justifiable so long as harmonisation is upwards and not downwards, as proposed. Therefore I welcome most of the compromises reached, which leave the possibility for Member States to apply stricter rules if they so wish, while guaranteeing a high minimum level for all consumers in the Union. Thus, maximum contract duration is limited to 12 months, information on distance contracts or telesales contracts is improved, with payment being required only when the cooling-off period, set at 14 days, has expired. On the other hand, it is unacceptable to keep full harmonisation regarding chapter V, relating to unfair terms. Not only is the chosen level of protection unsatisfactory, it is also tantamount to ignoring the reality of fraudulent practices, since these require a level of responsiveness that European legislation cannot offer. That being the case, taking away all room for manoeuvre from Member States in this area seems like an irresponsible move. Consequently I hope that the colegislators manage to come up with a balanced text which guarantees a genuine and common core of high-level protection. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D
),

 Having been rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament on the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I am delighted with the text that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has adopted, which contains many of the proposals we and other associated committees made. In this respect, I think Edite Estrela’s report is excellent, as it places the emphasis on some of the crucial aspects of our European social and healthcare model: equality of access to high quality healthcare for everyone in Europe, better management of reproductive health, monitoring of the efficacy and quality of drugs through independent pharmacovigilance systems and, above all, the necessity of high levels of public funding for healthcare during this period of economic crisis. Health is not a general good like other goods, and our welfare systems have the duty to ensure that the most disadvantaged have access to healthcare. I am naturally astounded therefore at the votes to remove some of the abovementioned points requested by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group. This step smacks of reactionary neoliberalism, and I hope that the final vote will preserve the spirit of this report and be a credit to this Parliament. Bernadette Vergnaud,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Services Directive was the subject of unprecedented public political debate when it was being discussed in Parliament. Thanks to the efforts to reach a compromise, which were led by Mrs Gebhardt, whom I congratulate, the text that Parliament succeeded in adopting in 2006 was one that reconciled the need to stimulate the internal market in services as a source of potential growth and job creation, and respect for social rights, labour law and the specific nature of services of general interest. In order to maintain this very fragile balance, the directive had to be transposed with the utmost care. This caused problems for many Member States, such as difficulties in implementing the points of single contact and the mutual evaluation process. Right now, I am concerned about and question the choice made by France; it is very much a minority choice and will result in provisions being split up between a whole series of laws and decrees. I also regret the very restrictive interpretation of the concept of authorising the provision of services. It will create legal uncertainty for social services relating to the care of young children and the disabled, even though derogation and exclusion possibilities were provided for in the directive. Parliament is playing, and will continue to play, a full part in monitoring the successful implementation of this directive, which is key to ensuring that the single market creates jobs and is closer to the citizens, and that Europe is experienced on a daily basis as something positive, not something negative. I therefore call on the Member States and the Commission to step up their efforts to guarantee a completely transparent process for European citizens.

Compared to the Commission’s initial proposal, which facilitated patient mobility with a market-oriented perspective on health, I welcome the progress reflected in this agreement. It was essential in order to safeguard our social protection systems that we re-establish a prior authorisation system for hospital or cost-intensive treatment. Similarly, the reference to Article 168 of the Treaty was necessary in order to ensure that the prerogatives of the Member States in terms of organising their public health systems were respected. Finally, commendable progress has been made in terms of cooperation and patient information. There are, however, still major deficiencies: the lack of consideration given to the mobility of professionals, medical demography and the ageing population. Other legislative proposals should remedy this – in particular, the proposal regarding professional qualifications – and in those proposals, it will be important to reaffirm that health is a sector with specific characteristics and not a commodity governed solely by the laws of the market, but rather the most precious asset that citizens have.

 The adoption today in plenary of a budgetary amendment to mobilise the EU Solidarity Fund to the tune of EUR 35.6 million following a proposal by the Commission is good news. This is in response to the request made by the French Government following storm Xynthia, which hit the French coast on 27 and 28 February 2010, leaving 53 people dead and 80 injured in Vendée and Charente-Maritime. The procedure is undoubtedly long and in need of improvement, but I am pleased to see European solidarity being shown in this way, in the face of the tragedy the victims have experienced. I had written to Commissioner Hahn to support the French Government’s request for aid, and he has honoured the commitment he made to me during his visit to La Rochelle in early March. This fund is more than much-needed financial assistance; it symbolises the common values shared by our continent. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by pointing out that I did not believe it right to give our opinion so early on with a vote on the events that took place in Laâyoune on 8 November, when we do not have all the facts at our disposal to give us the necessary hindsight and objectivity. Nevertheless, given these conditions, I am relieved to see that we have reached a relatively balanced and measured joint resolution which takes into account the concept of human rights and which does not unduly condemn either party, even though some points are questionable. In any case, the most important thing I think is not to inflame the situation further so that investigations and negotiations can be conducted in an atmosphere of calm, and so I think it wise not to be drawn into challenging the privileged status of a neighbouring partner country on the basis of partial and often contradictory reports.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a few months after Professor Monti’s report, which called for a necessary recovery of the citizen-oriented internal market, I welcome the Commission’s response. What particularly stands out in my mind is the improved recognition of professional qualifications, aid for SMEs, the new legislation on public contracts and service concessions, and legal certainty for the social economy. I therefore welcome this ambition. However, I regret that, in the 50 proposals, there is no clear definition of priorities. I am worried about the piecemeal strategy of the various Directorates-General and Commissioners and call on Mr Barroso to become more involved in order to avoid contradictory proposals. Finally, I deplore the absence of any real commitment on services of general interest given that, for years, we have been asking for protective legislation, which is now possible under the Treaty of Lisbon. For that reason, Mr Barnier, I am waiting to see the final texts before making my mind up and possibly supporting you in this major challenge for the future of Europe and of all its citizens. Bernadette Vergnaud,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Weiler, on her work and the remarkable compromise achieved with the Council, as the Commission’s initial proposal had some major faults. I would like to go back over four important points achieved in this directive. First, I am very pleased that there is a guarantee in place on equal treatment of the public and private sectors. The Commission was expecting heavier sanctions for the public sector, even though the latter works in the general interest. This was the result of ignorance about the reality of the state of the Member States’ public accounts, and could have resulted in a competitive disadvantage for public companies. Another move forward is the extension of payment terms to 60 instead of 30 days for public health services, which have complex budgetary procedures forcing them to have longer payment terms, for which they cannot be held responsible. Still on the subject of payment terms, it was essential to establish a ban on unfair contractual terms affecting creditors in contracts between companies, which often happens between a large group and a small and medium-sized enterprise. Finally, and this relates primarily to the small and medium-sized enterprises which are victims of payment delays, the introduction of an 8% interest rate in the event of a delay and compensation to cover collection costs could encourage these companies to demand damages. Until now, they have tended to refuse to do so at the risk of this jeopardising anything. I am therefore delighted to be able to vote on this bill which, I hope, will constitute real progress for the viability and good health of European businesses, progress that is needed not only for a more successful internal market, but also a fairer one. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, pharmacovigilance, which involves analysing the side effects of medicinal products and calling for their withdrawal from the market in the event of an alert, incited little interest in the midst of the pharmaceutical package. It is, however, essential to the safety and quality of our health systems and, even though I am delighted to see you, Commissioner, I must deplore Mr Dalli’s absence. I was dismayed by the Commission’s proposals, which jeopardised the pharmacovigilance systems for the benefit of the pharmaceutical companies. Fortunately, thanks to the work of Parliament and the Council, the situation has been improved somewhat. Thus, it will not be possible to generalise advance marketing authorisations for new medicinal products. We can also be pleased with the progress made in terms of transparency. However, I think that this agreement represents a missed opportunity to improve pharmacovigilance and I am concerned, above all, at the lack of guarantees regarding the independence of the system. Thus, even though the role of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee has been strengthened, it is not totally independent of the European committee which grants the marketing authorisation. We know from experience that this committee is loath to go back on its decisions. As for national structures, there is absolutely no provision on the matter. Also, I am sorry that the Member States do not have to report possible conflicts of interest of experts on the European committee. Finally, and this is the most serious point, this agreement endorses the end of the best guarantee of independence: public funding for pharmacovigilance activities, most of which will be funded in future by private fees. I congratulate Mrs McAvan on having improved the Commission’s initial proposal but, as there are a number of problematic issues, I question the point of closing this dossier in a single reading. If we had taken our time, we could have increased patients’ confidence in safe, high quality pharmaceutical products. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

I condemn the ostrich politics of those who think that the European Court of Justice’s current case-law on service concessions is satisfactory and that there is absolutely no need to legislate. For years, the socialists have fought and campaigned to obtain framework directives protecting services of general interest, and there is no question of us abandoning this commitment. The only long-term guarantee for public services is real European legislation, not judicial decisions, however well-founded they may be. As we can see with the difficulties in transposing the Services Directive in relation to social services, only a specific framework can provide legal certainty and quality of service. Small and medium-sized enterprises and local and regional authorities expect clarity and legal certainty in the awarding of public procurement contracts such as social housing public procurement contracts. However, neither did we want to vote against this report, which contains important elements, in particular, as regards social and environmental standards, which we must be able to integrate into tender procedures, recommendations to facilitate SME access, and a clear call for vigilance in public-private partnership contracts. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by expressing my deepest sympathy and solidarity with the victims of the Madeira floods and of storm Xynthia. The necessary questions must be asked about the worrying increase in these destructive meteorological phenomena, and about the role played by climate change and the urgent need to find solutions. For now, it is a case of providing urgent solutions to the populations rocked by these disasters. Of course, public and private insurance providers must be responsive but, when it comes to the destroyed infrastructure and rebuilding the areas concerned, European solidarity must be expressed. That is why the French Government has requested aid from the EU Solidarity Fund, created in 2002, which I hope will be granted quickly and meaningfully. This is the thrust of the two letters that I have sent to the Commission since 1 March in my capacity as an elected representative for the west of France region and which I had the opportunity to discuss, last Thursday, in La Rochelle, with Commissioner Hahn, whom I sincerely thank for being so responsive. Commissioner Hahn agreed that the mechanism was complex and difficult to implement. Well, we have to conclude that it could have been made more flexible if the Council had not incomprehensibly blocked the review of the operation of this fund as adopted by a very large majority of MEPs in May 2006. I therefore hope that the Spanish Presidency will break the deadlock on this text so that the system can be made more effective. In more immediate terms, I call on the Commission to authorise a one­off increase in cofinancing via the ERDF and ESF regional funds for projects in the regions affected, within a time frame that will enable their economies to recover by summer. Lastly, this aid should not be used to rebuild in such a way that the same tragic environmental and town planning mistakes are made; rather, it should be used in a considered way, so as to prevent as far as possible a repeat of such tragedies.

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have the opportunity to mention during a priority debate these three reports concerning citizens’ everyday lives. I would like, moreover, to congratulate our rapporteurs on their work and, more specifically, to mention the SOLVIT network. The network has now been in existence for eight years; it has resolved many problems effectively and yet it is completely unknown. How many times have I had to refer people to this network, the existence of which they did not even suspect, even though this tool could strengthen the image of a Europe protective of its citizens’ rights. I must admit – and I am very glad that Mr Barnier is here – that I understand that my country’s government does not really promote it. The increased number of cases would consequently be very tricky to manage for the sole trainee who, currently in 2010, is in charge of the SOLVIT network in France, a country which, it is true, has only 60 million inhabitants and which is only the second Member State in the EU from the point of view of the number of cases submitted in 2009. Indeed, the resolution rate is amazingly good, but the time periods are dreadful, with an average of 15 weeks before cases are dealt with, which is five weeks beyond the maximum allowed. I would therefore ask the Commission and the Member States to grant real financial and human resources and to conduct major information campaigns, aimed especially at businesses, which submitted no more cases in 2009 than in 2004.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have already discussed the fears linked to the transposition of the Services Directive. In this sense, the example of the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications is symbolic. Some States have failed to respect the transposition deadline and are having problems due to the gaps in the text. Although this directive lays a solid foundation for mutual recognition, the specific characteristics of certain professions have not been taken into account. The fact is, recognising qualifications without having established actual common levels of qualification and training, including for higher education, can only cause complications and create mistrust on the part of Member States, professionals and the citizens. The most obvious example is that of the medical professions. For example, French midwives are authorised to write prescriptions and are trained for that, which is not the case in other countries. What happens when a midwife without such authorisation arrives in France without additional training and has to write a medical prescription? Similarly, certain specialisms do not exist in every Member State. This directive is crucial to the free movement of workers, the foundation on which the European project is based, but it must be improved and enhanced, and the difficulties encountered must serve to identify the professions for which language teaching and harmonised training are necessary. I should like to mention the remarkable initiative, which is supported by all health professionals, to create a European card. This is a genuine guarantee as much for the carrier as for the customer or patient, and I call on the Commission to extend it to other professions, since this will enable us to improve mutual recognition and to gain the citizens’ trust.

 I am delighted to see this lengthy, highly controversial work reach its conclusion; it shows the importance of the telecommunications sector not only as an economic player but also as a vital element in today’s society. Our citizens communicate across borders on a daily basis and our aim was to guarantee quality of services while ensuring that users’ fundamental rights were respected. I want to congratulate Mrs Trautmann and the negotiating team for the compromise they have achieved, making any sanctions taken against users subject to a prior contradictory procedure. Furthermore, the Commission was committed to guaranteeing net neutrality and to combating anti-competitive, discriminatory practices carried out by operators. This agreement will mean consumers benefit from many positive developments which were sometimes the result of tough negotiations. I particularly wish to highlight guaranteed access and localisation for calls made to the emergency number (112); improved access for the disabled; greater information on contracts and billing; warnings in cases of unusually high usage; the introduction of a maximum delay when transferring a customer’s telephone number; and information in cases of security breaches relating to personal data.

Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since its adoption and the heated debates that surrounded it, the Services Directive has somewhat faded into obscurity, but it is important to show that we are particularly vigilant in the crucial phase of its transposition. I question the interpretation of the provisions of Article 2 of the directive linked to the exclusion of social services from its scope. Notions such as ‘support for persons in need’ and ‘mandated providers’ seem restrictive when compared with the definition of social services used in certain Member States, and I am concerned that a deliberately strict interpretation may serve to justify the inclusion of whole swathes of these services in the scope of the directive. The exclusion of these services is a key element of the text and a guarantee for the citizens that the European social model will be protected. I hope that certain Member States, including France, will not take advantage of the transposition in order to liberalise social services, under the false pretext that they are complying with European laws. These problems to do with the integration of services of general interest demonstrate the need to have European legislation that is specific to them and not to stick to a default definition as part of a directive on commercial services.

I voted against Mr Barroso’s candidacy, above all, because I believe in a genuinely political Europe, which cannot be satisfied with a Commission bound by the desiderata of big business. I also believe that one cannot campaign by calling for another form of European leadership only to then give a blank cheque to a champion of liberalism whose programme is sorely lacking in ambition and values. A man who has taken shelter behind the idea of ‘better regulation’ in order to ‘deregulate’ everything that I, as a socialist, defend: public services, social protection of workers, respect for health systems, regulation of the financial economy and protection of consumers and of the environment against the power of industrial groups. Out of respect for my own convictions and those of the electorate, I feel that these values cannot be called into question by ulterior motives and tricks aimed at obtaining derisory concessions from conservatives who control the majority of the Member States, the European Parliament and the Commission, and who will not rest until they have furthered their deregulatory policy.

Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, this summer our Member States reached an agreement on a growth pact. In the autumn, they are foolishly unable to agree on the resources for it. Budgetary discipline is one thing, but it is the citizens who are paying the price of the crisis because of the loss of jobs. They are waiting for policies that promote economic recovery, reinvigorate the internal market and ensure greater solidarity. That is why, like other Members – and I say this straight away to President Barroso – we cannot accept the Commission’s proposal as a ceiling; it is the absolute lowest level to which the European Parliament could sink. The proposals of the Cypriot Presidency, like those of Mr Van Rompuy, are just not enough. They are not enough to enable us to achieve a balance that encourages regional development and regional fairness, between the agriculture and Cohesion Fund policies, for example. They are not enough for a number of activities that guarantee the European Union’s competitiveness, such as industrial policy, research and the Connecting Europe Facility. They are not enough to offer guarantees for young people, access to training, Erasmus funding, or consideration of all young people for lifelong learning, as well as lifelong learning for other groups, such as adults and older people. As Mr Barroso said, that is the fifth freedom. Finally, there are no longer any resources for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund or food aid for the most deprived. Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore ask you to make a real investment in infrastructure, in the economy, and in the future of our young people. Catherine Trautmann,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets
. − Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, among the numerous challenges that the introduction of the European Semester presents, I would like to mention two key aspects. First of all, this mechanism must not simply be an instrument for formal surveillance of budgetary policies between Member States and by the Commission. On the contrary, the European Semester must allow sincere and in-depth collaboration between the European Parliament and national parliaments, in keeping with our respective competences and the democratic principle. It is the only valid way forward with a view to complementarity of national budgetary policies. Secondly, with regard to the European budget: our Parliament, by a massive vote in favour of the Kalfin and Böge report, pointed out that 94 % of this budget was an investment budget. On that basis, I proposed, in my opinion included in the report, exploring the possibility of excluding Member States’ contributions to the EU budget from the calculation of the structural deficit, as defined in the two-pack, the six-pack and the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (TSCG). Our Parliament is conducting the mother of all battles, for a European budget that meets the overall interests of the EU and its citizens. That is the direction of this proposal, addressed both to net contributory and beneficiary States. It would free up budget negotiation. In fact, it would make it possible to leave behind the damaging logic of fair return and the search for rebates and move to an approach based on contribution in the noblest sense of the term. In addition, such a calculation method would make the most of all payments to our common budget, including those made by beneficiaries. Consequently, I ask Mr Gauzès, our rapporteur, to look again at his request, on behalf of the PPE, to remove this proposal. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr Barroso, I think the State of the Union, for us members, is the State of Europeans. Europeans are troubled by three things: financial matters, health and employment. I would have liked to have talked about protecting people’s savings. I would have liked more ambition on the issue of re-equipping our industries through energy, the environment and digital technology. I would also have liked you to show a little more insight. If we are actually going to get out of this crisis, we need a timetable that is appropriate for the efforts of Member States and citizens. I would add, in this respect, that there is no democratic progress without social rights and, on a social level, as some have said, it is still not good enough. We need guarantees in terms of employment, in terms of not attacking the European social model as well as guarantees in terms of the financial and fiscal effort of all those who elect us and who want to regain confidence in the European Union. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).  
– (FR) 
Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, the decision taken in Brussels is a welcome breath of fresh air, and even if there remains a lot to do, the conclusions of this summit mark the end of an era and represent the first stage of a revival for our citizens, that of a Europe that gives itself the means to be fairer and show more solidarity. The issue of growth is no longer taboo and the discussion about the broad economic guidelines is now under way. The European Union will not be able to emerge from the rut of the crisis without breaking the vicious circle of austerity, which could condemn Member States to an endless recession. I am delighted that this sound political sense can at last be found in the conclusions and I am glad that France and its President, Mr Hollande, have contributed to this political rebalancing and are committed, out of solidarity, to the path of integration. However, although hope is essential, full implementation is what will restore confidence permanently. With EUR 120 billion having been mobilised within the framework of the Growth and Employment Pact, and EUR 10 billion of recapitalisation from the European Investment Bank (EIB), these will allow bonds to be issued for the purpose of financing projects. The European Parliament must be heard concerning a coherent financial framework and own resources. The mobilisation of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the launch of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which we would have liked to see granted a banking licence, is the most urgent matter for Spain and Italy, without forgetting the Greek citizens who have been hit hard by the crisis. The quick implementation of a banking supervisor for the euro area is only the first step towards banking union, which Parliament strongly advocates. Moreover, we cannot content ourselves with a limited tax on financial transactions, even if its implementation within the framework of enhanced cooperation could constitute a first step. In this way, we expect a lot from the next European Council, where the group of four – four Presidents, of course – will have to propose an ambitious road map in order to advance economic and monetary union and to enable the definitive resolution of the sovereign debt crisis and the instability of the euro area. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to give our fellow citizens concrete proof of our capacity to resolve the crisis, first and foremost, through growth fuelled by investment. Can you justify, in these times of precarious employment, doing away with the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), which is supposed to support workers who have lost their jobs because of globalisation, especially when we have to reinvent an industrial policy for Europe? Solidarity and insecurity are affecting a new population of young people, unemployed workers, women and pensioners. Yet those same people who were unable to manage this crisis would choose to do away with the European food distribution programme? Mr President, I ask that it be maintained beyond 2013, without doing away with any other essential programmes. The last aspect is cohesion. The regions must not be held responsible for the poor management of the Member States. We reject the strengthening of macro-economic conditionality because, in a time of crisis, we need to be able to adjust the support policies where economic growth is regional and where jobs can be provided. We therefore stand alongside the trade unions and NGOs that are fighting for solidarity, and alongside the regions, which must play a key role in the vitality of the territories in order to promote more growth, employment and social justice.

 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, Greece has been forced into an endless spiral of austerity and today, these modern-day doctors Diafoirus, these advocates of blood-letting, are refusing to deliver the aid promised. How do we explain this to the Greek citizens who are being doubly punished with pressure and injustice? There are alternative approaches. Let me propose one: the fight against tax avoidance. The tax haven provided by Switzerland costs Greece an estimated EUR 16.4 billion in loss of earnings. Tackling this resolutely would enable Greece to get back on track with the stability pact without sacrificing the future. Greece has been pushed by circumstances into considering a bilateral agreement with Switzerland, similar to the Rubik agreements signed by the United Kingdom and Germany. Executing this partial levy on fraudulent investments, instead of prosecuting fraudsters, is institutional recognition of tax fraud and a bad deal financially. The Union should follow the example of the United States, which has successfully forced Switzerland to provide the bank details of suspected fraudsters. What are the Commission’s plans now that its services have concluded the illegality of these agreements in a note that I believe should be made public? What does it suggest for the future now that its proposed Savings Tax Directive has been buried by the Council and, in particular, by Germany? In short, what does it intend to propose so as to stop constantly penalising the poor? I would like it if the Commissioner could respond because this question is important, but I can see that he has not been listening. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 – (FR)
 Mr President, I am not going to give in to politicking – I want to assure Mr Reul of that – because I believe that this treaty is setting us up for failure and I deeply regret it. I regret it because it is inefficient in its response to the market in the face of the crisis as it does not rebuild confidence. We have seen the problems Greece and Portugal have had in the same period. We are seeing two countries, who are the greatest contributors to our budget, France and Germany, whose growth rates have been halved. We understand that it is the wording of this treaty which, normally, should have served to settle things and reassure everyone, including the people. In reality, it is the action of the ECB which has had a positive effect, by making over EUR 500 billion of liquidities available to the banks. However, in Parliament, we must realise that we have to be consistent. We are elected by our voters; and our voters are the retired people who are in debt, the workers who marched through the streets of Brussels, the unemployed people waiting for work, and the young people who want to have a future. We cannot content ourselves with criticising a treaty which is based solely on fiscal discipline, on penalties, and which, even worse, introduces government by the judiciary to the detriment of the sovereignty of national parliaments. We, the Members of the European Parliament, should rise up against this outcome and put forward proposals. I, for one, have proposals that I should like to put forward. This is not simply about criticising. I believe, Mr President, that what we can propose today for Europe is a virtuous circle, a European pact of responsibility, governance and growth. This treaty must be renegotiated, on a basis which allows for true coordination of economic policies, including industrial projects to provide work for our factories and our workers, projects in the fields of energy and the environment, the creation of Eurobonds, which have regrettably been forgotten about or crossed off the agenda, and financial regulation.

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, the cheers that accompanied this agreement have already stopped. Is anyone surprised? The package offers no immediate solution to the crisis: no pooling of debt via Eurobonds – even though they have Mr Van Rompuy’s backing – and no strengthening of the European Financial Stability Facility or provision of a banking licence to enable it to raise funds via the ECB, which will not intervene in sovereign debt matters. What happened to using the tax on financial transactions as a fair taxation tool and an own resource? Perhaps there is no longer any urgency. After all, Mr Sarkozy, having pushed through two austerity plans in order to maintain France’s AAA rating, declared yesterday that a rating downgrade was not such a big obstacle to overcome. Who are they trying to kid? In the longer term, this agreement will be one of sanctions and fear, and it will put a little more pressure on the Member States, which are already struggling. The austerity policies decreed by ‘Merkozy’ are set to plunge Europe back into recession, and Europeans into unemployment. Where is the solidarity? Where are the jobs and growth? Europe is not a poor Union, but it needs to revitalise its industry, develop its infrastructure and offer its young people prospects for the future. This requires investment, which the Member States and the Union should be helped to finance. This is what justifies revising this Treaty. Any other decision would mean bypassing the national parliaments and the European Parliament and would thus be undemocratic. How can one explain the fact that a future French presidential candidate consulted neither the opposition parties nor his parliament before pledging his country’s signature? That is something that no one can understand or accept. Catherine Trautmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, during the negotiations on the telecoms package, the European Parliament already advocated the need to respect the Internet’s neutrality. Transparency on how traffic is managed in times of network overload and a minimum quality of service are basic requirements, but the persistent blocking of Internet content, as was just mentioned, or applications shows that these requirements are not enough. Let us therefore remember the essential nature of the Internet for fundamental rights and media pluralism and the need to ensure the confidentiality of communications and people’s private lives. Telecoms operators can contribute to economic recovery. They must be given the opportunity to innovate and invest in the development of new services, but the quality of basic Internet services, with which we are familiar, must not under any circumstances be allowed to decline in favour of paid services. We oppose the creation of a two-speed Internet which would be discriminatory for the most modest-income households, who are already hard-hit by the crisis. Finally, if the findings of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) require it, we would ask the Commission to assume its responsibilities and produce a binding text which ensures the Internet’s neutrality. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, our colleague who has just spoken is right. We need networks, we need an economic development model which gives us a future in every sector. Let us take the case of youth employment. There is no way we can believe in the future and trust policies when youth unemployment is over 15% or 20% and when young people are even denied a first job. I was disappointed by what Mr Barroso had to say. I would have liked practical solutions, for instance, priority access to public procurement for companies that hire young people for their first job. I would have also liked the Commission to present a tailored strategy for development. Yes, we have regions in Europe that are worse off than others. Yes, we have pockets of poverty and, with that in mind, we found out that one Head of State was calling into question the sustainability of the funding for the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union (PEAD). If there is no future for young people, if there is no solution for the most deprived, if there is no development strategy, you have enough resources to carry out social impact assessments, sector by sector, to determine where jobs can be created in companies, industry and services. It is not enough to say or claim that we could guarantee job security; we must ensure that the young and unemployed can access qualified jobs that enable them to find a solution, since without a job, there is no social dignity. How much progress has the Commission made on the Posting of Workers Directive, Commissioner? We have been waiting a long time for the divide between our countries concerning human resources and employees to be removed. I would like and hope to receive specific answers from you and I shall conclude by saying that I am disappointed that Mr Barroso only devoted one hour to a year-long programme that is meant to bring about a sustainable recovery and a permanent resolution to our Member States’ sovereign debt. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, this morning my feelings are both of relief and concern. I feel relieved because at least last night’s agreement exists as we could not risk another failure. The restructuring of the Greek debt takes the European contribution to more than EUR 200 billion, adding together private debts, the euro area stability fund and the public aid plan. The first stage of recapitalising the banks loosens the current stranglehold by increasing own funds. I particularly welcome the increase of the European Financial Stability Facility rescue fund to EUR 1 000 billion, at last, in my view, as the socialists have always believed that this fund was not sufficiently resourced. However, as a European, let me share with you the reasons for my concern, which are serious ones. I fear that all we did last night was to increase our capacity to carry out a patch-up job, and that we neglected the foundations of our common edifice. On reading this agreement, I can see grounds for two major reservations: firstly, its ‘short term’ nature. The measures adopted this morning relate exclusively to finance and in no way provide a long-term solution to the need for economic integration. This morning, the Council responded to the European banking, debt and euro crisis: that was a vital step. However, the lack of prospects for growth and the silence on economic convergence and employment allow some people to continue to speculate about how fragile we are. At a time when we should be carrying out structural reforms to invest in and kick-start growth, we are recommended to opt for the ‘Euro Plus Pact’. We do not accept that. Let us not replace excessive dependency on the market by dependency on competitor nations which do not comply either with social or environmental standards. The second reservation: budgetary authoritarianism, which adds enforcement to austerity. In point of fact, we face two crucial tasks today: to clean up our public finances and to kick-start growth. The balance between these two must be a political choice. It flows from a decision that we make for the people of Europe that we represent. The Court of Justice should not be a substitute for political will and our duty to show solidarity. We must not revise the treaty under pressure from speculators. The choice of further integration is our political duty, and that of this Parliament. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission needs to prove today that the industrial policy it stands for is not an empty promise. As has already been said, we cannot accept that economically viable sites equipped with high-performance tools and skilled employees may be shut down because of a cynical calculation of profits. As far as the Florange site is concerned, I call on the Commission to speed up its selection process for the NER 300 programme, because we must examine all the other options for maintaining activity on European soil. Indeed, this site brings together, under the Ultra-Low Carbon dioxide (CO2
) Steelmaking (ULCOS) programme, all the elements needed to set up a pilot project in the field of CO2
 capture and storage, thereby striking a difficult balance between heavy industry and environmental protection. The fact is, the more blast furnaces are shut down for the long term, the more it will cost to start them back up again, and the greater the risk of this project failing, which would be catastrophic not only for the Lorraine steelmaking area but also, on a wider scale, for all the regions in Europe that are interested in reproducing this kind of equipment. The European Union was born out of steel and steelmaking. We cannot let it disintegrate and perish because of a financial crisis and because of the demise of steelmaking, for the sake of our jobs, our regions and our workers. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, unlike the French Government, I sincerely hope we will have a major public debate. We need comprehensive stress tests. Fukushima has shown that we must imagine the unimaginable. The method currently used fails to take into account risks such as terrorist attacks or plane crashes, and therefore does not meet this requirement. We need a transparent debate, because the choice whether to continue or stop must be based on broad public consensus that is informed but not bypassed by expert discussions. We need an independent debate in the presence of all parties, so as to avoid potential conflicts of interest and promote appeasement. Finally, I am from Alsace and therefore know the extent to which the Fessenheim nuclear power plant concerns our German and Swiss neighbours. Instead of establishing full national control over these issues, why not at least encourage a sharing of expertise between our security agencies? Security would benefit, as would transparency and citizenship at European level. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this very fine report by our fellow Member, Mr Audy, summarises all our discussions with the operators in the sector. I am not going to go over their assessment of our Seventh Framework Programme: that it is indispensable but too complicated and too bureaucratic. I would just like to emphasise two points. Firstly, innovation. Parliament has pledged to promote it, but it must not do so at the expense of fundamental research. As we well know, the main result of research is knowledge, followed by the opportunity to enhance that result in the economic sector, or indeed the industrial sector. A clear distinction must be made, then, between the manipulation and the enhancement of fundamental research. Secondly, financing. We all agree that the budget should match our ambitions. I would go so far as to say that, on this issue, we should be innovative by being consistent. It is pointless bringing in more instruments; let us make the existing ones more effective. In this respect, the risk-sharing finance facility is a real success, but it must take a more inclusive approach to SMEs and research infrastructure. I therefore call on the Commission to do everything in its power to solve the disputes as quickly as possible and to take into account the courses of action proposed in this report. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we set ourselves the objective of strengthening our capacity for innovation and investment or the competitive advantage to be found with the United States and China, we speak of economic development, certainly, but specifically, we also speak of creating jobs. For that reason, we must give ourselves the means to strengthen innovation. I would like to congratulate Mrs Merkies on the one-stop shop, the funding strategy, and the recognition of necessary risk-taking by researchers. Her report points in the right direction and proposes a context that is favourable to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are essential to the success of the European Union. Innovation means attractiveness and competitiveness of the territories, and the involvement of the regional and local authorities is essential in terms of committing appropriations, reducing disparities and enhancing the active role that citizens must play. It is directly on the ground that the measure proposed in this report will contribute effectively to the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives. Catherine Trautmann,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fishermen have told us that it is becoming harder for them to make a living from their work. On top of the particularly painful situation for them of a reduction in fishing quotas and plans for exit from the fleet, there is now the added problem of soaring oil prices. Although the price has fallen slightly, it continues to fluctuate, and for two years now, this situation has been affecting the daily lives of all our European fishermen, in particular, in the small-scale and coastal fishing sector. This situation is extremely worrying, and we are anxious to show fishermen that we are fully behind them. To do so, we call on the European Commission to raise the threshold of de minimis
 aid that can be granted to them to help them cope with this crisis. This is simply a temporary measure, justified by an urgent situation. The Commission already reacted to a similar phenomenon in 2007, and in the face of this new peak, we wish to know what concrete measures – you have already given details of some of them – it intends to take. We also feel it is crucial, as Mrs Fraga Estévez said, to verify that the Member States are using all of the funds currently set aside by the regulation. At a time when the future common fisheries policy appears to be taking shape, I believe that our fishermen are not resistant to change; quite the contrary. Many of them told me that they were willing to make an effort, particularly in terms of preserving stocks. This is, in fact, a collective responsibility. In order to make that effort, they must not fall victim to factors outside their work over which they have absolutely no control. A swift and effective response by you, Commissioner, on this point would send a signal that would also help strengthen what we know are historically fragile links between the Commission and the profession. Catherine Trautmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to give our verdict at first reading on the draft radio spectrum policy programme, and I should like to thank the Commission for having supported and transformed this proposal, which was first tabled during our debates on the telecoms package. I should also like to commend our rapporteur, Mr Hökmark, as well as my fellow shadow rapporteurs, for our good cooperation on a report which reveals some major political issues hidden behind its highly technical aspects. We have had numerous debates, which have really made me see that Parliament and the Commission do, quite naturally, share the same opinion and ambition. The opinion is that spectrum is a scarce resource that does not recognise borders. Everyone seems to agree on this point. However, it is on the solutions to be found to improve its management and on the general ambition that some differences can be observed, in particular with the Member States, which I do not deny have historically had a certain sovereign responsibility. Although not all the compromises tabled and adopted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy are as balanced as I personally would have liked, I support very sincerely the general move to develop a spectrum management approach that is more integrated, realistic and responsive to the social, cultural and economic needs of our fellow citizens. This is a common thread in all the positions adopted by our Parliament, Commissioner, be it on the own-initiative report by my colleague, Mrs Toia, or on the proposals that I myself defended as one of the rapporteurs for the telecoms package. With regard to the radio spectrum policy programme, my group and I placed particular emphasis on several points in our amendments. They include, therefore, introducing transparency so as to learn how spectrum is currently allocated and managed – that is, the inventory principle – and also finding innovative and original solutions to the electronic communications sector’s growing demand for use of frequencies. They need to be qualitative, not just quantitative, solutions. By emphasising spectral efficiency, we will remedy this situation without limiting the diversity of services available on the spectrum. In doing so, we are also using spectrum as a vehicle for bridging the digital divide and developing new services that are within the reach not only of large telecommunications companies but also of SMEs and start-ups, which will need them. I believe that this economic dimension is essential. To conclude, I should like to say a few words about the next stage. As you said yourself, it was clear from the start that a first-reading agreement was out of the question, but it is imperative that we reach an agreement by the end of the year. This is essential for our public services, for meeting consumers’ expectations, and for developing the Internet regardless of the infrastructure in place. It is also essential for planning the economic recovery of our European Union thanks to this resource. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, nuclear power is a non-carbon energy source, but also a transitional energy source which depends on exhaustible resources. It is also a potentially dangerous form of energy. The obvious priority, after Fukushima, is to take a view on the safety of our power stations. These stress tests must be carried out in the most coordinated way possible at Union level, and potentially beyond in our immediate neighbourhood, by independent entities working in accordance with the strictest standards and with the greatest transparency. Next, the fight against climate change requires a coherent and ambitious policy. While nuclear power means that we can emit less CO2
 into the atmosphere to produce the electricity we need, we must not be dependent on it. In countries such as France which produce nuclear power, reducing its share is a precondition for any far-reaching decision. This process means that we must redouble our efforts when it comes to saving energy and increasing the share of renewables, which, in the medium and long-term, will be able to cover almost all of our consumption. This is about the safety of power stations, but it must also be about the security of provision throughout the European Union, so that no country finds itself in economic difficulty. Finally, true solidarity requires the creation of an Energy Community. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, I thank my fellow Member, Mr Rübig, for asking this question. I think that, actually, the French regulator is independent – his proposals are testament to that. I think that, given the logic of what I mentioned concerning the European Energy Community, we should have an independent regulator at European level and make available the supervisory means to ensure that the regulator’s work is independent and that the regulator is genuinely competent. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Mr President, at national level, it is always possible to question the composition and, from this point of view, I agree with Mrs Lepage’s comment. I think that we will soon see a period in which pluralism can be better ensured, but in any case, I would not want to question the honesty of the work by those people who have taken up their task conscientiously, and one person in particular, Mr Lacoste. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, I would like to thank Bernd Lange for his excellent work. Tomorrow, his collaborative method will be crowned with success. Moreover, Commissioner, this is an opportunity for the Commission, which provided us with a rather disappointing communication. As someone who hails from a large region heavily hit by the crisis, when it had already been affected by industrial restructuring, I have listened to the message of the unions, which have constantly challenged us. We need an industrial policy, all of whose components work towards the same goal: constructing a strategy that is based on sustainable, employment-centred growth that is built around the optimisation of skills and which shows that social and technological innovations are compatible with each other. That is the key to European competitiveness and not the use of the workforce as an adjustment variable, as the Commission proposed in the European semester. The best move the Commission could make is to rapidly integrate the Posting of Workers Directive into the work programme and to begin fiscal harmonisation starting with corporate taxation. Furthermore, this policy should take shape not only at national and European level, but also at local level in the context of an effective cohesion policy. Our choice is a regulated financial market, and we share the desire to consolidate the single market, but not at the expense of an inequitable labour market which is subject to social dumping. Today, Madam President, we are debating an ambitious industrial policy, and this morning, we voted on a tax on financial transactions, and on Eurobonds. Ladies and gentlemen, we must use these means to finance it. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).  
– (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment which is currently being examined by the Lithuanian Parliament and which would make it a punishable offence to publicly promote homosexuality, was drafted within the framework of a law for the protection of minors against the detrimental effects of public information. How can we, supposedly for the sake of protecting minors, undermine both freedom of expression and of information, and, above all, sanction discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation? We know very well that a text of this kind leads to concealing one’s sexual orientation and runs counter to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) rights which we have defended and which this Parliament has defended. Furthermore, at a time when we are witnessing acts of violence and aggression towards homosexuals, this is an incitement to criminalising homosexuality and a call for violence. We cannot give to young people an image of Europe as a society that is closed, intolerant, inward-looking and that disregards respect for other people. For us, therefore, this law is in complete contradiction with European values, as contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. As has been said, it also goes against the whole antidiscriminatory corpus of Union law, which has greatly contributed to making our national laws more egalitarian in many aspects of everyday life from employment to information or education. I thank you, Commissioner, for making a very clear statement, and I would like all groups to understand your argument as well as that of my fellow Members. I would like to call upon all fellow Members from all the political groups to join with the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&amp;D), the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), the Greens/European Free Alliance (Verts/ALE) and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL), who have taken the initiative in drafting this resolution. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

– (FR)
 Madam President, the euro is our common asset and, today, the trade unions told Parliament that they were concerned that employees themselves were paying the price for the crisis through a weak euro, a euro under attack and not through a growth-promoting, job-creating euro. It is therefore essential that we do not pursue a simple technical revision of the treaties and that the two major dysfunctions of the euro area revealed by the crisis are addressed. The first approach is to introduce eurobonds, as we have heard. Eurobonds will not only stabilise the level of the euro, they will also immediately counter the speculative attack. The second approach to introducing fiscal justice and to making the financial market pay the price for the crisis is precisely to introduce a tax on financial transactions so that it is not employees who, as a result of fiscal injustice, pay the price for this crisis. Finally, a European debt agency must be established, which must be able to pool some of the sovereign debt of the Member States. Finally, I would also like to support Mr Juncker and to say that increasing the stability fund, which was proposed by Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Director-General of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is a good idea. Early intervention – as we have heard – not being late and choosing to become strong and not weak would enable us to perform an act of governance that would re-introduce the confidence called for by our President, Martin Schultz. (Applause) Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 – (FR)
 Mr President, my group, in fact, wishes to see the two oral questions concerning both the report of the Van Rompuy task force and the six Commission legislative packages on economic governance reinstated in the order of business. Firstly, for an institutional reason, since Article 9 of the Treaty of Lisbon gives us this prerogative and this authority to have applied the horizontal social clause and, in particular, the study on the social impact for the sweeping measures, the sweeping directives and decisions that have consequences for our citizens. Mr John Monks, the General Secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, has just written about his concern at seeing austerity plans having a direct impact on the incomes of wage earners, their wages and also their pensions. The political reason for making this request, Mr President, on behalf of my group, is that we must show that, at a time when we are discussing market regulation, we are not only giving our verdict on the markets, but also voting and legislating in favour of our fellow citizens. I should like to see this House feel able to support the reinstatement of these oral questions. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, this work programme presents the recovery of growth and jobs, as well as economic regulation, as key to restoring confidence. That is true. Our model of economic development can no longer make do with strengthening the enforcement aspect of a Stability Pact that has continually shown its limitations. The recovery of growth must be centred on job creation throughout the Union in its entirety. We need to look at employment and social standards as indicators of economic power and, from that point of view, emphasise the need to put more thought into the European tax on financial transactions and into a greater coordination between the European Union and the European ministers for employment, as well as into the Union’s economic proposals. I support the Members who took the floor to highlight the importance of the directive on the posting of workers and on the services of general interest. I think that the European Union’s digital strategy is a crucial factor for this new economy. We should show more recognition of the Commission’s ambition on this point. With regard to citizenship, the Union should put the citizens back at the heart of the European project, and the increase in financial allocations should not only focus on security aspects, in particular, on managing migratory flows. Finally, I would end, Mr President, by saying that, in essence, this work programme for 2011 should be the very example of a policy that addresses in a positive way this temptation for nations to withdraw, which all our Member States are experiencing. I believe the European Commission has the power to change things. It can rely on a Parliament which will be a proactive force and will support it if it shows more ambition. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, the state of the Union for us today, in France, is that the citizens, the people, and also the streets are rumbling with discontent. Our fellow European citizens are experiencing an unprecedented crisis of confidence, and they have decided to march to the beat of refusal and demands, but also of hope. What is behind this is a failed proposal for reforming pensions, but not only this. What is at stake is getting older in a dignified manner. What is at stake is ensuring an intergenerational solidarity which allows the youngest people today also to live their working life, their professional life, with a pension from which they can benefit. On this very subject, Mr Barroso, the Commission published a Green Paper on the reform of pension systems which unleashed a wave of anxiety from the trade unions before the summer. The proposal that you have made to increase the retirement age seems unrealistic to me. It would be more useful if the Commission told us how we can make sure that workers are able to keep their jobs up to the legal retirement age. I would like to hear your proposals, and I would also like to hear some details on what you called the fiscal consolidation rather than the economic coordination of our Member States, which I think must be oriented towards social solidarity. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, I would like to congratulate our fellow Member Mr Cadec on his excellent work. The text put to the vote today marks a certain change in the way our institution views the concept of free trade. Without being protectionist, the line defended here may be described as less naïve. We all agree that European production is insufficient, and rather than immediately resorting to imports, we must first try to intensify our efforts to safeguard and regenerate stocks, including through the use of aquaculture, to ensure the sustainability of the sector and its jobs in the Union, as well as European fisheries that are less dependent on third countries. As for imports, we must guarantee that the European market in fishery and aquaculture products does not suffer unfair competition as a result of less strict health and social conditions and ludicrously low tariffs. That is why I favour a European label, in accordance with our standards, both environmental and social. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, you told us earlier that Europeans must be firm and united if they are to succeed at the G20, and that the European Union’s credibility on the international stage is at stake. However, what is at stake, above all, is the Union’s credibility in the eyes of its citizens, who expect it to be able to equip itself with credible instruments to exit the crisis. Firstly, I expected the conclusions of the European Council of 17 June to treat EU budgetary discipline, macro-economic surveillance and the regulation of financial services equally. It has to be said that this was not the case. Secondly, having clearly lacked internal solidarity in the face of the crisis, the European Union has a duty to lead the efforts to emerge from it. Let us be frank. Economic and monetary union is suffering from a structural fault, which creates an imbalance between monetary policy and economic policy, even though today, the euro accounts for 27% of the global reserves of central banks. That obliges the Member States and the Eurogroup to coordinate national economic policies. The euro must not be the symbol of high prices for our fellow citizens, and our duty today, at the end of these interim Councils, is no longer to simply reassure the markets. It is to reassure citizens of our ability to exit the crisis together. Thirdly, the tougher stance on budgetary discipline, at this time of crisis, must not aggravate the recession. We want evidence, evidence that the 2020 strategy will actually be accompanied by financial resources that are sufficient to develop, but also guide, the economy towards the spending of the future, towards employment and towards solid and fertile investments. Presidents, we must hear the warning being expressed today in anger and soon in fear. Identified as it is with unfair liberalism, the European Union must not become the symbol of brutal austerity. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, may I congratulate Mr Romeva i Rueda, who has managed to include the technical provisions resulting directly from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) meeting in Recife, as has already been said, while leaving open the possibility of adding further rules that might arise from forthcoming negotiations. This report also includes elements that will enable us to combat the phenomenon of illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing, and provides guidelines as regards stock regulation. I particularly support the report. Our vote is taking place at a fairly fraught time, following the European Commission’s decision last week to close purse seiner bluefin tuna fishing early. While a common ground appears to have been found – and for that I would like to acknowledge the step taken by Commissioner Damanaki, who reached an agreement with France, allocating additional quotas for small-scale and coastal fishing – there is still some doubt over the situation concerning purse seiners. The constraints faced by fishermen are very strict, and it is this kind of uncertainty that we must avoid, for our fishermen have to be sure they have a stable and level playing field. It is this objective of predictability that we will pursue in negotiations on the reform of the common fisheries policy. Predictability and sustainability must go together, particularly as regards decisions necessary for safeguarding stocks and the sector’s long-term future, as well as fishermen’s activity and income in the short term, with the objective being a fisheries sector that respects marine resources. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us say this clearly: the way in which the negotiations on the Anti­Counterfeiting Trade Agreement are being carried out is unacceptable to the European Parliament. As a new colegislator on this issue, the Treaty of Lisbon now guarantees us the right to full information at the same time as it is received by the Council. The documents that have ‘leaked out’ up to now have proved to us that, as far as form is concerned, this dimension absolutely was not respected. What can be said about the content? The fool’s bargain that seems to have been offered to Internet access providers is as follows: should they decide to cooperate in the systematic monitoring of the content carried on their networks, their current non­liability for such content would be maintained. Otherwise, they would be exposing themselves to legal actions by right holders and would be systematically penalised. I find such a turnaround extremely dangerous, as it would call into question the acquis communautaire
, not only on the principle of mere conduit – referred to in French as simple transport 
– in the e­Commerce Directive, but also in relation to respect for the fundamental rights of the citizens, which was brought up recently in our debate on the Telecoms package. I will conclude by reminding you that our Chamber has already shown its attachment to these principles by rejecting the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) Agreement. I have no doubt about its ability to start again. Therefore, I am anxious to stress the importance of the resolution that is being debated this evening. I welcome the work of our coordinator, Mr Arif, and of all of the negotiators from the Committee on International Trade, who have ensured that the signal that the European Parliament will give tomorrow will be extremely symbolic because it is unanimous. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Presidents, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, may I thank all the rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and for the huge task accomplished in spite of what were at times conflicting interests. The first result of our efforts is that Parliament can now state the direction in which it intends to steer the future common fisheries policy. The second result is that, during the negotiations, our priority was to ensure that this text responds to the concerns expressed by fishermen. We have succeeded in this: the provisions relating to transferable individual quotas have been withdrawn, and support for small-scale and coastal fishing has been maintained. The third anticipated result is that the forthcoming document must result in a participative and bottom-up approach, that is to say, in consultation with all those involved in the sector. It must also incorporate those elements that are essential to the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, notably, the human and social dimension of the entire sector, which must be combined effectively with the promotion of sustainable fishing practices and with the conservation of the fish stock as part of an ecosystemic approach. I would like to add that, if we want to succeed in an ambitious reform of the common fisheries policy, then we must devote a budget to it that matches our stated ambitions. Our political commitment will be judged according to the resources that we grant it. We expect the Commission … (The President cut off the speaker) Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Zapatero, thank you first of all, Mr Zapatero, for reintroducing ambition, political perspective and also energy, at a time when the European Union has to bounce back from the crisis and in the wake of the failure in Copenhagen. I expect the Commission and the Presidency to enable us to put the creation of more and higher quality jobs, the fight against social exclusion, and sustainable development at the heart of the 2020 strategy. This is true in particular for the agriculture budget, and also for the fisheries budget. You have committed yourself to this. Mr Zapatero, we are counting on you to provide the resources for this policy, to associate the decontamination of soil with food security, to create the conditions for green jobs and for the preservation of fisheries resources, to ensure food security and to create fairer trading conditions for the countries of the South. We need an ambitious agriculture budget, and I would also ask you to link the fisheries budget with this budget. On these points, our jobs, but also our policy, will be judged on the basis of the results achieved. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Presidents, Minister, the Swedish Presidency has had what may be described as some historic moments: the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the appointments of the first President of the European Council and of the High Representative, but also the climate change conference and the appointment of a new Commission, as well as – please allow me this brief reference – the telecoms package. These events have created hope. All things considered, however, there remain one or two mixed results. Firstly, our Parliament, being committed to the introduction of European supervision of the financial markets, welcomed the proposals made by Mr de Larosière’s group of wise men as a crucial step. However, the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council of 2 December are well below this realistic level of ambition. I wish to mention at this point that Parliament will be sure to restore some balance to the proposals that have been referred to it, in order to make the financial markets more robust. The same applies to the financial commitments pledged to the countries of the South to help them combat climate change. Even though, in Copenhagen, poor countries require real commitments concerning long-term financing, the Council has only managed to pledge EUR 7.2 billion over three years. This is a first step, true, but it falls far short of the requirements, all the more so since part of it comes from a restructuring exercise. Lastly, in the financial field, we welcome the will to impose rules and to act forcefully with regard to both supervision and taxation. I note in particular, in the Council conclusions, the reference to a global financial transaction levy. This is something for which we socialists have been hoping and praying for more than 10 years. There is still work to be done. Seeking out new financial resources to promote employment, solidarity within and outside Europe, and the financing of the fight against climate change, is a major challenge. As it will soon be Christmas, I invite the Council to give us a decision on own resources in the years to come. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, on Thursday the European Union appointed Mr Van Rompuy as its first permanent President of the Council and Mrs Ashton to be in charge of European diplomacy. Ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to return to the debate that has been taking place in our institutions since these appointments were announced. Indeed, in my opinion, beyond the issue of names and functions, there is the central issue of the States. Let me explain what I mean. We are witnessing what could be the worst nightmare of those who conveyed the ideal of the European Community and their desire for union. At that time, it was believed that the roots of the Union were to be found in state legitimacy and that its future lay in transcending national selfishness. Tension between two contradictory mediums, which is sometimes painful, often produces original mechanisms, but, above all, serves a political approach that is unique in the world. This nightmare, ladies and gentlemen, is that of a Europe that would be limited to a community of intergovernmental acquisitions. The result, as we can see today, would be suspicion of incompetence, presumption of illegitimacy and tension between political families. In making this speech, I do not intend, as you will have gathered, to return to making judgments on mere intent. I prefer to recall with you the rights and duties of we MEPs. Our duty is to question the impenetrable haggling that surrounds appointments to the posts that resulted from the Treaty of Lisbon. Our duty, in future, is to force the Council to put an end to this undemocratic, archaic method of appointment that fosters the idea that Europe, in building itself, is sheltered from the peoples. Our duty is to use all our new parliamentary prerogatives to influence the policies that will result from the new powers guaranteed to us under the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament, between a weakened Commission and a strengthened intergovernmental centre, needs to become the institutional point of equilibrium. On this matter, I hope that the Vice-President of the Commission will be subject to the same hearing process by the European Parliament as the other commissioners. Indeed, we have a right to carry out this process; it is conferred by the treaties. I also support the proposal of Mrs Harms, who has suggested a meeting between the new President and the groups as a whole. Our duty is to kick-start European integration, which is in a seriously bad way. No one can reasonably want the mandates entrusted to Mr Van Rompuy or Mrs Ashton to fail and, more especially, I wish Mrs Ashton every success because I am proud that a woman has been appointed to this post of High Representative. Catherine Trautmann,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we are once again – this time for the last time – to discuss the telecom package and, more specifically, my report on the ‘framework’, ‘access’ and ‘authorisation’ directives, which represents the final cornerstone. This is an opportunity for me to thank my colleagues, particularly my co-rapporteurs Pilar del Castillo and Malcolm Harbour; the chair of the Conciliation Committee, Mr Vidal-Quadras; the chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Herbert Reul, and all the services of the European Parliament that were involved. I also wish to thank the Commissioner for her involvement and support throughout this period, and I thank her services as well. Finally, I also welcome the efforts of the Swedish Presidency to reach a satisfying conclusion. Let us take a moment to remember Ulrika Barklund Larsson. Tomorrow’s vote will give a very positive signal to those expecting a more dynamic European industrial policy. As the second reading agreement on 99% of the text has been maintained, I shall just summarise the aspects that we made our priority. In particular, we wanted to maintain effective, lasting competition, but also to make that competition useful to economic and social development through complete coverage of European territory in terms of access, high speed internet for all and for all regions – including better management of radio spectrum – and full rights for consumers. This will involve establishing a consistent, operational framework for those who will be using these directives, that is, regulators, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications and the Commission; guaranteeing legal certainty; encouraging the investment needed to relaunch our economy and make the market dynamic for operators, their consumers and employees; and, finally, developing plenty of high-quality services that are accessible to the majority and fairly priced. It is important that we remain within the terms of the agreement and, unfortunately, recent statements made by certain Member States raise some doubt over their commitment on this matter. I shall support the Commission’s interpretation of the result of our negotiations over Article 19. As a matter of interest, the wording chosen for this article is closely linked to the debate on the mechanisms of Articles 7 and 7a. It would be disappointing if the Council, through non-binding declarations, put across the message that it somehow wanted to have its cake and eat it by denying a fair balance of powers between Member States, BEREC and the Commission, as emerged in the final compromise. Finally, of course, the salient point that led us to conciliation: Amendment 138. I would just like to say that the result obtained was the maximum that Parliament could obtain with the legal basis we had: harmonisation of the internal market. So this result must not be taken lightly, since it offers all users of electronic connections solid protection of their right to privacy, to presumption of innocence and to contradictory procedure, no matter what course of action they face and before any sanctions are adopted. I am also delighted by the Commission’s willingness to assess the situation of net neutrality in Europe and to make the appropriate instruments available to Parliament and the Council by the end of the year, based on the result of these observations. To conclude, I therefore ask everyone to think about the transposition of the package. I am already aware that Parliament, to which this package means a great deal, will make sure that the transposition is undertaken with respect for past agreements. Mr President, I will now listen carefully to my colleagues’ speeches before taking the floor again at the end of the debate. Catherine Trautmann,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, may I express my warmest thanks to my colleagues who have taken part in this debate and say that they have certainly made clear what a perilous and difficult job we have had to complete this telecom package. Ultimately, it was held up by an amendment on which we have resoundingly voted several times in this Parliament, but which was not accepted by the Council. Like others, I believe this to be a basis and not an end. We have not succeeded on this point as we have on others. In the Commissioner’s response, she also stressed the same thing about Article 19. I had hoped we would go much further in implementing a procedure of economic arbitration with regard to European regulators, but of course, we could not achieve everything at once. We tried to be efficient, fair and balanced; we wanted to show that, while the internet and digital society are driven by use and mobility, citizens’ rights should never be ridiculed, scorned or ignored. This is the first time that a text of this kind includes such a reference in its first article, making it a basic principle and linking the internet with the exercise of rights and fundamental freedoms; we believe this makes what we are doing quite distinctive when we legislate with the Council and draft texts with the Commission. Indeed, we think that the information society should be both respectful of citizens’ rights and positive from an economic and social point of view, opening up a new cultural sphere. That is why we anticipate that the market will enable this to happen, that users’ rights will be stated and guaranteed, but that we can also have this extended access and connectivity for all. However, this is also why we now have a considerable job to do in the areas of copyright, net neutrality and radio spectrum. The European Parliament will lend its support. I would like to say what a pleasure it has been to work with my colleagues and how delighted I am that this compromise respects the vote that we so strongly expressed together.

Madam President, Mr Barroso, I might as well say it straight away: you did not convince the French socialists for five years, and you are not succeeding in convincing us now with a project in which you are as generous in word as you are general in purpose. How can you say to us ‘vote for me if you want a Europe that is united in its diversity’, when it is precisely because we want this Europe that we are recommending waiting for the Irish vote so as to vote on your candidacy? Armed with the support of the Member States, you preferred to secure your appointment ahead of time and with fewer risks as regards the number of votes required. You thought that the passage before Parliament would be a mere formality: it is not so, and this is just the beginning, for your response does not meet the expectations of the citizens, who are suffering in the crisis and who have demonstrated their anger towards our institutions through their low turnout. You say that the crisis has changed you and you pose as the great navigator of a united Europe, but you have not been able to guide the Member States towards a truly European recovery plan, and we are still awaiting the concrete and binding measures needed for financial regulation. You claim to have given us guarantees regarding the social agenda, but all you are advocating is a new regulation, not a review of the Posting of Workers Directive. Moreover, you have not made a firm, and above all clear, commitment on a directive protecting public services. You show contempt for the MEPs’ memory of events. We have not forgotten that, over the last five years, social issues have never been at the heart of the proposed solutions, and it is only now that you are agreeing to a social impact study for each piece of European legislation. In a period of unprecedented crisis, which is destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs, everything must be done to ensure that the number of European unemployed workers or working poor does not reach 25 million by 2010. For this we need an industrial policy to be adopted. The citizens need to be set an example of solidarity in order to combat the crisis. Neither in your words nor in your declared ambition for Europe will they find this impetus today. To carry on as before is disastrous, said the philosopher, Walter Benjamin. You still have a very long way to go to win over the socialists and the social democrats. For the sake of political consistency and out of respect for our electorate, we shall not vote for you.

 We Socialists have always denounced the lack of transparency in the negotiations on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and our fight to refuse this agreement has steadily been gaining ground in Parliament, where five parliamentary committees have rejected it. There was therefore only one responsible answer that we could give to citizens regarding the ACTA: for Parliament to reject it in plenary. Despite the numerous delaying tactics by the right, and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in particular, that is exactly what we have done here today and I am delighted. Parliament therefore remains at the forefront of protecting the most stringent European standards on fundamental rights. I wish, in this respect, to acknowledge the work of my predecessor, Kader Arif. The ACTA was the worst possible response to what is a real problem: an agreement that has no effect in beating the scourge of counterfeiting, but, what is more, a potentially dangerous agreement for the fundamental freedoms of European citizens with its massive legal uncertainties. In addition, many other concerns were raised about neutrality, about open access to the Internet, about access to generic drugs or about the protection of geographical indications. Clearly, it did not come up to scratch. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

I voted against the Passenger Name Record (PNR) Agreement between the United States and the EU on the use and transfer of the name records of European passengers. I opposed this agreement as the negotiations in Parliament did not enable a compromise to be found on the necessary guarantees to protect the data of European passengers. Indeed, no provisions have been made to specify the purpose to which the data is put, which has been left too vague, to reduce the retention period of 15 years without, however, making provision for them to be deleted at a later date, and guarantees that the Member States concerned have given their consent if their nationals’ data are transferred to third countries`	.  The list of data to be transferred is also disproportionate leaving a great number of issues open, and does not make any provision for confidential treatment of sensitive data. Finally, it is a very rigid agreement, as judicial redress for Europeans in US courts is very limited, and no provision is made for the presence of the European Parliament and Member States in the review procedures for this agreement. I am not questioning the need to achieve transatlantic cooperation against terrorism, but rather the means chosen to achieve this, which run counter to the high data protection standards supported by the French Socialists.

 I voted for the report of the European Parliament on the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base. On the one hand, this report provides for harmonising the corporate tax base for companies at European level, that is taxable profits, and on the other hand, companies and groups of companies operating within the internal market will be able to add together the profits and losses of their own subsidiaries located in different Member States. The net profit will then be apportioned between these different states on the basis of a mathematical formula and pre-defined factors. The European Parliament spoke with a single voice, thanks to this text, in favour of the progressively obligatory nature of this Common Consolidated Tax Base, a major step forward in terms of adopting a political stance against fiscal dumping and relocations within Europe. An essential element in tackling this phenomenon is still lacking, however, insofar as no agreement has been reached, and that was not the aim of this directive, on the tax rates imposed by each Member State, which remain diverse. It is therefore progress in terms of politics, but is unlikely to be taken up by the Council. It is merely the first brick in the wall of a long struggle to regulate the European market.

 The European Parliament has been consulted on the reform of the system of taxation of energy products and electricity. While I voted in favour of Ms Lulling’s report, I believe that if it is to be understood and accepted by citizens, this change should take place gradually, bearing in mind the current socio-economic situation. Today, the cost of fuel is already a major expense for family incomes, and some families have consequently started to change their consumer habits. That is why I am opposed to the ‘proportionality’ principle between the different threshold levels applicable to each type of energy, which is likely to cause a very great increase in the cost of diesel, a widely-used fuel in France. Europe’s ecological objectives must not be achieved at the expense of the objectives of employment, competitiveness, and protection of consumers’ purchasing power, but must go hand in hand with these. Let us hope that the Council, the sole decision maker in fiscal matters, will listen to this message from the MEPs. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 At the end of 2011, the procedure for drawing up the 2012 budget was marked by deep rifts between Parliament and the Council concerning the financing of ITER, the thermonuclear fusion research project based at Cadarache in the Bouches-du-Rhône. EUR 750 million of cost overruns compared with the initial estimates had to be found for 2012 and only EUR 100 million had been agreed by the end of 2011. A compromise therefore had to be found for the remaining EUR 650 million. After long negotiations with the Council, Parliament succeeded in getting this money released by increasing the financial ceiling of the budget heading concerned, while the Council initially envisaged financing solely through the redeployment of funds from the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development. The additional financing needed for the ITER project in 2012 will therefore be available without the other research programmes being compromised. Along with all the Members of the European Parliament, I will nonetheless remain vigilant as to the sources of financing that will be mobilised in 2013 to cover the overrun that has already been announced. It is our duty to ensure that the ITER project will not be financed to the detriment of other priority policies of the EU 2020 strategy. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 While the debates on the future of the post-2014 cohesion policy have just begun in the European Parliament, which has been granted power of codecision on this matter under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament wanted to point out the specific nature of the outermost regions (ORs) – including the French overseas departments and territories – and the need to grant them adequate resources for their economic and social development. On account of their remoteness, their insularity and their extreme climatic conditions, these territories do actually need differential treatment, both for the viability of local agricultural and industrial production and for the successful implementation of the various EU programmes and remits. As such, the Commission’s proposal to halve the budget allocated to offset the additional costs on these territories is highly regrettable. What is more, I had proposed amendments on this subject in the opinion that the Committee on Budgets issued on the Teixeira report, and I had pointed out the need to include the accession of Mayotte to OR status in the 2014-2020 financial forecasts for these regions. In 2014, Mayotte will actually become the fifth outermost French territory recognised by the European Union. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 After 18 long months of negotiations with the Council, Parliament has finally been able to agree to the new regulation on over-the-counter derivatives. Traders are now required to clear these contracts through central counterparties and to report all derivatives, even those not negotiated over the counter. Moreover, the powers of intervention of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) have been increased in terms of settling disputes between national regulators. These decisions were considered essential in order to improve the transparency of the financial markets, given that derivatives had a large part to play in aggravating the volatility of the markets during the 2008 crisis. However, this is only a first step in regulating the financial sector: others, which Parliament could not support because of the Council’s opposition, will have to be examined in the future, in particular, enhancing the role of ESMA.

 While the debates on the general budget for the European Union for 2013 are already showing signs of becoming strained between Parliament and the Council, we, the MEPs, are in the process of drawing up the next operational budget for our institution. Aware of certain budgetary constraints, we have evaluated the change in our funding requirements at + 1.9% in comparison with 2012, an increase below the level of inflation. Some budget lines will be subject to freezing in order to achieve this target, such as Members’ allowances, transport costs, etc. Other areas will also need to be studied closely in order to avoid any overspending: this is the case for costs relating to building maintenance or the establishment of the House of European History. Over the course of the year, we will also need to be more vigilant about some additional necessary loans, such as those relating to the accession of Croatia, which have still not been included in the budget’s provisions. Parliament must be exemplary in establishing its budget to ensure that it has the means to fully guarantee its democratically received powers while controlling its spending within reasonable limits.

 Every year, the European Commission publishes a report on the state of gender equality in Europe. Unfortunately, the same findings recur every year: gender stereotyping, ancestral taboos and an outdated view of the division of roles between women and men persist, preventing any improvement in the circumstances of women in the European Union. In 2011, the crisis helped make the situation worse, since, in affecting women more severely than men, it undermined their economic independence. Employment, access to positions of political and economic responsibility, freedom and sexual health: all issues that still require a continuous struggle in order to achieve genuine gender equality. This also has to be a daily struggle, in everyday life as well as in the European Parliament, where, at every opportunity, almost one third of Members regrettably call into question the issue of access to contraception and abortion.

 By defining the general guidelines for the preparation of the 2013 budget, Parliament wanted to focus mainly on support for jobs (especially for young people) and SMEs. These priorities bear a strange resemblance to the priorities Parliament defined for the 2012 budget. Now, the difficulties of the latest budget negotiations are already putting in doubt the result of the discussions that are soon to take place on the drafting of the 2013 budget. Are the budget guidelines merely Parliament’s pious hopes? I fear so, as the negotiations have followed the same tragic route for two years: the draft budget from the Commission, supported by Parliament, undergoes cuts by the Council, which is more interested in reducing its contribution to the EU budget than in the budget’s added-value. This fool’s game has been played since Parliament failed to use its new powers of budgetary codecision to oppose the Council’s sterile wishes in 2010. 2012 will also be the year when the 2014-2020 financial framework is drafted. It will be difficult to prevent the Council’s short-term ‘in times of crisis’ vision from being applied to the definition of the ‘post-crisis’ financial perspectives. We must, however, support an ambitious position, for a Europe in line with the expectations of Europeans. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Mr President, we should, of course, be glad that the Member States have finally reached an agreement to ensure the immediate future of the European food aid programme for the most deprived citizens. This agreement was vital for millions of Europeans who have already been given a rough ride because of the crisis but it is far, far from enough. In fact, it is conditional upon the withdrawal of the Food Aid Programme in 2014, and on the will of the German Chancellor, a will that unfortunately is not upset, that Europe is no longer funding any social policy of this type beyond that date. We are Europe. We have core values and shared ideals that we support: peace, prosperity, of course, but also solidarity and the right to dignity, given that dignity is the opposite of humiliation … (The President asked the speaker to slow down) Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

The decision taken under the French Presidency to do away with quotas risked leaving milk producers without any safeguards in the case of market disturbances. We therefore welcome the ‘milk package’ proposal as a first step in the right direction. It was necessary to strengthen producers’ negotiating power in relation to the private processing industry by encouraging them to group together and promoting the use of contracts, which are only used for half of all production. My Socialist colleagues, especially Stéphane Le Foll, helped to improve the proposal by ensuring the future of milk production in vulnerable regions where cheeses with protected designations are made. There is still a great deal to do, however. In particular, it will be essential to shift the balance back towards livestock farming and provide other market tools in order to prevent any further crises in the milk sector. We must take the opportunity presented by the CAP reform to supplement this mechanism so as to guarantee farmers’ income and once again put them back where they belong at the heart of the food supply chain and food safety in Europe.

 Mr Fisas Ayxela’s report gave Parliament the opportunity to support the European Commission’s communication of 18 January 2011 on developing the European dimension in sport, this being the Commission’s first policy document on this subject since it became a Community responsibility. While I welcome the report’s commitment to reminding us of the key values that playing sport can convey and suggesting the type of actions that should reflect the Community added value in this field, I wonder about the EU’s current ability to effectively assume this responsibility. With only EUR 4 million specifically dedicated to sport each year (in the form of a ‘preparatory action’, in other words, a temporary action), the Union does not have the resources to effectively combat doping, to support sport for people with disabilities, to promote the development of a ‘European identity’ through sport, etc., an issue that must be addressed in the months ahead, when Member States are being asked to establish the EU budgetary framework for 2014-2020.

 Could Mr Gauzès specify the nature of the commitments made by Renault to Mr Bertrand, the relevant minister, which appear to him to be serious? Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 – (FR)
 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, led by my conscience and my sense of responsibility, I will vote against the French Government’s application for aid on behalf of Renault, and I will do so as an individual. Because, unlike other groups, Renault refused to take account of the situation of former, older, workers laid off in 2009 and soon left with nothing following the entry into force of the reform of the pension system. Because, with profits of more than EUR 3 billion in 2010, the Renault Group exploits the full potentialities of globalisation. Because I think that, at a time when everyone is being urged to tighten their belts, signing a blank cheque for EUR 24.5 million with no quid pro quo
 is outrageous. Because, finally, Commissioner, the training and support measures presented by the applicants as active back-to-work measures, the only ones eligible for funding under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) are, in fact, disconnected from any resumption-of-activity logic. This is not about salving our consciences by creating the illusion that we are supporting European industry. In the end, what counts is that we support the interests of the workers in the industry and the associated jobs. This is a case in which the EGF is being derailed, and we must draw the necessary conclusions in order to adapt it. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, we wish to table an oral amendment. After contact was made on numerous occasions, the management of Renault and the French Government have so far refused to take into account the situation of company workers who, in 2009, agreed to leave the company and are affected by the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) application and who, since then, have seen their rights eroded and their income reduced through the application of the reform of the French pension system. The amendment is as follows: Paragraph 2a: calls on Renault and the French Government to commit themselves formally to take the necessary legal and financial measures to restore all rights and pension benefits, while granting work exemption under equivalent conditions to workers whose pension benefits were affected by reforms having entered into force since their dismissal.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome the strengthening of the mandate for the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) as proposed in this report, and I would like to support this great need to deepen integration of maritime safety by giving the example of transnational cooperation in the English Channel, which is in decline. After 10 years of Franco-British cofinancing of an emergency tow vessel, the UK Government has now decided to stop funding the vessel as part of its cutbacks, thereby reducing the safety of that sea crossing, one of the busiest in the world, which is being hit hard by the impact of privatising these services and the lack of a shared vision. It is therefore vital that the national authorities responsible for transposing this legislation – primarily the national coastguard services – act in unison in order to guarantee the efficiency and durability of transnational actions. I therefore believe it is of utmost importance for EMSA to show concern for safety in the English Channel and coordinate the action taken by Member States in that area. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this report because the European Union must increase aid for its regions, particularly rural ones, in order to encourage economic recovery. We must therefore support the Commission’s proposal to temporarily increase the Union’s maximum cofinancing rate for EAFRD (European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development) programmes in struggling States that receive support from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (euro area) or the balance of payments facility for non-euro area Member States. The Commission’s proposal is nonetheless paradoxical since, at the same time, it claims to be in favour of the Franco-German proposal to suspend the payment of regional funds to struggling States in order to force them to put their public accounts in order. Penalising those States by suspending cohesion policy funds, while offering increased support for EAFRD programmes, amounts to arbitrary discrimination against non-agricultural areas. If it is to recover from the economic crisis, the European Union must lend its support to all of those regions that are struggling. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find it hard to celebrate the fact that we have reached an agreement with the Council on financing the extra cost of ITER. The point of these discussions (which muddied the negotiations on the budget) was not simply to find a solution for ITER. The main issue was, in fact, to deal with the underfunding of the European Union budget, which has become a structural problem to the extent that we are now in a position of questioning whether or not the EU has the capacity to honour its international commitments. The ITER project is yet another illustration of the fact that the EU budget is not adequate to meet either the EU’s ambitions or our strategies. The reason that ITER has become, and will continue to be, one of the greatest sources of ongoing tension between Parliament and the Council is that Member States are demanding ever more from the European Union on the project, but are not willing to bear the financial consequences. By tinkering around the edges, and proposing short term solutions for funding these increasingly costly major projects, Member States are jeopardising the Union’s capacity, from 2013 onwards, to afford the tasks for which it is responsible. For the period 2014 to 2020, by deciding to remove the ITER and GMES projects from the next financial framework, even though they were both established as research and development projects by a majority vote, the Commission is admitting that it is actually unable to guarantee that the financial resources will be there to meet our responsibilities. This is a serious admission of failure and incapacity. The Union does not have the wherewithal to abide by its international commitments, and yet research, innovation and energy are among the major aims of the 2020 strategy, along with employment, sustainable development and growth. Pitting these different priorities against each other is not the way to … (The President cut off the speaker) Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, this 2012 budget is the Council budget, to which the European Parliament has added a little spiritual something by ensuring the inclusion of a few priorities, but priorities in the form of commitment appropriations, which, Commissioner, will exacerbate the problem of amounts outstanding. The countercyclical development and growth targets have again been severely obstructed in the EU budget for 2012. Firstly, because competition between programmes, which is the consequence of cutting costs willy-nilly, has been given priority at the expense of structuring measures that would allow us to take an active role in overcoming the crisis. Secondly, because Member States are refusing to honour payments in a timely manner – despite being legally required to do so – and are therefore deterring project leaders from developing structural initiatives. Lastly, because the Council has refused to increase, among other things, the funding for financial supervisory authorities and to further the creation of a proper fund to manage farming crises, thereby turning a blind eye to the context in which this budget will have to be implemented. The Member States are therefore imposing austerity measures on the European Union, just as they have done for their own citizens. The current negotiations on this budget are merely the precursor to the impending negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework. It will be hard to resolve the apparent lack of confidence between the institutions, resulting, in particular, from the Council’s decision to question the figures provided by the Commission, which I am sure you appreciated, Commissioner, and the failure to comply with decisions that apply to both branches of the budgetary authority. Yet there are instruments in place for that purpose – I am referring to new own resources, which could put an end to the inevitable deadlock created by the antagonism between net contributors and net beneficiaries. There is now no time to waste. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 I voted for Ms Berès’s resolution as it is vitally important for the emergence of European economic governance to go hand in hand with greater democratic scrutiny. In order to deal with the major changes that will have to take place if it is to emerge from the crisis, the EU must ensure the strong democratic legitimacy of its decisions. This legitimacy can only be guaranteed with the European Parliament’s support and involvement in the annual drafting of the EU’s main economic policy guidelines. In particular, it is essential for Parliament to participate in the European Semester procedure, during which each of the 27 draft national budgets is assessed by the European Commission. Following this procedure, Parliament should have the chance to amend the macro-economic policy guidelines proposed to Member States. This democratic development also requires enhanced dialogue with the national parliaments and the social partners in order to support European economic policy coherence and guarantee that the EU 2020 objectives are taken into account. Finally, it is vital that the Treaties be revised only with the agreement and, where necessary, the involvement, of Parliament. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 The maritime area is changing. There are numerous challenges in this area, starting with the need for shared use. In particular, this means developing fishery-related jobs, which must be an objective of the common fisheries policy; strengthening maritime freight; harnessing the extraordinary industrial potential of offshore wind parks; and developing tourism activities. There can be no policy without a budget; we therefore need to ensure that the integrated maritime policy has its place in the future multiannual financial framework. However, I would say that, if this policy is to be a success, it is vital to get the Member States well and truly on board. This policy requires cross-sectoral but also transnational cooperation. However, in the Channel, transnational cooperation is waning. After 10 years of cofinancing an emergency tow vessel with France, the UK Government has now decided, as part of its cutbacks, to privatise its coastguard service, thereby reducing the safety of that sea crossing, one of the busiest in the world, which is being hit hard by the lack of a shared vision. An integrated maritime policy at European level must therefore be based on a synergy between national maritime policies, a synergy enhanced by a European ambition, which is itself equipped with adequate financial resources.

 I voted in favour of the report on illegal fishing at the global level, because its aim is beyond dispute. Illegal fishing unfairly competes with legal fishing and also often goes hand in hand with serious social conditions. There is no international framework today in which to share common standards. It is therefore vital for the European Union to become a proactive force in the bodies to which it belongs. During the forthcoming debates on the common fisheries policy, I will, however, be keeping a close eye on the issue of sanctions, which is raised in this report. Indeed, the resolution recommends withdrawing European subsidies for those who breach the rules. This proposal will need to be discussed with local players before it is taken any further. The entry into force of the point-based licence is also welcomed; I am unable to support this given the state of the current implementing arrangements. Furthermore, and in view of the UK Government’s recent decision to stop subsidising safety in the Channel, I made sure that it was spelt out in the report that the Union needs to improve its own operations, in particular, by creating a European coastguard, so as to ensure that our actions are more coordinated and effective.

 The report on the European platform against poverty and social exclusion, submitted by Frédéric Daerden, highlights a depressing paradox: whilst 116 million Europeans are threatened with poverty and 42 million of them are experiencing extreme material deprivation, the EU 2020 strategy only sets a target of 20 million in terms of reducing the number of people threatened by poverty. Is this an acknowledgement of weakness or an admission of the abandonment of the principle of solidarity, one of the Union’s founding values? Unfortunately, it can be seen in this way, given the ‘solution’ for the Food Distribution Programme for the Most Deprived Persons of the Community: it will be safeguarded for 2012 and 2013, but with unacceptable conditions, namely, the definitive scrapping of this programme and the abandonment of any EU-level social policy from 2014. This proposal is a provocation at a time when citizens are sorely affected by the crisis and austerity plans. It threatens to reinforce the impression of economic, social and moral regression. This is why, out of respect for the idea of a progressive, supportive Europe, we must continue to rally round this programme: for my part, I shall be paying particular attention during the negotiations on the financial perspectives after 2013.

 Mr President, for the second year running we are in a no-win situation, as the Commission – correct me if I am wrong, Commissioner – has produced a budget proposal that will barely be enough to implement the programmes we have undertaken, and will certainly not develop them or take on board the powers of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Council is clinging to its austerity dogma, and arbitrarily deciding on cuts to programmes that are extremely important in the light of the economic and social climate. Our proposal seeks to mobilise the EU budget to work towards the Europe 2020 strategy goals, and places the emphasis on programmes for research, employment, competitiveness, cohesion and public investment. It is a cohesive position, and one which we owe to the strong commitment of our rapporteur, Ms Balzani. We owe her our thanks for this. The EU budget is underfunded, due to the squeeze by Member States whose only goals are austerity, reducing public expenditure, punishing the regions – I am referring to macroeconomic conditionality – and punishing citizens, starting with the most deprived among them. I am referring to the deplorably sad fate that the Council intends to mete out to the European food aid scheme for the most deprived. If we take an honest look at the situation, at present we have no own resources, no Eurobonds, a predominantly intergovernmental method, a budget that is derisory, as this discussion also seems to be, considering the stakes at play in the European Summit and the billions that Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy are waving about to reassure the financial markets.

 I abstained on this resolution because, as the Commission has confirmed to us, referral to the Court of Justice of the European Union would block the parliamentary consent procedure, when the period of validity of the Protocol to the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco is due to expire at the end of February. In order to prevent Parliament, which unfortunately has been consulted far too late, from having its decision-making powers blocked, I chose to abstain by taking the view that the debate should focus not on this resolution but on the Protocol. Furthermore, since the fishermen are already fishing off the Moroccan coast, Parliament’s vote will only have a retroactive effect. If we want to obtain proper guarantees from the Commission and the Moroccan Government regarding the benefits of these activities for all the populations concerned and regarding the economic importance that they represent for the EU, then it is on the future agreement, which will replace the previous agreement from February onwards, that we will have to focus all our efforts. I am confident that the Commission will be able to negotiate a new agreement that lives up to expectations and that it will involve Parliament, so that it is not in danger of having its powers blocked again.

 Along with the majority of members in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I voted against four of the six reports from the economic governance package. I voted in favour of the report on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances and abstained on the report on the enforcement measures to correct macroeconomic imbalances. Most of the new measures, which follow multiple negotiations conducted in Brussels, merely impose austerity on citizens without taking account of the economic recovery that we need if we are to get back on the path to growth and employment. The Ferreira report was alone in offering persuasive solutions in this area. Indeed, this report provides for the guaranteed protection of social rights and the introduction of a very wide range of economic indicators which allow the situation in each country to be properly taken into account. It also advocates a symmetrical approach, pointing the finger at those Member States with huge trade surpluses as being responsible for developing macroeconomic imbalances. I abstained on the Haglund report, although I do not agree with its punitive content, as it had to be adopted if the measures advocated in the Ferreira report were to be implemented.

 Mr President, the European Council of Ministers for Agriculture failed to oppose a reduction of 75% in food aid to the most deprived. Seventy-five per cent! What we see on the ground is that the blocking of this programme by a minority of Member States arouses outrage, incomprehension and exasperation among members of the public, charities and their volunteers and, of course, beneficiaries. This situation undermines the credibility and image of the Union. Our citizens are aware that Europe is devoting a great deal of energy and resources to reassuring the markets, as demonstrated in the speech given by Mr Barroso this morning, and that it is mobilising less and less to come to the aid of the populations hardest hit by the crisis. That gives rise to a feeling of injustice and mistrust of the European institutions, which is potentially explosive, socially and democratically. Commissioner, as you said, Parliament has taken its responsibilities seriously, as has the Commission. It is now up to the Member States, including France, whose leaders are shedding crocodile tears over this programme, to reach agreement. If they so wish – as you said, Commissioner, it is matter of political will – on Monday this matter will be closed in the Council of Ministers for Employment and Social Affairs. It should never have been opened out of solidarity and respect for the beneficiaries. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy market integrity and transparency. The regulation lays down new rules that are designed to stop abusive practices in the wholesale energy markets, among other means by giving more powers to monitor and impose penalties to the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), which was set up in 2009. Considering that at present one of the main objectives of EU energy policy is to complete the establishment of the internal gas and electricity market, and that research and investment are concentrating on developing trans-European energy networks, it is extremely important for this new market to be governed by rules that will protect consumers. We can also expect energy trading between Member States to increase over the next few years. The research currently being done in the North Sea on creating a network capable of transporting offshore wind energy is just one example of what is needed for the future. It will therefore be beneficial to provide an appropriate legislative framework for this new market, so that it can develop properly and expand within a clearly defined legal framework.

 I voted in favour of the review of the Regulation on the Frontex Agency because it was vital to clarify its role and responsibilities while ensuring that it respects migrants’ fundamental rights when carrying out its operations. The need for this review has become even more obvious in the light of the Arab revolutions and the migratory movements that have followed. I therefore welcome several of the proposed amendments, such as the establishment of a consultative forum, which will exercise greater control over Frontex’s activities, and the requirement for the agency to undertake rescue at sea during humanitarian emergencies, or face the suspension of its operations. The possibility that the agency will not have to depend any more on the Member States, by acquiring its equipment itself, together with the increased information given to Parliament, are amendments that will help to clarify the link between Frontex and political decisions. One aspect that has particularly caught my attention is the creation, thanks to this regulation, of the status of European border guards. This development, which is only terminological at present, is an innovation that may, we hope, have a bearing on other groups of professionals requiring the same coordination, such as the coastguards of the various Member States, for example.

 I voted in favour of the report by the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis, as drafted by my colleague, Pervenche Berès, as it proposes ambitious yet practical solutions to help the EU come out of the financial, economic and social crisis from which European citizens are suffering on a daily basis. It is only by implementing Europe-wide solutions, such as issuing Eurobonds, which will enable more effective management of sovereign debt, greater investment in education, research and vocational education and the establishment of sound, effective economic governance, that Europe will be able to come out of this crisis for good. In its report by the Special Committee on Policy Challenges of 8 June 2011, Parliament called for EU budget resources to match the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. However, this message was regrettably not repeated in the final version of the Crisis Committee’s report. If we are to implement the Europe 2020 strategy, boost Europe’s economy and promote employment, we will certainly need a substantial increase in the EU budget over the next few years.

 Mr President, I should like to thank our rapporteur and praise the quality of the draft text of this mandate for the trialogue, which stresses the urgency of finally mobilising the annual budgets for the benefit of the Europe 2020 strategy and in a way that is consistent with the European semester approach. Nevertheless, the negotiations promise to be difficult, since the Commission’s guiding principle is to satisfy, by presenting a squeezed budget, the austerity requirements imposed by the Member States, while ignoring citizens’ needs. In this respect, the fate awaiting the food aid programmes targeting the most impoverished populations is symptomatic. Like many of my fellow Members, Commissioner, I was informed by the press that the European Commission is planning to drastically cut funding for the Most Deprived Persons (MDP) programme. Thus, it would be divided by four, from 500 million this year to only 113 million next year. The Union currently spends EUR 1 per capita and per year to defend the fundamental principle of these citizens’ right to food, in a rationale of European solidarity. The scrapping of this symbolic euro on the altar of national self-interests and budgetary austerity illustrates Europe’s moral and political failure. It is often said that the level of development of a human society can be measured by how it cares for its most vulnerable and deprived members. To cite technical and legal difficulties as an excuse for dismantling this food aid programme is disastrous not only for the people concerned but also for Europe’s credibility and image. The Commission is making fools of MEPs and the citizens they represent by proposing amounts in April and then dividing them by four two months later. Commissioner, I hope that you will change your mind on this particular decision, and that you will not remain deaf to the political objectives and budgetary intentions thereof which are expressed in this mandate for the trialogue.

 I voted in favour of this report on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste to send a clear message to the Member States: polluters must be held responsible for their waste. Indeed, whether it is a question of waste resulting from activities relating to the production of electricity or activities in other areas such as medicine, research and industry, the export of radioactive waste to third countries is an irresponsible practice that has been condemned by Parliament in adopting this report. Despite the success of this vote, given the cross-border implications for the safety and health of European citizens, I regret the minor role that Parliament has been given in nuclear matters as it has only a consultative role in this matter. Thanks to an amendment brought by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, this report underlines the need to find a new legal basis for legislation in nuclear matters in order for the interests of European citizens to be better represented on issues that are of such direct concern to them.

 Mr President, the debate on the European Union’s financial perspective raises questions about the European project, its scope and its ambition. This report is laudable because it seeks to mobilise the Union’s budgetary resources in order to comply with the Europe 2020 strategy. This puts it at odds with the narrow vision of most Member States. Whereas Member States see Europe in terms of their financial contribution, which they want to see reduced, and the financial returns, which they want to see increased, this report argues in favour of strong and integrated Community policies, be they long-established policies or new competences under the Treaty of Lisbon. Consequently, this own-initiative report by Parliament should form the basis for future discussions, even if, in my view, it does err on the side of consensus and caution. It is true that a 5% increase in the European budget would be better than the Member States’ budgetary plans for 2012. However, the crux of the matter – and probably the stumbling block – will be agreeing a figure that tallies with the policies described in the report. We are aware of the downsides of austerity policies: how they affect employment and have left growing numbers of citizens despairing. We have a responsibility to finance countercyclical policies, not least through a strong cohesion policy, Mr Pieper, which promotes public investment and employment in all European regions. I would like to stress the importance of creating an intermediate regions category to ensure that the allocation of Structural Funds accurately reflects economic and social realities in the regions. Let me conclude by saying that we need to impose a tax on financial speculation, which would increase our citizens’ support for a well-financed Europe. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 With the adoption of the Garriga report on the political and budgetary challenges facing the European Union after 2013, Parliament is anticipating, much too timidly in my view, the debate to come on the future financial prospects of the Union. This report reiterates its opposition to pitting against each other the different policies that fall within EU competence and insists on the need to mobilise sufficient funds, consistent with the EU 2020 strategy. It sends a clear message to Member States: we intend to support strong integrated policies and to do this by increasing the budget by at least 5%. Furthermore, in a context where citizens are subjected to austerity, we must maintain a strong cohesion policy. That is what we propose in this report, with support for the plan to create an intermediate category of regions, which will enable a distribution of Structural Funds that is more in accordance with the real economic and social situations of our territories. Finally, the Union must grant itself financial resources that match its ambitions. We have therefore reiterated our desire to introduce a tax on financial transactions, a project which is widely supported by the public and which would encourage greater support on their part for the European project.

 This resolution was adopted following the proposal by the Commission aimed at opening the negotiations on renewing the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Mauritania. Voting in favour of a resolution is unfortunately the only thing Parliament can do to be heard in the negotiations of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA). At present, Parliament can only have its say once the negotiations have ended, which leaves it no other option than to either approve these agreements or reject their ratification, thus leaving it very little room for manoeuvre. Now, the Treaties stipulate that Parliament be ‘immediately and fully informed at all stages of the procedure’. Hence, it is essential and legitimate that we ask to be associated with the European Commission and Council during these negotiations. This issue is not new and raises regular questioning of the European Commission by the members of the Committee on Fisheries. It is regrettable that we are not able to make binding our opinion on our priorities relating to the provision of European funds to the countries concerned, in spite of the fact that Parliament has the power to exercise financial control.

The adoption of a Parliament resolution on the European fisheries sector crisis due to the rise in oil prices is an opportunity for me to remind you how urgent it is for us to come to the aid of fishermen. In a context where recruitment is becoming more and more difficult, and where the practices that fishermen must adopt continue to become ever more restrictive, the increase in fuel prices makes conditions even more difficult in this crisis-hit sector. The substantial increase in oil prices is having a strong impact on fishermen’s operational costs, and this caused their revenue to fall between 2008 and 2010. As the elected representative of a port town, it is all the more incumbent on me to call on the Commission to authorise an increase in the ceiling of the de minimis
 aid. This measure would relieve the pressure on fishermen, thereby enabling them to make a decent living from their work without hindering the replenishment of stocks. The upcoming reform of the common fisheries policy will have to gain the support of fishermen. To show them today that the European Union is alert to their needs would be a good start.

 Following recent events which have highlighted the potential abuses of lobbying, it has appeared all the more necessary to increase transparency regarding the work of interest groups at the European institutions. The merging of the lists of lobbyists registered at the Parliament and the Commission represents a first step towards compiling an exhaustive register of the lobbies active in Brussels and, subsequently, towards greater citizen access to democratic checks and balances in the decision-making process. I have, however, fought to prevent the offices representing local authorities at the European institutions from being affected by this measure. Indeed, I consider these structures to be the direct product of democratically-elected bodies (town, departmental, regional councils, etc.). They represent the general interest, and should therefore be distinguished from lobbyists who defend individual interests. Furthermore, I hope that this register will develop to become mandatory one day, and include all lobbyists who are active at the European institutions. The notion of transparency is crucial to European Union policy and it must be extended to cover all interest groups that participate in its operation. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, EU fishermen are, as we know, confronted with three major problems: firstly, the very complex, unpopular quota system has forced them to adopt very restrictive practices. Secondly, the lack of training opportunities and the profession’s perceived loss of prestige are causing significant recruitment problems. Thirdly, and this is the issue we are discussing today, the rise in oil prices is making operating conditions in this crisis-hit sector even more difficult. Between 2008 and 2010, French fishermen, for example, lost EUR 100-200 in income per week as a result of fluctuating oil prices, even though their turnover remained the same. As an elected representative from a port town, I strongly support my fellow Members in demanding that the Commission authorise an increase in the de minimis
 aid ceilings. This measure would relieve the pressure on fishermen, thereby enabling them to make a decent living from their work. However, contrary to what has also been said, it would not affect the replenishment of stocks. The future reform of the common fisheries policy will have to seek the support of fishermen. To show them today, on Europe Day in particular, that the European Union is alert to their needs would already be a good start, Commissioner. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European food aid programme for the most deprived persons in the EU was urgently introduced during the exceptionally cold winter of 1986, then enshrined the following year in the common agricultural policy. This programme has become vital for 13 million Europeans who have little job security. It eases the strain on their food budget through distributions by charities and social services, and adds up to a mere EUR 1 per European per year in aid. Together with the Federation of Food Banks, Secours populaire
, the Red Cross and Restos du Coeur
 in France, I am concerned about the future of this programme after the European Court of Justice called into question its funding within the framework of the CAP. Our Parliament has often emphasised the fundamental nature of the right to food. Our institutions made 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. To cite legal ambiguity as an excuse for dismantling, as some Member States are trying to do, a food aid programme that has proved its worth would be disastrous not only for the people concerned but also for Europe’s credibility and image. That is why I call on the Commission to take the political measures necessary to safeguard, preserve and strengthen that programme. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 The parliamentary resolution on the lessons to be drawn from the nuclear accident in Japan contained some very positive points with regard to the safety of power plants, recommending, for example, ‘stress tests’ carried out in a coordinated manner at EU level by independent bodies working in accordance with the most exacting standards and completely transparently. Furthermore, like everyone else in the French socialist delegation, I supported the amendments in favour of a carefully planned and prepared phasing-out of nuclear power, reflecting the fight against global warming. That phasing-out of nuclear power will have to go hand in hand with increased investment in research and innovation, in order to reduce our energy dependence and increase the number of renewable forms of energy in the energy mix of the EU Member States. I did, however, vote against the motion as a whole, because it was merely a juxtaposition of viewpoints forming an inconsistent motion. After such a disastrous event as Fukushima, the question of the future of a sector as sensitive as nuclear energy requires more than a hastily put together resolution. We will now have to take the time necessary to organise a genuinely constructive debate, addressing all of the associated issues while enabling everyone to voice his or her opinion.

 I voted in favour of this report on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in support of the food industry employees (UNILEVER) in the Czech Republic. I would stress, however, that there is an urgent need to review the regulation of that fund as soon as possible. To this end, during the vote I co-signed and secured the adoption of an amendment specifying that it is detrimental for the regulation not to require an investigation into the financial health, possible tax evasion or state aid situation of multinationals which benefit from the intervention of the EGF. At a time when the European Union is struggling to finance its objectives and is obliged to choose between policies of equally high priority, the Community budget cannot afford to fund the market entry and relocation strategies of large multinational companies whose sole intention is to increase their profits. This must be taken into account in the forthcoming regulation, without prejudicing redundant workers by compromising their access to the EGF. Estelle Grelier,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their committed and constructive participation in the work done by the Committee on Fisheries on this report on transitional technical measures. The report has aroused lively debate, given the huge significance of the technical measures, as they will influence the way fishermen and the sector as a whole do their work, by setting out the methods fishermen may use to catch fish in the zones covered by this regulation, with a view to protecting juveniles and restoring stocks: an aim shared by all, and by fishermen in particular. The subject of this report is sensitive and controversial, as demonstrated by the difficulties the Commission has come up against since 2008 in trying to reach an agreement with the Council on the future of these measures. This was when only those two institutions were involved in the procedure. At present, technical measures are governed by an old regulation that was amended by a succession of transitional measures and then renewed until 30 June 2011 as no agreement was reached with the Council on the Commission’s 2008 proposal for a new regulation, which was aimed at simplifying and clarifying the existing legislation to ensure the rules were implemented more effectively and to cater for the fisheries’ regional features. Today, as the new deadline approaches the situation is radically different. Since the Treaty of Lisbon, for the most part the subject of fisheries now falls under the ordinary legislative procedure, whereby Parliament has an important part to play as co-legislator. It fully intends to play its part by bringing the fishermen’s points of view and those of EU policy-makers closer together. As an elected representative from a port town, I am always struck by how the fishing sector mistrusts and sees itself as remote from the common fisheries policy (CFP), whereas farmers for example clearly feel themselves to be more a part of the common agricultural policy. Added to this, the fishing sector is in crisis. There is growing dissatisfaction. The real challenge is the balance that must be found between the sector’s economic stability and hence the guarantee of decent incomes for fishermen and the sustainability and replenishment of fish stocks. Finally, the expiration of the regulation comes at a time when talks on the reform of the common fisheries policy are starting. This reform must adopt a bold framework and must get the fishing community, consumers and citizens on board. It must involve the whole sector in the scientific analyses that form the basis for the quotas and hence the sector’s level of activity. This new framework presupposes that the Commission will draw up a concrete proposal on the future technical measures, an effort which at present both it and the Council appear to have been saving themselves. The new proposal must make provision to ensure that the technical measures are in keeping with real experience on the ground, through consultation with those working in the sector. It must also be in keeping with the new regulation and the framework of the new CFP, especially on the subject of regional variations in measures. It must ensure that the division of jurisdiction between the Commission and Member States is clearly defined, a factor which will aid understanding and ownership of this EU policy. In the light of this background and these issues, I propose that we agree to the Commission’s request for an extension until 31 December 2012, without substantially changing the current technical measures except for the addition regarding the permissible mesh size for boarfish. However, I realise that this proposal is a form of concession to the Commission and that there are a lot of questions being asked and a strong demand for change in the sector, which is disappointed that this important project has been postponed. I am therefore adding a twofold demand to our approval: a request for an impact assessment on the technical measures currently in force, which is vital if we are to adapt them effectively, and a request for genuine consultation with all of the parties involved, especially fishermen themselves, in drawing up the new regulation. To conclude, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the Commission’s new proposal should be made within a reasonable timescale for a new regulation to come into force on 1 January 2013, which is when the new CFP comes into force. It is vital that the Commission begin work immediately on this new proposal. It would be unreasonable to allow a further extension after this new 18-month extension period for the current regulation. The technical measures to which my report relates are transitional and have only been approved as such. Estelle Grelier,

 Mr President, I will do my best to speak more slowly – I promise.  (FR)
 Mr President, I would like to thank my fellow Members for their generally favourable comments on this report, which also echo the debates that took place during the meetings in the Committee on Fisheries. I share the Commissioner’s standpoint on accepting the amendment specifying the mesh size for boarfish nets and on not agreeing to any specific requests for amendments to certain technical measures, on the grounds that they are not supported by any impact assessments for the vessels and the ecosystems concerned, or because the Member States have not sent the necessary scientific data. These measures are all interconnected and have not been evaluated. I would like to stress, as previous speakers have done this evening, the urgency for the Commission to carry out an evaluation of the current measures as quickly as possible and on the basis of this evaluation to draw up a new proposal that can be dealt with at the same time as the reform of the common fisheries policy, rather than after it. I wanted to draw your attention to this point, Commissioner, and I note your readiness to speed up the drafting of the proposal. To conclude, I must mention once again the importance of joint work between the EU institutions and the fisheries sector on gathering and sharing the scientific data. I believe this is a necessary basis for a new, fair and collaborative common fisheries policy which has sufficient resources – and that is an important point – and which reconciles the economic necessities and the sustainability of the sector in the interests of all: the fishing community, consumers and citizens.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Balzani, for the consistency of her draft resolution on the general guidelines for the 2012 budget. This resolution sends a clear political message. It is because it is fully aware of the budgetary constraints affecting the European Union that Parliament is today calling for the adoption of a 2012 budget that can respond to the political, economic and social challenges we currently face. At a time when the sole topic of discussion among the Member States is the implementation of additional austerity measures, Parliament, at least on this side of the House, intends to demonstrate its commitment to the thousands of workers who, today, are marching through the streets of Brussels to show their rejection of these economically questionable and socially unjust measures, the result of which will be a further increase in structural unemployment in Europe. The fact that the European budget is being aligned with the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy, in a clear way for the first time in 2012, means that employment and growth can be put back at the heart of European policies, which I would point out are our priorities, since the EU 2020 Strategy has set the objective of an employment rate of 75% of the working population. However, let us not delude ourselves. This budgetary procedure will be a long and difficult one, contrary to what Mr Lewandowski indicated in the French press when he anticipated the position of the MEPs. The Member States have already expressed their short-term view of the budget, which advocates discipline, and have called for a limit on their contribution to financing Community action. They see the European Union and its action not as a means to achieve added value or as a means to help it achieve ambitious policies, but rather as an additional cost. Let us not be mistaken. The 2012 budgetary procedure will provide another insight into the tactics being used to define the future multiannual financial framework. The fact is, with a budget which accounts for a mere 2% of the EU’s public expenditure, it will be difficult to pursue ambitious policies in all sectors. We are already seeing stormy debates on whether it will be the CAP or cohesion policy that will be plundered. This pits citizens against each other when it would be to our credit to help them work in synergy. That is why, Commissioner, I would reiterate the importance of your communication on the implementation of own resources. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Here we are at the start of a difficult negotiation between Member States on the 2012 budget while, in the background, the debate is already underway on the post-2013 financial perspectives. At this time of crisis, it will be necessary throughout the budgetary process to reiterate our expectations with regard to European policies. Unlike some Council members who consider the EU to be an additional cost, an expense to be reduced at the risk of pitting current and future policies against each other, Parliament, through the resolution on general guidelines for the preparation of the 2012 budget, has reiterated its vision of the Union as a vector of added value and an ally of Member States in implementing ambitious policies. Furthermore, I voted in favour of the resolution presented by Mrs Balzani because of its consistency and the clear political message it carries, calling for the adoption of a budget that is consistent with the objectives for employment and growth of the EU 2020 Strategy. Finally, I took advantage of the debate in plenary to challenge the Commissioner for Financial Programming and the Budget on the urgent need for a communication on the implementation of new own resources, which, I hope, will carry this debate forward.

 In the absence of other alternative solutions proposed by the Council, it was necessary to vote in favour of making the European stability mechanism permanent, in order to provide assistance to our Greek, Portuguese and Irish colleagues. However, the debate is far from over. This concession made by the French socialists is not an indicator of the outcome of other forthcoming debates on the economic governance issue. Faced with the introduction of this intergovernmental mechanism, it is important to move forward and implement instruments which will encourage recovery in growth and business. It is, among other things, to ensure that we are able to finance such instruments that I am campaigning alongside my socialist colleagues for an increase in the European Union’s own resources. We could also use the Structural Funds in conjunction with the European stability mechanism to make deficit countries converge upwards. It is with ambitious budgets and the promotion of a European social model that we will be able to emerge from the crisis. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 The adoption of a parliamentary resolution on the draft strategy for the Atlantic region is an opportunity for me to point out the urgent need to work at European level on a common approach regarding the use of our maritime areas and to find a joint solution to the problems that exist. The Channel is a particularly illuminating example in this respect: a strategic maritime gateway to the European Union, it is both an essential link between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea (it contains 20% of the world’s fleet and more than 500 vessels over 300 tonnes sail through it every day) and an area dedicated to fishing, leisure activities, aggregate extraction and soon – much to my satisfaction – energy production from offshore wind farms. This concentration of activities calls for serious thought to be given to the issue of managing maritime safety in that area at European level, as part of a joint strategy. That is why, during the debate on the strategy for the Atlantic region, I once again called on Mrs Damanaki, Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, to include the Channel in the proposal that she is due to submit in June.

 The adoption of the Podimata report was the chance for Parliament to show unequivocal support for the introduction of a tax on financial transactions at European level. Until now, the European right had always frustrated the proposals by the socialists on this matter, whether in parliamentary committees or in plenary sessions. The fact that a majority of MEPs, and hence a section of the right, have been won over by this project, which has been advocated for many years by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is good news. It shows that, together, we are gradually becoming aware of the merits of this project. This vote marks a new stage in the process of introducing a financial instrument that would serve, in particular, to generate additional own resources for the EU budget, but also to support development initiatives internationally. However, the fight is not over. For the time being, this is only a policy position. Beyond their statements, we must remain alert to the genuine willingness of European Heads of State or Government, a large majority of whom are right-of-centre, to introduce this tax.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted with these plans for an integrated strategy for the Atlantic region. We need a common approach to the uses of our maritime spaces that takes the specific features of each basin into consideration and finds joint solutions to the problems that exist. In particular, as an elected representative of Normandy, I would like to draw your attention to the specific situation of the Channel, which must also be incorporated into the plans for an integrated strategy for the Atlantic region. The Channel is one of the European Union’s strategic maritime gateways and is an essential link between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea. It contains 20% of the world’s fleet and more than 500 ships over 300 tonnes sail through it every day. On top of this transport activity, there are also fisheries, leisure activities, aggregate extraction and soon – much to my satisfaction – energy production from offshore wind farms. This concentration of activities calls for serious thought to be given to the issue of managing maritime safety at European level, which I feel must be discussed as part of the Atlantic strategy also. As you know, the bilateral bases on which funding for safety is based are currently under threat. I have already alerted you to this point Commissioner and I will be paying close attention to the proposals you will be making in June. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Adopted in 2006, the Services Directive, which should have been transposed into national law before 28 December 2009, continues to raise questions in the Member States and within local authorities that are directly affected by it. The parliamentary own-initiative report by Mrs Gebhardt, which proposes an initial assessment of the directive’s implementation, thus touches on some of these difficulties, and especially the uncertainty surrounding social services and services of general economic interest (how are they defined? which areas are affected?), as well as the lack of transparency of the transposition process in some Member States. Moreover, it must be said that France stands out due to its problematic lack of transparency and inflexibility in implementing this directive. It has scores of decrees and implementing laws, and a restrictive interpretation of the exemptions set out in the directive, which raises doubts as to the future of some services, such as childcare and care for the disabled. Now more than ever, this own-initiative report, which has been adopted by a large majority, is an opportunity to point out that MEPs, and especially the Socialists, will continue to be vigilant with regard to the implementation of this directive and its impact on public services.

The adoption of the Commission’s proposal for a regulation setting emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles seems to me, more than anything, to be a gamble on the future. The compromise reached on limiting average CO2
 emissions to 147 g/km by 2020 does not meet the initial ambitions of my fellow Members on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, who had previously advocated a decidedly more ambitious objective (135 g/km). They were supported in this by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. Behind this ‘battle of numbers’, however, there is a balance to be struck between the environmental challenges that everyone recognises and certain social and industrial requirements which must not be forgotten. That is why it seems appropriate to me that the compromise will be adopted only following the revision of the regulation by January 2013 and only following the feasibility study and reassessment of the objectives. Not only will this revision allow us to return to this subject quickly and to go further in the fight against vehicle pollution, but it will also be an opportunity to address the issue of EU research and innovation in the field of road haulage. The date is set for 2012. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Today’s adoption of the 2011 budget has highlighted the European Parliament’s double failure. The budget that it adopted is too small: +2.91%, which falls far short of its first reading (+6%) and of the Commission’s initial proposal (+5.8%). The amounts adopted are exactly the same as those proposed with no real room for the Council to negotiate, hardly reassuring in terms of the negotiability of future budgets. Ever since the Treaty of Lisbon was implemented, Parliament has acted with the Council in codecision on budgetary matters: by not getting any precise commitment to date on the role that we, as MEPs, will have in preparing the next financial framework and on providing the necessary reflection on new own resources, we run the risk of allowing the Council to become lord and master over the future of the European project. So, given the positioning of certain Member States, there is a real risk that this project will flounder. What dismays me the most is the attitude displayed by the European right as they were more than determined at the start of negotiations to drop out the minute the telephones began ringing from Heads of State or Government. Everyone will make their own mind up about the political consistency of such a reversal. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 In my view, the EU Solidarity Fund, like the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, is one of the budgetary tools that give the strongest practical expression to the ‘solidarity’ value that we Members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament strive to promote when drafting Community policies. On 27 and 28 February 2010, storm Xynthia killed 53 and injured around 80 in Vendée and Charente-Maritime. It was a genuinely traumatic experience for the region and the nation, and its psychological and economic impact is still being felt 10 months later. As from the March 2010 plenary session, Parliament took action, adopting by a very large majority a resolution calling for the fund to be used to provide assistance to the victims. Today’s vote, which confirmed the release of EUR 35.6 million for these departments, as well as EUR 31.2 million for Portugal, which suffered flooding in Madeira caused by this storm, is an example of this common desire to show true solidarity between European citizens. This is the Europe we wish to build, a Europe close to its citizens, alert to the issues affecting them, and capable of addressing those issues collectively. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

We have here a case of coincidental timing: Parliament has been asked to give its opinion today on six requests for European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) assistance that have been submitted by the Netherlands while, at the same time, the 2011 budget negotiations are stalling because of the refusal by the Netherlands and by two other Member States to engage in a responsible and constructive dialogue on the future of the European budget. Today’s votes are therefore, in my view, an opportunity to point out that the European budget is not just an accounting tool that everyone finds daunting: it is, first and foremost, the ‘power’ behind the European Union that enables it to work day in day out to protect its citizens, and particularly through the EGF, to protect unemployed workers. The vote on the allocation of EGF aid to the Dutch workers could have been used as a ‘protest vote’ against the Dutch Government, which is criticising on the one hand what it is benefiting from on the other. Instead, it has been an opportunity for Parliament to recall that the principle of solidarity must be the foundation on which all EU decisions are made. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, as a result of the austerity policy conducted by the Cameron government, the United Kingdom has just decided to stop funding the large tugboats designed to assist and rescue ships in the English Channel, a unilateral decision that has been condemned by the port, maritime, trading and political bodies of that area. The announced withdrawal of the United Kingdom could have tragic repercussions for the maritime safety of this sector, which, with more than 250 000 vessels a year, is the busiest trading route in the world. Over the last 10 years, nearly 300 incidents have been recorded there, and experts believe that the pre-positioning of high-powered salvage vessels has prevented a number of these incidents from turning into major accidents. Since maritime safety affects the safety of EU territory and the protection of the environment, emergency towing is the responsibility of the public authority, with the financial assistance of shipowners, and must not be privatised for the benefit of private towing companies. The European Commission therefore has a duty to take up this matter. Indeed, Europe must afford itself the resources to implement the major integrated maritime policy that it is officially calling for. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 As a Member for a port town in Normandy, and member of the Intergroup for Seas and Coastal Affairs, I have followed the report on the integrated maritime policy (IMP) closely. On various occasions, I have emphasised the need for ensuring harmonious cohabitation between the different uses of the sea, one that promotes traditional activities (such as fishing, and I asked for it to be placed top of the list of maritime activities included in the report, as a symbolic gesture), and one that also facilitates the development of new activities. Thus I noted that the sector of renewable energies, including off-shore wind energy, should be supported in particular, because it is in line with European objectives around the diversification of sources of energy supply, and can, between now and 2020, mean a gain of 410 000 jobs in Europe, according to a study by the Commission. Finally, with the rapporteur, I amended the report to apprise the Commission of the need to fund the IMP. The initial exchanges within the Committee on ‘policy challenges and budgetary resources for after 2013’, of which I am a member, indeed raised doubts about the long-term funding of the regional cohesion policy, some of the programmes of which relate to the IMP.

Once again, Parliament has been asked to validate payment of aid from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to employees made redundant as a result of the crisis or relocations. Once again, this aid will be spread across budgetary lines initially allocated to other European programmes, as the Globalisation Adjustment Fund does not have any funds of its own within the current financial framework. In order to put an end to this situation, I worked, during the drafting of the 2011 budget, on the creation of a line of payment appropriations specific to the Globalisation Adjustment Fund. The sum of EUR 50 million was therefore adopted by Parliament during the vote on its reading of the budget on 20 October 2010. This sum, which is symbolic compared with annual requirements, has yet to be confirmed, as the European Council initially rejected the proposal to give the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund its own financing. I shall therefore continue to keep an eye on this question, in the hope of achieving budgetary and legislative consolidation of this mechanism. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as our debate again shows, we are all in agreement on one thing: the more Europe enlarges, the greater the powers entrusted to it, the more it displays its ambitions and the fewer resources it has to bring them to fruition. So everyone agrees on the diagnosis, but clearly we are not in agreement about what we need to do to extricate ourselves from this financial deadlock. As what was short-term has lasted, the Union budget has become a prisoner of national contributions, which make up almost 75% of its resources. Today, if we decided to raise the expenditure ceiling to the maximum threshold allowed by the treaties, this would mean an additional levy of more than 5 billion for countries like France and Germany. Everyone here clearly agrees that this is not possible. It is not a question of stepping up discipline, as it is the people and, principally, the poorest people who pay the highest price for the consequences of these national austerity policies. Considering that the financial sector bears the main responsibility for the crisis and explosion in public debt, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament proposes that a line of ‘own resources’ should be created funded by a financial transactions tax; this proposal was rejected within the Committee on Budgets by the right, which may make up for it tomorrow and bring its actions into line with the numerous statements they have made to the media in favour of this measure. It is a little more than two years since the fall of Lehman Brothers, and Parliament must not pass up an historic opportunity to create the foundations for a new development model, based on more lasting resources and certainly ones that are more just in terms of redistribution of wealth and solidarity. For the first budget voted on under the Treaty of Lisbon, this would send a strong political signal from our Parliament, which does not intend to make do with using its new codecision powers to manage penury, that is, to choose which of Peter or Paul is to go without clothing. Giving oneself the means, starting tomorrow, to increase the size of the Union budget, is to give oneself the means to pursue ambitious economic recovery, research, industrial, and employment policies. Let us not fail to grasp this opportunity that European citizens expect of us and which, in any case, the financial operators are expecting of us. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

I voted for Mrs Matera’s report on mobilising the Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the workers of the clothing industry in Spain. As I said in September during the debate on the EGF’s future after 2013, I am disappointed that this fund, set up to support workers made redundant ‘for reasons of recession or globalisation’, is currently not financially guaranteed in the European budget. Indeed, I do not believe that tapping into the financial resources of other European programmes to finance the EGF is a viable solution in the long run. Therefore, when the Committee on Budgets voted for mobilising the EGF for the Spanish employees mentioned in the Matera report, I pointed out, along with the Belgian Socialist MEP Mr Daerden, the need to work towards defining a separate budget heading for this funding.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in brief, what does the European Commission’s proposal convey? First, a glaring lack of ambition. The Commission, supported by the Council, has refused to revise the multiannual financial framework, and has salved its conscience by proposing technical adjustments only – adjustments that were, in any case, inevitable, since they relate to the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon. Second, a breach of the undertakings given to Parliament. In fact, and this must be said, in 2006, Parliament accepted, albeit half-heartedly, what it had already, and quite rightly, understood to be an out-of-date financial framework, without room for manoeuvre; in short, one of resignation. It therefore made its support conditional on the guarantee of an in-depth overhaul of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) at the half-way stage. A fine demonstration of the lack of importance that the Commission and the Council attach to Parliament’s decisions, in paying no regard to them whatsoever – a Parliament, it must be remembered, that is sovereign and represents the people. Third, this proposal lays bare a paradox, namely one of increased powers, entrusted by the States to the Union, of large-scale projects, preferably European, within a budgetary framework that the Council and the Commission will not allow to evolve, even though they know it is not fit for purpose. They prefer to call on redeployment – a miracle cure in their eyes, but to mine, a narrow vision of the European project. What is more, how can we explain to the people of Europe without blushing that key projects are either not financed at all, such as the financial stabilisation mechanism, despite its heavy media coverage, or financed like the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), by tapping into heading 1a, which is intended for competitiveness, growth and employment, all policies meeting the public’s expectations? We are heading straight for the wall, while sounding the horn. Parliament knows it, and it is one of the virtues of the Böge report that it says so. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 I have supported this joint motion for a resolution because I am convinced that we urgently need to condemn the policy of the French Government, which has deliberately stigmatised an ethnic group by associating it directly with criminality, for the sole purpose of diverting attention away from the difficulties with its home affairs policy. This exploitation of the Roma issue is unacceptable in my view, and Parliament ought to react. Progressive Members, including the Social Democrats, have therefore demanded an end to this discriminatory rhetoric and to the collective expulsions, whereas the European right wing has largely supported the French Government in its drift to the right. We urgently need to implement a global strategy to tackle this subject, which affects 10-12 million EU citizens. This resolution deplores the lack of any reaction from the Commission, which is, however, supposed to be the guardian of the Treaties and as such should have condemned the French Government’s actions. The collective expulsions effectively make a mockery of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.

 I voted for the Portas Report. I support its main aim, which is to continue with the EGF, since, aside from the crisis we are going through, globalisation has a long-term adverse impact for our industrial jobs, which the European right refuses to accept. Furthermore, I helped amend this text so that SMEs and sub-contractors are taken into consideration when the EGF is allocated. Their employees are particularly vulnerable due to their dependence on multinationals, so it is vital that the EGF gives them real prospects for vocational retraining in the event of redundancy. I am also pleased that it has been recognised that studies need to be performed on the state bodies responsible for producing dossiers, so as to optimise utilisation of the EGF, which is often little-known and underused, particularly in France. Given that the European right has refused to continue the EGF after 2013, I will therefore fight in the debate on the next EU financial perspective for it to be kept permanently.

Madam President, Commissioner, it is a pity that the European budget, which should be a symbol of solidarity and the will to act together, has become a rigid tool, which the citizens do not understand and which lags behind the expectations of European society, incapable of being deployed to fight the social repercussions of the crisis. From this point of view, not a day passes without the media or a top-ranking politician talking about the need for a stronger European budget. Tension is increasing between revenue that is too modest, too dependent on the contributions of the Member States, and the money that the Union needs to spend in order to kick-start growth. For example, in the draft budget for 2011, the Commission simply presents a margin for manoeuvre of EUR 50 million to support new projects linked to employment and corporate competitiveness, which are top priorities. The revision of the financial framework is therefore a serious challenge for the future of the Union if we want to make it a real political and economic leader and also, and above all, a player that is closer to its citizens at a time when nearly 25 million of them are affected by unemployment. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Mr President, in essence, the vote on the budget is a profoundly political act, and we must learn a political lesson – a major, fundamental political lesson – from the budget being proposed to us. The European Union budget, and particularly this one, reflects the lack of a European political project even though, against a backdrop of crisis and at the start of our new mandates, European citizens need it more than ever. This budget marks the absence of a global vision for Europe. The Council and the Commission have chosen to let the Member States develop their own, often rival, recovery plans, and have abandoned efforts to coordinate an economic, social and environmental recovery at EU level. There has been no leverage attempt, no encouraging of European solidarity. The Council and the Commission are easing their consciences by applying a recovery plan bit by bit. Indeed, the 2010 budget provides funding for the second part of the recovery plan totalling EUR 5 billion, a derisory amount. Admittedly, it will allocate EUR 300 million to the milk fund, but this is insufficient when we know that in France, for example, the net income of farmers fell by 34% in 2009. The 2010 budget earmarks EUR 25 million for microfinance and, against the advice of the Council, allows the draft budget relating to Cohesion Fund interventions to be kept. It is therefore somewhat through the lack of an alternative and by default that we shall vote for this budget, because Europe – the citizens – cannot do without its interventions, however inadequate. Nevertheless, together, we must question – and this is urgent – the methods of financing the ambitious policies with which Europe must equip itself and of extracting the EU budget from its current restricted and unsuitable framework. Above and beyond major political declarations, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, must tell us how he intends to finance the future European policies about which he talks so much, particularly those relating to the new strategy on growth and to climate change. From now on they will be unable to make do with such a feeble budget as the one we are being offered. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, as an MEP from Normandy, I would like to draw the Commission’s and Parliament’s attention to the proposals on offshore Natura 2000 sites, which the French Government has just submitted to the European authorities. These proposals exclude the Antifer dyke situated near Etretat, but compensate for it by enlarging the perimeter to 12 nautical miles. This decision eases the way for Poweo to install a methane terminal at Antifer and restricts a project to create an offshore wind farm off Fécamp, despite the support shown for this project by local elected representatives, the population and even fishermen. A scientific and consistent proposal has been drafted for the region and has the backing of local operators. Under this proposal there will be six miles of zoning along the entire coastline, including Antifer. I have three questions: how much progress has the Commission made in examining the zoning proposals? Does it endorse them even though they go against scientific opinions and against the social, economic and cultural activities of the region? And, with the Copenhagen Summit approaching, can Europe reasonably endorse a decision that promotes gas at the expense of the development of renewable energies? Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 I voted against this appointment. France is preparing to make crucial progress on equal rights by adopting a law on marriage for all, at last joining several other Member States who have done the same. I believe that Tonio Borg’s appointment would contradict that progress in France and in Europe. His proposed portfolio – European Commissioner for Health – is fundamentally incompatible with his past statements and actions on contraception, abortion, and homosexual and transsexual rights. The holder of this position is meant to work for all European citizens, irrespective of their sex and their sexual orientation. Against a backdrop of particularly vicious comments and acts by extremists in France, appointing Tonio Borg would mean that Europe can accommodate such deviations. It is clear to all French Socialists that fundamental rights are not a matter for subsidiarity: they are universal. Irrespective of competence, this is an ethical matter: the European citizens have the right to expect Europe and the European Commissioners to defend these values without fail.

 In the opinion of the French Socialists, the national and European laws must be extremely strict, for example on extraction by hydraulic fracturing –the only type we are currently aware of – in order prevent any damage to the environment. It is not a question of denying the importance of energy independence and the effect of energy prices on the competitiveness of industry. Our priority must be to guarantee a high level of protection for human health and the environment. I regret that an amendment that I co-signed, calling for a European moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, did not obtain a majority today. Despite this setback, I welcome the action of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, which was crucial in ensuring the primacy of two particularly important principles: the precautionary principle and the ‘polluter pays’ principle.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to draw your attention to the case of Aurore Martin, the French citizen arrested in Spain and handed over to the Spanish authorities who is serving a 12-year prison sentence. Her crime consists in having participated in Spain in meetings of the Batasuna party, a party that is illegal in Spain but legal in France where it even has some elected representatives. She is the subject of a European arrest warrant that has been enforced. Although the establishment of the European arrest warrant in 2004 was greeted as the first step towards a European area of security and justice, today there are differences in its implementation that create inequalities between citizens of the European Union, and that is contrary to the very spirit of the framework decision establishing the European arrest warrant. Moreover, where there are important political implications, as in the case of this Basque activist, shouldn’t the European arrest warrant include broader exceptions and not be issued automatically so as to provide a better guarantee of fundamental rights, including the freedom of expression, which has been prejudiced in the case of Aurore Martin?

 Our votes have shown that the majority of Members did not favour transferable fishing concessions (TFCs) aimed at liberalising the fishing industry. The adopted text still, unfortunately, makes reference to TFCs, but they are now optional. A more watered-down position has also been adopted on the compulsory landing of discards; what is currently under consideration is a gradual implementation on a case-by-case basis, taking account of the different characteristics and realities of the fisheries. While the landing of all incidental catches and by-catches was to be approved in the basic regulation, we have also achieved the guarantee of financial compensation for fishing professionals in the text on the common market organisation. Finally, a compromise was reached in relation to maximum sustainable yield, so that this rate could be applied at the latest in 2020, and not in 2015. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 Parliament has today approved a directive on energy efficiency that should enable us to aim for energy savings of 20% by 2020, which represents considerable progress. I particularly welcome the fact that the directive specifies a series of compulsory measures that contribute to the goal of energy efficiency. These include renovating public buildings, a strategy to encourage investment in renovating housing stock and commercial premises, cogeneration, energy saving certificates, and so on. The Commission has also agreed to publish a list of additional sectoral initiatives in order to ensure that the overall target of 20% energy savings by 2020 is really achieved. The course has been set; it is now up to Member States to implement this directive as quickly as possible. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

We must detect, assess and prevent the undesirable effects of medicines that are put on the market in the European Union, and we must do so at European level. Following the Mediator affair, the Commission implemented a ‘stress test’ which allowed us to identify weaknesses in current legislation. The present revisions are the result of this process. The improvements made today are numerous: most notably, the introduction of an automatic urgent procedure, the creation of a new trigger mechanism for the urgent procedure and the clarification of the transparency obligation of companies. The European regulation marks a significant step towards increased health security for Europeans, and we welcome that. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 I voted against this useless and dangerous text, whose only worth is that it has instigated pan-European debate and highlighted the democratic checks in place in Europe to tackle the relentless lobbying of some of the large multinationals. Today, not only have we voted against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), we have actually voted for European democracy. Showing little regard for the EU’s Treaties, citizens and democratic principles, the Commission has been negotiating the ACTA behind Parliament’s back since 2007. The exploitation of the Court of Justice of the European Union is just the latest blatant disregard for the democratic balance which we at the European Parliament uphold. The European Commissioner for Trade, Karel De Gucht, must now take responsibility, responsibility for his failings, his words and his method of working. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 Earlier today, we voted in favour of the general introduction of eCall, an in-vehicle emergency call system. This system, which is public and open, could contribute significantly to reducing the road death toll. That is why we have been advocating it since 2003. Unfortunately, for commercial reasons, car manufacturing lobbies want to impose private optional systems, which was supported by France’s former government which did not wish to invest in the scheme, and by several French MEPs from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Saving a life does indeed have a financial cost, but it is our duty as European law makers to show that, with a high-performance safety system, the EU can and must protect citizens. We are now waiting for the Commission to propose legislation quickly so that the system can become operational throughout the European Union by 2015. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, I would like to ask Mr Caspary how he can say that ACTA does not change anything in European legislation when we are right in the middle of reviewing the legislation on the protection of intellectual property and on the protection of personal data.

Mr President, at this time, many things have been said. Commissioner, I should personally like to express my most heartfelt thanks. Thanks to your stubbornness, your craftiness with regard to procedure, you have given us the opportunity to prove how important Parliament is as colegislator. Thank you, Commissioner, for having driven hundreds of thousands of citizens out into the streets to protest and 2.8 million people to sign petitions. They have discovered that democracy is played out here, that European elected representatives are the representatives of the people, their representatives. Thank you again for the millions of Internet users who have followed the debates and the votes in committee and who are still following us today. I would like to welcome them. It is a breath of fresh air in our institutions, which are all too often perceived as technocratic. Thank you, Commissioner, but in democracy, there is also another principle. It is the fundamental principle, the principle of responsibility. Tomorrow, we will take responsibility and I should like, tomorrow, to be able to thank you for also taking responsibility for your failure, the failure of your working method.

 Madam President, we will be holding a debate on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) tomorrow, but I wanted to raise an issue this evening which, although peripheral to the subject, I feel is extremely important. I am referring to what Commissioner De Gucht told the Committee on International Trade at its meeting on Wednesday 20 June. I quote: ‘If you decide on a ‘no’ vote before the European Court of Justice has handed down its ruling, let me tell you that the Commission will nonetheless continue with the proceedings currently before the Court. We have committed to this. A ‘no’ vote will not halt the proceedings before the Court of Justice’. Not only do his words disregard the treaties, in my view, but, above all, and this is what I want to condemn, they demonstrate an unacceptable disregard for the European Parliament, for democracy in general, and for the voters we represent.

 Today, Parliament has adopted a proposal for a regulation on food intended for infants and young children and on food for special medical purposes. We socialists are delighted to have achieved a strengthening of the provisions on food intended for vulnerable people, stricter rules on composition and labelling and a framework for food being placed on the market. Another important advancement we have achieved is the creation of a single list at EU level specifying the vitamins and minerals that may be added to foods. My only reservation is that the draft legislation excluded ‘growing milks’ used for children aged one to three. For the socialists, it is important that dairy products intended for young children are also covered by this legislation. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 Parliament has expressed its view on the implementation of the proposals contained in the Single Market Act. By way of a reminder, in April 2011, the Commission presented 50 actions to be carried out by 2014 to build a single market focused on the citizens. In line with the socialists’ amendments to the resolution, I condemn the tenor of the Commission’s recent legislative proposals and communications: a very liberal vision is revealed in the Commission’s proposals, which focus on facilitating business to the detriment of measures aimed at jobs and the citizens. I welcome the fact that Parliament has supported the priorities held by the socialists, such as the rejection of social dumping, the promotion of quality jobs, defence of the social protection model, the fight against tax evasion, but also an ambitious growth initiative based on the social market economy.

 At a time when the Council ought to be discussing a growth initiative, along with the other weighty issues, we need to bear in mind Europeans’ main expectation: keeping a job or finding a new one. The social situation is getting more difficult every day. We are facing the threat of a lost generation: 5.6 million young people are unemployed, that is one young European out of every five. We socialists welcome the Commission’s new attitude towards several issues, such as the minimum wage, which, until now, have been taboo. It is a major issue if we wish to solve the problems of poverty and internal imbalances within the European Union. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 The PIP breast implants scandal – which broke in March 2010 – has brought to light the serious malfunctions in European health safety. These tragedies are forcing us to carry out an in-depth review of the functioning of the European and national bodies responsible for health matters. Parliament’s reaction is in line with the gravity of the scandal: the resolution, which I voted for, calls for greater cooperation between Member States and greater control measures for medical devices placed on the market. This is an ambitious resolution in my view, as it also calls on the Commission to consider a system of pre-market authorisation for certain categories of medical devices. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this text, which reviews the scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP). The European Union has granted trade preferences to developing countries since 1971. These provisions are regularly adapted to take account of each country’s economic growth. Today’s vote is the first review of this system under the codecision procedure. In fact, we could barely have hoped for the compromise agreed with the Council, given the vastly differing positions of the Member States. For French Socialists, this text succeeds on two key issues: ensuring that the large emerging countries no longer benefit from preferential access to the EU market and facilitating exports from the poorest countries. This new trade regime will therefore enable us to provide better support to developing countries and it will be a step forward in our fight for fair trade as it will officially exclude the emerging countries almost entirely.

 I voted for the adoption of the Podimata report on the introduction of a financial transaction tax (FTT). Since the current crisis was brought on by stock market and financial speculation, I therefore consider it logical and just that this tax is finally introduced. The latest Eurobarometer survey shows that 66% of Europeans are in favour of such a tax. Furthermore, the FTT and the new resources to which it leads must contribute to financing growth in Europe. From this perspective, we must defend a tax base that is as broad as possible and fight against exemptions and loopholes which would favour speculators. In this regard, I regret the overcautiousness of the European right wing, which preferred to exclude pension funds, as if that financial instrument could not, like any other financial instrument, be at the service of speculation!

 I voted for the adoption of this report, which calls for the establishment of more balanced and fairer trade relations between the European Union and China, because I take the view that globalisation must not be based on unfair competition. The aim of this text is to urge China, the second-biggest trading partner of the European Union, to respect not only the principle of reciprocity in terms of trade, but also the principles of balance and compliance with social and environmental standards. Furthermore, it is necessary to rebalance access to China’s internal market to bring it into line with that of the EU, which is much more open and transparent. That is why the EU must establish a genuine strategy to promote ‘fair trade’ and to protect its industries and some of its sectors from social and environmental dumping, which is practised by some of its partners, most notably China.

 I voted for the amendments disclosing the risks of conflicts of interest within the EU agencies and proposing that we take measures to prevent this kind of practice in future. I also decided to abstain from the final votes in the cases of the European Food Safety Authority, the European Medicines Agency and the European Environment Agency. The French socialists are concerned not to impede the smooth running of the important programmes currently under way and therefore wished to stop at abstention. The aim is to shed light on practices that could go against the original purpose of these agencies. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the compromise text, negotiated with the Council, on the ‘roaming’ regulation, which will mean Europeans pay less to use their mobile phones abroad. As the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, we have called for the removal of these artificial borders within the internal market because they go against the very spirit of the European project and its founding fathers. That is why we urged the Commission to act quickly to effectively end roaming from 2016. As well as applying lower mobile roaming tariffs than those currently being charged from July, the text introduces, for the first time ever, structural solutions that will enable consumers to freely choose another operator for roaming services, separately from their domestic operator, from July 2014.

 I voted against this agreement. Although the fight against terrorism is a major challenge for the European Union as it is for its partners, we believe that it should not be pursued at the expense of the fundamental freedoms of citizens. However, this compromise, far from respecting the principle of proportionality, did not offer sufficient progress in terms of protecting privacy to persuade me to support it. All the more so as it appears to be difficult to gauge how effective the control and data storage measures are in the face of terrorist acts which are frequently not very sophisticated. Furthermore, while these data should strictly only be used as part of the fight against terrorism, in reality the purposes for which they can be used are very broad and very ill-defined. The retention period, the need for anonymisation and deletion, as well as the right of access, correction and deletion for the citizens concerned, are also important reasons for my rejection of this agreement. As Ms Guillaume pointed out, this is an unfortunate situation because this agreement should, on the contrary, have provided the opportunity to ensure that high data protection standards prevail, as behoves the European Union.

 I voted for this motion for a resolution. Water is a ‘shared resource’ and access to water should constitute a fundamental and universal right. All local authorities must be able to use the management method of their choice. On this subject, many people are strongly criticising the European Union, its institutions and in particular the Commission for being responsible for privatisations, but we must remember that, at present, there is no compulsory European ‘internal market’ directive, as is the case for other public service networks. We will ensure that the European Union does not commit to liberalisation policies and, on the contrary, guarantees free democratic choice for all public authorities in terms of their organisation and management methods.

Madam President, Commissioner, I am joining my colleagues to call for the issue of collective management societies to be dealt with quickly. I agree with the proposals you have just made regarding the harmonisation of horizontal rules on transparency and regarding the rules on online music. However, I must insist on the aim of fair remuneration for artists. Since the start of the mandate, for several years even, the issue of remuneration for artists has been mentioned exclusively in the context of infringements to intellectual property rights, making Internet users the scapegoats for artists’ lack of earnings. Yet, we are forgetting that, for each CD, for example, authors and performers only receive, on average, 6% of the sales price and that, for websites that sell music online, they receive hardly anything, around 1% per sale. Fair remuneration for artists must therefore be at the heart of our revision of collective management for the digital era. Of course, we need more transparency. In France, the Standing Monitoring Committee for management societies and distribution of rights published a damning report last year on the remuneration of the managers of these societies, for example. This committee also denounced a wave of invoices and deductions for costs. Artists must be at the heart of our concerns and many voices from all of the political camps together are denouncing a system which, in the end, places more importance on intermediaries than artists — that is what Neelie Kroes said — or even an opaque, confiscatory system as the French Minister of Culture has branded it. Commissioner, I therefore think that, if we revise these collective management rights, our objective and our end goal must be the optimal perception of intellectual property rights. These are conditions which are not merely incidental in the fight against infringements to intellectual property rights but which represent an essential prerequisite to the respect of these rights by users.

 I abstained. As my colleague, Estelle Grelier, so rightly said, this 2012 budget is, in fact, a Council budget, with just a ‘bit of soul’ added by the European Parliament. We are not fooled by the Council’s ploy: the Member States’ main preoccupation is to impose austerity, but they will not openly admit to the impact that this choice will have on EU policies on the ground. In order to cope with the recession that European citizens are enduring, while States are having trouble funding themselves and austerity policies abound, we need an EU budget that will meet this challenge at the very least, and allow us to implement policies for regeneration. Employment and growth in Europe are at stake. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 Today the European Parliament adopted the ‘economic governance’ package, after lengthy negotiations. For us, French and European socialists, it represents an austerity pact that prevents the Member States from kick-starting the economy and protecting themselves from the markets. In the end, only the proposals made by our colleague Elisa Ferreira will enable us to deliver specific solutions to the macroeconomic imbalances that undermine the sustainability and social bases of the euro area. We refuse to accept that Greece should be made solely responsible for the worsening of the economic divergences within the euro area. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 The European Parliament today adopted the Matias report which aims to establish a new strategy for research and innovation. As someone committed to the idea of progress, I believe that investment in research and innovation is fundamental to improving each of our lives. While I am delighted that there are several European programmes in this area, I, like my socialist colleagues, am convinced that numerous aspects could be improved upon: excessive bureaucracy, barriers to risk-taking by researchers, complexity, etc. All of this makes participating in these programmes difficult, particularly for SMEs.

 I voted in favour of this report. Today, Parliament reaffirmed its wish to see social, environmental and human rights standards made compulsory and legally binding in all trade agreements concluded by the EU. Faced with pleas from our fellow citizens for more regulation and new forms of solidarity, the EU must redefine a new doctrine for a different kind of trade policy.

 The introduction of this common platform of rights for all consumers within the Union represents a real step forward for the citizens of other countries where consumer information requirements are not as high and where the period for withdrawal is less well protected. However, it has given mixed results, as the aim of the Commission and the European right has been above all to facilitate cross-border trade, and not to harmonise upwards consumer protection. It is therefore a small step for the French consumer but a big step for the European consumer. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 We, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialist and Democrats in the European Parliament, introduced radical changes to the draft produced by the German conservative rapporteur of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), regarded by many as woefully inadequate, and we succeeded in obtaining a majority in the European Parliament on the objective of a fairer allocation of agricultural payments. The abolition of historical reference values, aid to farmers with small farms, a rebalancing in favour of the livestock sector and, above all, the adoption of the principle of the degressivity of direct payments, taking employment and the environment into account, represent crucial progress in this regard. I welcome the work carried out, which will also have made it possible to put in place tools committing agriculture to move towards more sustainable development, while taking into account the objectives of food security, the environment, territories and jobs. The greening of payments of the first pillar will also make it possible to encourage farmers to adopt good farming practices and to be more economically and ecologically efficient.

 I voted in favour of the report. Some Member States, including France, Germany and the Netherlands, want to change the rules of the game. However it is not reasonable to add other criteria such as an assessment of policies on combating corruption and crime.

 I voted in favour of this report. The great virtue of this report is to seek to mobilise all the EU’s budgetary resources in a coherent fashion and as a means to achieve the Europe 2020 strategy, and to take a stand that is diametrically opposed to the narrow approach of most Member States. While these Members bring Europe down to the common denominator of their contributions, which they would like to see fall, and of its financial returns, which they would like to see increase, this report argues for strong, integrated community policies, both in terms of long-standing policies and in terms of the new competences entrusted under the Treaty of Lisbon.

 Mr President, Commissioner, we can see that the application of the European Arrest Warrant raises the issue of detention which is very unevenly applied from one Member State to another. Some States show demonstrable laxity when it comes to respecting fundamental rights in a prison environment. Furthermore, amongst the 600 000 prisoners in the European Union, increasing numbers are detained in a Member State other than their own, due, precisely, to the European Arrest Warrant. Consequently, they do not enjoy the fundamental rights guaranteed by their state of origin. In circumstances such as these, there is no point in hurling abuse at each other; action must be taken. That is why, last January, my colleague, Mr Lambrinidis and I submitted a written statement calling for the harmonisation of detention standards throughout the European Union, and the introduction of independent national inspection mechanisms. I hope, Commissioner, that in the Green Papers that you will propose, you will bear this issue in mind, and that there will soon be a common platform of minimum rights which applies to all Member States.

I voted in favour of this report, not with the aim of putting up protectionist barriers, but because we can no longer have a situation in which the European Union is the only one respecting the rules of the game. We can no longer ignore social and economic dumping in emerging countries, China in particular, which are winning contracts with rock-bottom prices in the countries of the Union, without regard for social rights and legislation on State aid, whereas the markets of these countries remain inaccessible to European companies. We can no longer be naïve: the survival of our businesses and our jobs depends on this. Finally, I am pleased that the amendments submitted by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament concerning respect, in the context of public contracts, for the labour, social and environmental standards in force in the Member States, have largely been adopted. That demonstrates real awareness and represents a positive and necessary change. It is now for the Commission to assess this call fully. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

I voted in favour of this report to enable the transformation of a report which is all too often about exploitation and the law, in an area which represents between 5 and 9% of all jobs within the European Union. All those who work with our elderly people must be able to enjoy freedom of association and rest time, and must not be subject to harassment and arbitrary practices. That is why we wanted to send a strong message of support to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the trades unions prior to the negotiations on the adoption of these new instruments, which will commence in June at the 100th International Labour conference. We regret, however, that the right is happy to express concerns about illegal domestic workers while refusing to recognise that all too often, such situations involve workers with no papers, who are the main victims of precarity and abusive practices.

 I voted in favour of this report, which will enable the exponential demand for access to high frequency-consuming mobile Internet to be met in the short term, in particular, through the allocation of the entire 800 MHz band, freed up by the changeover to digital television in our various countries, to electronic communications services. In the medium to long term, our aim must be to improve the use of spectrum across the board, by recognising its social, cultural and economic value. At the same time, we are promoting innovative technologies (femtocells, cognitive technologies) in order to respond qualitatively to the demand for use of frequencies. This will contribute to the objectives that the Union has set itself, including that of bridging the digital divide, so as to ensure that all Europeans have broadband access by 2015.

 I voted in favour of this report as it is important to clarify matters at a time when the role of lobbies is still giving rise to much debate and, at times, conjecture among European citizens. We regret, however, that the registration of organisations has not been made compulsory, especially as it is a de facto
 obligation to register in order to receive a card to enter our premises. On the other hand, we have fought to ensure that the offices representing local, regional and municipal authorities in the European institutions are not affected by this measure, contrary to what was planned in the initial text. We consider these structures to be the direct product of democratically elected bodies. They represent the general interest, and should therefore be distinguished from lobbyists, who defend individual interests. Nevertheless, this register is an important step forward because, in many areas, the lack of transparency surrounding the role of lobbies can present a real democratic problem.

 I voted against this report. We want a free trade agreement between the EU and India that helps to promote sustainable development, and that is accompanied by clear clauses concerning respect for ILO standards, environmental rules and corporate social responsibility obligations. The right’s rejection of these requests is particularly regrettable. We also deplore the fact that the right-wing in Parliament rejected the amendment designed to ensure equal treatment of European and Indian workers. This is not only harmful to Indian workers; it is also very dangerous for European workers. We must not accept the liberalisation of services and social dumping aimed at bringing down European wages. Moreover, the European Union must not forget its founding principles. The Treaty of Lisbon stipulates that trade policy must contribute to sustainable development, eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

However, the outcome of the vote – the incoherent vote – forced me to vote against the amended resolution.

 The European Union’s trade policy should be consistent with the general objectives set out in the Treaty on European Union and contribute to sustainable development, employment and social progress in Europe and in its partner countries, as well as to a form of globalisation in which human and social rights are respected. Ms Jaakonsaari’s report on a new enhanced partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and Kazakhstan points to the latter’s serious shortcomings with regard to democracy and human rights, in particular workers’ rights. It states that, in order to tackle these practices, which are incompatible with the objectives of the European Union, the trade component of the agreement must include a binding chapter on compliance with social, democratic and environmental standards. I call on the Commission to apply the recommendations set out in this report in the ongoing negotiations. In the event of serious breaches of human rights, the European Union should not be afraid to invoke all conditionality clauses included in the agreement and, if need be, to suspend it temporarily. This conditionality is a prerequisite for maintaining a fair external policy and even-handed trade policy. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 In the resolution on public procurement, the European Parliament has strengthened the Commission’s proposal towards a social Europe: the most significant step forward is that authorities should no longer opt for the lowest bid, but for the most economically advantageous tender – one which includes, for example, environmental aspects. Likewise, the issue of subcontractors is taken into account in order to prevent abuse in relation to working conditions and workers’ safety. Nevertheless, there is still progress to be made where European public procurement policy is concerned. In particular, the Commission must impose the principle of reciprocity on its trading partners: if the Union agrees to open up its public procurement markets to third-country operators, then European companies should also have access to markets and public works in these countries outside the EU. European companies and employment in Europe must be a priority when business opportunities are looked at. The Commission must ensure that its forthcoming Public Procurement Directive serves the dual purpose of providing more quality jobs and offering quality services to users. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Since its inception in 2001, the World Trade Organisation’s Doha trade negotiation round has had the task of redressing the balance of world trade rules in favour of developing countries. These negotiations have now stalled. Various factors have contributed to the stand-off, for which all parties bear some responsibility, but it is developing countries that will be hit hardest by the failure of the negotiations. Every effort must be made to conclude the negotiations, but also to take into account the concerns raised, not least by developing countries, and particularly the situation in sensitive industries and in agriculture, where food security for citizens must be the priority. Public services should still be governed by each country to reflect the public interest, rather than being liberalised as part of enforced horse-trading with no reference to social needs. Subject to these conditions, the conclusion of the Doha Round is both desirable and necessary. The proliferation of bilateral agreements – like those currently under negotiation – will prevent us from establishing clear and fair rules. Multilateralism is still the best framework for ensuring fair trade that will encourage sustainable development across all continents. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the comprehensive economic and trade agreement negotiated with Canada will strengthen our links with a large and long-standing EU partner country. We welcome this, but we must keep track of all its consequences, not just the benefits it will bring for certain economic sectors or certain major international investors. In particular, the agreement must respect the social and environmental models of both parties – of the EU Member States and of Canada – and their capacity to continue to legislate in what are sensitive areas for our societies. These are not mere details or points to be left for another day. As regards public services, the Commission’s chosen ‘negative list’ approach is dangerous. It is far too broad and ill-defined, and we would not like to see it set a precedent. Also, from a general point of view, the chapter on investment must respect both parties’ right to legislate in areas such as the environment, public health, employee and consumer rights, industrial policy and cultural diversity, among others. We call on the Commission to exclude sectors such as culture, education and public health from the scope of the agreements. In this respect, and as other Members have said, the intellectual property part should not call into question issues relating to generic medicine production. As for the environment, we are concerned and call for investment. As regards the impact of the agreement on oil sands drilling, the agreement must not have the effect of weakening European legislation on the application of the Fuel Quality Directive, nor must it limit the possibility for Canada to regulate drilling of its oil sands in the future under its environmental remit. We also call on the Commission – we are asking the question, anyway – to monitor the impact on the fisheries sector in areas such as St Pierre and Miquelon. These are areas of Europe that could be severely affected by the complete liberalisation of that sector. Lastly, I echo Mr Kazak in saying that the sustainable development chapter must include social and environmental commitments and, in particular, social and environmental responsibility on the part of large multinationals.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-India free trade agreement negotiations are ambitious, they concern many economic sectors, but they are also a cause for concern in Europe and in India, as I was able to see during last month’s meeting between the trade committee of the two chambers of the Indian Parliament and the European Parliament’s delegation for relations with India. India is booming; it is a strategic partner, as you have reminded us. Everyone understands the importance of developing trade between us. Yet we are not starting from scratch, since the Union is already India’s main trading partner, the main investor in India and the main destination for Indian investors, and India is also the main beneficiary of the system of generalised preferences. We will therefore have to be alert to any new impact that a new and more far-reaching trade agreement may have on fragile sectors of the Indian economy. I am thinking, for example, of agriculture – our Indian colleagues spoke to us about this – and of the consequences for sectors that are particularly exposed to competition from emerging countries in Europe, and I am thinking of the car industry. Such an agreement should serve the development of our societies and of employment and not give rise to uncontrolled liberalisation that would have disastrous effects. That is why my group wishes to emphasise a number of points in these negotiations, which should culminate in an agreement that helps achieve the objectives of sustainable development and poverty eradication, and which should also be accompanied by clear and verifiable commitments, on the basis of cooperation, of course, but then coupled with serious social and environmental commitments. I should like to emphasise a few points in particular. Firstly, regarding agriculture – which I mentioned earlier – we call on the Commission to ensure that none of the agreement’s provisions, either on the liberalisation of agricultural trade or on intellectual property rights, threaten small-scale farming in India. I am thinking of the provisions on seeds, for example. Secondly, regarding generic medicines, India is the biggest producer of generic medicines in the developing world. We call on the Commission to stop demanding data exclusivity, since all the NGOs say it is liable to harm the distribution of those medicines. Thirdly, in the area of services, we call, firstly, for public services to be left out of the sectors to be liberalised and, secondly, concerning mode IV, for the principle of equal treatment to be guaranteed – in other words, for all forms of social dumping to be rejected. Lastly – thank you, Mr President – we believe that the sustainable development chapter must include binding commitments in relation to respect for social and environmental standards, in particular, ILO social standards.

 The report by Mrs Guillaume is an important step towards the revision of EU rules on asylum and protection for applicants for 2012. In view of the terrible tragedies that have taken place, such as the recent sinking of a Libyan boat off Lampedusa, this revision is vital, particularly considering that an applicant’s chances of obtaining asylum may differ greatly according to the Member State. With this text, we are calling on the European Commission to include in the proposed revision the right to free legal advice from the start of the procedure; better consideration of vulnerable applicants, such as unaccompanied minors; and a framework for the time limit for appeals. My one regret, however, is that the European right adopted a tightening of accelerated procedures based on the notion that asylum seekers are primarily potential fraudsters, limiting their rights. However, the adoption of Mrs Guillaume’s report sends a clear signal to the Council and Commission that they need to work to guarantee all asylum seekers in Europe decent, fair conditions and procedures.

Too often, the European Union is distant from its citizens, its policies seem far removed, and the European project lacks meaning in the eyes of Europeans. If the Single Market is only to be a conduit for rampant liberalisation, deregulating public services, social systems and workers’ rights by submitting them to fierce competition, this is a cause for concern, even though it has and may have several positive specific consequences for consumers and in the everyday lives of our fellow citizens. With Mr Correia de Campos’s report, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have fought for better regulation when it comes to strengthening the Single Market, and for this strengthening to serve the general interest of Europeans and not just that of businesses. Such interests include consumers’ rights, the protection of workers’ rights against the tendency towards social dumping, with an explicit recognition of collective labour agreements in all the Member States of the Union, the call for a recognised framework for public services, and universal access to these services. The integration of the Single Market must now go hand in hand with the advances of a social Europe, which is needed more than ever at a time when the recession continues to affect Europeans.

 For over 10 years, the European socialists have been fighting in the European Parliament for a tax on financial transactions. This tax would have many benefits: not only would it discourage financial speculation; it would also fund aid to developing countries and their adaptation to climate change, while contributing to the European Union’s budget. The world is now in a different situation: the recession has made the need to stabilise the financial markets yet more acute, and the European Union needs new resources to overcome this recession – it must overcome it by means of a recovery, not by means of austerity. At the same time, the groundswell in favour of the tax is getting bigger: more and more governments are supporting the idea, and the European Parliament has already voted repeatedly in favour of introducing a tax on financial transactions. This new vote in favour of the tax is an important step: Parliament is saying that we must act immediately at European level, even if there is no global agreement. Parliament’s request is clear, and the vote was an overwhelming one: we must now turn our words into deeds and implement the tax on financial transactions. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Over the last few months, the Lithuanian Parliament has passed a series of laws forbidding or punishing any reference to homosexuality or bisexuality in public. A bill currently being debated in the Parliament aims to amend the Code of Administrative Offences to punish ‘the public promotion of homosexual relations’ with fines of up to EUR 2 900. This legislation is in complete breach of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and of the European Union Treaties which commit the EU and its Member States to upholding freedom of expression and fundamental freedoms and to providing European instruments to fight discrimination and human rights violations. In adopting this resolution, we are calling for this bill to be withdrawn, for respect for sexual orientation to be included in the list of principles protected under the country’s Law on Education, for minors to have the right to freely access information about sexual orientation and for clarification of the prohibition stipulated in the country’s Law on Advertising. This is not the first time that a Member State has impeded European citizens’ rights and freedoms regarding sexual orientation under the pretext of non-interference, thus, in effect, encouraging discrimination. This homophobic hysteria must stop. Harlem Désir,

Mr President, we are proposing a change to the beginning of paragraph 32 in agreement with the shadow rapporteurs.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to begin by thanking my colleagues in the Committee on International Trade and, in particular, the shadow rapporteurs from the various groups for their cooperation in the drafting of this third report on a related topic. Today, we are able, thanks to this cooperation, to present a set of innovative, concrete proposals to move corporate social responsibility forward within the framework of EU trade policy. After the international crisis and the economic and social damage it caused, and after the debates it prompted, the expectations voiced by the public and the political expectations for lessons to be learnt, our common conviction is that Europe’s trade policy must contribute more than ever to the objectives of regulating globalisation and, in particular, to its social and environmental objectives. This regulation concerns the States and their economies, but it is clear that the main economic players are undertakings and, in particular, multinational corporations: they are the main players in world trade. They are the ones that have benefited most from market liberalisation, not only in terms of gaining access to customers, but also in order to externalise part of their production and to diversify their supply arrangements, often by drawing on countries where production costs are low and, above all, where social and environmental rules are applied less rigorously. The liberalisation of trade has been accompanied by fierce competition among countries seeking to attract foreign investors and by stiffer competition between undertakings. All too often this has led to unacceptable abuses in relation to working conditions, and to human rights violations and environmental damage. From the Bhopal disaster at the subsidiary of a chemical multinational in India, which claimed thousands of victims and for which the parent company has still not been punished to this day, to the behaviour of oil and mining companies in Africa, in Burma, and in many other countries, which is destroying their environment and reducing their workers to the rank of slaves; and from child labour in Asian textile factories to the murder of trade unionists on agricultural holdings in Central America, the examples are legion. And they are all the more unacceptable given that they often concern undertakings from industrialised countries, their subsidiaries and their supply chain, including European undertakings. This gave rise, many years ago, to a debate and a campaign which, I might add, was supported on several occasions within this Parliament through the adoption of resolutions on corporate social and environmental responsibility. The progress made in corporate social responsibility (CSR) is not yet on a par with the debate on social standards in trade agreements, the subject of the report by Mrs Saïfi. This is understandable, because trade agreements concern legal rules that are binding among the States, whereas corporate social responsibility concerns voluntary commitments by undertakings. At the same time, however, it is paradoxical, because CSR and the social and environmental clauses pull in the same direction, namely, towards globalisation which is more respectful of human rights and the environment and which is conducive to sustainable development. We therefore propose to incorporate CSR into trade agreements and, specifically, to incorporate a corporate social responsibility clause into the chapters on sustainable development, especially of free trade agreements (FTA), with a number of clear and verifiable commitments by undertakings. First, there must be a reciprocal commitment between the European Union and its partners to encourage undertakings to enter into CSR commitments and to verify them: the establishment of contact points not only to foster the provision of information but also to receive complaints from trade unionists and civil society; a requirement for corporations to publish their balance sheets regularly, which will reinforce transparency; a reporting requirement; and a requirement for undertakings to show due diligence and to take preventive measures. Finally, we propose that, in the event of serious breaches of the principles underpinning CSR and also of the violation of social rights and social and environmental laws, there should be mechanisms ...

 Mr President, as you can see, I had two minutes left. You knew this, so, if you had a time issue earlier, you could have deducted the time from this part of my speech, which could have been shorter. I should especially like to thank my colleagues and the Commissioner for his reply. What has been striking in this debate is the very broad consensus extending beyond the differences between groups. This is, however, qualified by the need to genuinely take greater account of the social and environmental dimensions in trade policy, in the agreements we negotiate. When you cut me off for your very interesting speech, which I am sure our fellow citizens throughout the Union will have found fascinating, I simply wanted to raise a point that the Commissioner himself raised, which is that corporate social responsibility cannot – he is absolutely right – replace compliance with the law and the responsibilities of the Member States. Furthermore, Mr De Gucht is also right when he says that, at this very moment, within the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and also within the World Trade Organisation (WTO), as a result of Professor Ruggie’s report, which Mr Howitt mentioned, new steps have been proposed with regard to the responsibility of multinational companies, not only in relation to mining but also in many other areas of responsibility – especially as regards their foreign subsidiaries – within their spheres of influence or throughout their supply chains. Judicial cooperation will also ensure that a parent company cannot evade its responsibilities in relation to the action of one of its subsidiaries or of a subcontractor, when it has infringed environmental or social rules. All of this is absolutely critical. I simply believe, though I admit it will be difficult, that we must establish a link with trade agreements. There are already a small number of references to corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the agreement with Korea and in the agreements with Latin American countries. I believe that, through the dialogue we have begun today with the Commission, we must continue to ensure that our CSR objectives and our sustainable development objectives are consistent with each other in international trade agreements.

Following Parliament’s vote, the Union is, at long last, going to regulate the activities of the most speculative investment funds. A long time has passed since Poul Rasmussen’s own-initiative report which, back in 2008, proposed that strict limits should be imposed on these ‘financial black holes’. It has taken the financial crisis to make the Member States and the majority of Parliament agree to adopt binding legislation on alternative funds. For the first time, these funds, whether or not they are based in Europe, will be subject to controls, restrictions on their activities and greater transparency; carving up businesses will no longer be possible, and the European Securities and Markets Authority’s supervisory powers will be extended. Much remains to be done to supervise finance effectively in Europe; ESMA, not the national authorities, should be the only authority with responsibility for this matter, and businesses should be protected even more from speculation. Had it not been for the reservations of the conservatives, the Union could have adopted more rigorous and more effective legislation. This is merely a first step. The text we have adopted will be revised in four years’ time. This will be an opportunity to go further, on the basis of an assessment, in order to protect the economy and jobs from the damage caused by speculation. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

In order to ensure the continued security of international transport, especially in the face of the risk posed by terrorism, it is vital for countries to be able to exchange information on passengers – PNR data, collected by airlines. However, it is just as vital to ensure that these provisions do not jeopardise citizens’ fundamental freedoms or result in some people being discriminated against because of their origin or religion. That is why the protection of personal data must be guaranteed better. The European Parliament has one clear demand to make before the Commission starts negotiating the methods of exchanging PNR data with the United States, Canada and Australia: the protection of personal data is too sensitive a subject for these negotiations to be conducted exclusively among Member States, behind closed doors. They must be conducted transparently, at EU level. The data transferred must be used only within a strictly defined context and must not be transferred to a third country. Many types of information will have to be excluded from the data that can be collected, in particular, that information in connection with ethnic origin and religious beliefs. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Parliament has just voted at first reading for extending maternity leave to a minimum of 20 weeks all over Europe, paid at full salary, except for high earners, and the possibility for fathers to take at least two weeks’ leave following the birth of a child. This is a victory for the proponents of a social Europe and a step towards more equality between men and women in Europe. A section of the right used the future cost of these measures as an excuse to reject this progress. Yet helping parents to reconcile family and work life will make it easier for parents to go back to work, will boost European birth rates and will safeguard the health of mothers and babies. The left of Parliament, with Portuguese Socialist rapporteur Mrs Estrela, held strong, the European right was divided and the move towards progress won the day. The battle must now be won at the Council, where several governments are threatening to block this directive. Members of national parliaments should take this up and intervene with their government so that governments do not undo what the European Parliament is proposing for a Europe that protects its citizens’ rights.

 The crisis has revealed the shortcomings of Economic and Monetary Union: it nearly brought down the euro and has resulted in the loss of millions of jobs throughout the continent. With Pervenche Berès’s report, the European Parliament has just adopted a coherent strategy proposal to lift Europe out of the recession and to address the latter’s financial, economic and social repercussions. This proposal includes the introduction of real financial supervision, which we have started to implement, but which will have to be considerably strengthened; the taxing of financial transactions in order to regulate the markets and finance public assets, and to reduce public deficits; the coordination of Member States’ economic policies and budgets for the benefit of sustainable growth; the appointment of a Mr or Mrs Euro to be in charge of the euro area and to unify its representation at the G20 and IMF; and the creation of the European Energy Community. It is now time for Europe to get going again. This is what the public expects. In a constantly changing world, inertia is tantamount to decline.

 The reinforcement of health care systems in sub-Saharan Africa is a crucial aspect of development policies. Compensating for the shortcomings in care systems will also have an impact on public health worldwide, through improved training for medical professionals, appropriate prevention campaigns and reduced treatment costs. This will contribute to a fall in serious epidemics, such as HIV, tuberculosis and dysentery. It is not acceptable for private companies to hinder access to health care for the sake of profits, and it is even less acceptable for conservative religious movements to reject sexual and reproductive health policies and question the right to abortion, thereby putting the health of millions of women at risk. In order to improve the health care systems in sub-Saharan Africa and throughout the world, it is essential for the European Union to be more in step with the rest of the international community. In particular, it has a role to play in encouraging the emergence of non-profit-making, solidarity-based mutual health structures, enabling the promotion of access to quality health care. This is why I support the adoption of Mrs De Keyser’s report. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Yesterday saw the opening of the United Nations summit on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. Even if progress has been achieved, we are far from the objectives set for poverty reduction between now and 2015. In order to achieve them, the first imperative is job creation in the developing countries, as, according to a recent joint report by the IMF and the ILO, there are more than 210 million unemployed in the world in 2010, as the crisis has caused the loss of 30 million jobs since 2008. The ILO is calling for employment to no longer be considered as an outcome of other policies but as a primary objective and pillar of growth strategies. Sustainable development, support for jobs and support for decent work demand support for the diversification of the economy, compliance with ILO standards, a set of social protection rights for all, investment in public services and addressing basic needs such as access to water, to health and to food security. More employment will also be a prerequisite for the stability and strengthening of democracy. That is the thrust of the Theocharous report. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, for the first time, Parliament will be called on to give its assent to a readmission agreement. This is a very important responsibility which I believe Parliament must exercise seriously, since it involves the safety of the people concerned. Pakistan is a state which has neither signed nor ratified the Geneva Refugee Convention or the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons. This agreement could affect not only Pakistani nationals but also citizens of other countries fleeing war and disturbances, and here, I am thinking, in particular, of Afghans who could well find themselves, as a result of this agreement, being sent to a state that offers no guarantees whatsoever. Therefore, Parliament’s first – and, I think, most legitimate – request is that we be given an assessment of the previous readmission agreements, since this was, after all, what the Commission promised. Secondly, we call for Pakistan to sign these Geneva Conventions before any agreement is envisaged. Thirdly – and this is the very least we expect – we ask that Parliament be able to take part in the Joint Readmission Committee; in other words, that it also is able to monitor the terms on which any future agreement is implemented. As the situation stands at the moment, I do not think we should give our assent tomorrow. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 The motion for a resolution on the situation of the Roma people is a major snub for Mr Sarkozy and a scathing call to order from the European Parliament. The stigmatisation of the Roma by the President during a speech on insecurity, the statements by his Minister for Home Affairs against the Romanians and the blatant expulsion of several hundred of them in breach of the law are an insult not only to the values of the French Republic but also to the fundamental values of the Union. Throughout history the Roma have been systematically marginalised, discriminated against and used as scapegoats. Regardless of whether they are French, Romanian or Bulgarian, today they are European citizens. The indignity of the treatment they have received should not be tolerated in a community founded on the principles of law, freedom, equality and non-discrimination, which lie at the heart of the EU Treaty and its Charter of Fundamental Rights. The resolution is therefore a firm and unambiguous condemnation of the French Government’s actions and of the discriminatory rhetoric that accompanied them. It condemns expulsions in breach of the law. It demands that the governments of Europe and the Commission coordinate their actions to integrate the Roma, using the funds allocated by Parliament.

Today, more than 20% of young people in Europe are unemployed, and many others are in casual jobs without social protection. The increase in the number of training courses casualises active young people and is a vector for social dumping affecting other employees, in that it puts pressure on companies to lower salaries and replaces normal jobs. The Turunen report asks the Commission and the Member States to organise their activities so that young people’s access to high quality training courses and jobs becomes a priority, and in order to guarantee them a decent income. It is unacceptable that some Member States are planning a lower minimum wage for young people. In this report, Parliament also calls for the introduction of a ‘European guarantee for youth’, which would give each young person in the EU the right to be offered a job, an apprenticeship, a supplementary training course or a job combined with a training course if that young person has been unemployed for four months. It also calls for the development of a ‘European Quality Charter on Traineeships’, which would include norms on time limits, minimum allowances and course-related social security benefits.

Achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 is a fundamental commitment by the international community. However, it has not provided itself with the resources to fulfil that commitment. Two-thirds of the way through, it is clear that many least developed countries (LDCs) will be unable to achieve any of the goals of eradicating poverty, of providing access to education and health care, and that most developing countries will be far from achieving them too. Europe is the world’s leading donor but, with 0.4% of GNI, it cannot be content with falling so far short of the target of devoting 0.56% to official development assistance (ODA) in 2010, a target that it set itself. The fact is, the aid requirements are greater than ever, especially in the areas of food security, the fight against climate change, education, health – in particular for HIV sufferers – and maternal and reproductive health. With the Cashman report, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is calling for the European Council of 17 June to endorse the proposal for a 0.05% tax on international financial transactions, which would yield EUR 10 billion, and to set itself the target of achieving 0.63% of European GNI in 2012, with a view to increasing it to 0.7%.

Developing countries, in particular, the poorest ones already hard hit by the 2007 food crisis, are today suffering the full force of the economic and social consequences of the international financial crisis that began in the developed countries. The latter are now inclined to reduce their development aid to face up to their own difficulties. Developing countries are thus paying twice for the mess caused by unregulated global capitalism. I voted for the Guerrero Salom report, which reminds Europe of its responsibilities and demands respect for the commitments made in relation to official development assistance, in particular, the goal of contributing 0.7% of GDP to this by 2015. By adopting it, Parliament is also calling for the implementation of an international levy on financial transactions to fund development, access to Global Public Goods and the adaptation of poor countries to the challenges of climate change. It supports cancelling the debt of the least developed countries. All of these recommendations are essential as we approach the review of the Millennium Development Goals at the United Nations in September.

The 2020 strategy is supposed to replace the Lisbon Strategy. It is, above all, in danger of prolonging the shortcomings, of ending in the same lack of results and of causing the same disappointment. It is neither a true recovery strategy nor a new perspective for the economic, social, budgetary and fiscal policies of the Union. The myriad good intentions are matched only by the absence of new instruments with which to implement them. Europe needs a different ambition; the citizens expect more convincing responses. Since the start of the crisis, the unemployment rate has increased by seven million. The banks are speculating again, hedge funds have not been regulated, the citizens are being asked to tighten their belts, drastic cuts are being made in public services and social protection is being cut back. The Greek crisis serves to reveal our lack of solidarity. That is why Europe must debate a different view of its future, one that is based on true economic coordination, a recovery characterised by solidarity, a green growth strategy, an energy community, a cohesion budget, own resources, investment in education, research, fiscal and social harmonisation, the fight against tax havens and the taxation of international financial transactions.

In 2000, I tabled with the Globalisation Intergroup the first resolution calling for the Commission to examine the feasibility of a tax on speculative capital flows. The resolution was not adopted, since it was just short of the number of votes required. Ten years have passed, the G20, like several Member States, is no longer ruling out the idea of such a tax, and above all, the financial crisis has served to remind us of the damage that volatile financial markets can cause. That is why I welcome the adoption by a wide margin of the resolution on taxes on financial transactions. This is only a small step, but the message is clear. Parliament is calling on the Commission to finally take up the issue and to work on an implementation project. A tax such as this would have the twin advantage of helping to stabilise the markets and of generating huge revenues to help developing countries finance their adaptation to climate change and the fight against poverty. Objectors tell us that it will only be effective if it is global, but make a start we must, as some countries have done with the tax on flight tickets. A wait­and­see policy will get us nowhere.

The current generalised system of preferences (GSP) will soon be coming to an end. I voted in favour of the resolution, a specific aim of which is to involve Parliament fully in its revision by 2012. This trade regime enables 176 developing countries and regions to benefit from preferential access to the European market in exchange for their ratification of ILO conventions on social rights and of UN conventions on human rights. Its implementation is unsatisfactory, however. That is why we demand, before the revision, a report on the current state of ratification, implementation of the conventions, an impact assessment of the effects of the GSP during the period 2006­2009, the inclusion of a condition stipulating that 27 fundamental UN conventions must be implemented, and more transparent investigation processes – involving, in particular, regular consultation of Parliament. It is regrettable that, during this vote, an amendment calling for an investigation procedure to be carried out in Colombia concerning the numerous killings of trade unionists and the mass graves containing the bodies of hundreds of people killed in the region of La Macarena was not passed because of opposition from the right.

 Mr President, Commissioner, this agreement with Korea will be the first to truly implement the Global Europe strategy as an important agreement, and it ought therefore to be particularly exemplary because it will set a precedent. However, we note that, firstly, there is a problem concerning the information given to Parliament, particularly with regard to the safeguard clauses, then a problem concerning the method used, since we have already been told that it might be possible to implement temporary provisions or temporarily to implement the agreement without even waiting for Parliament’s assent, and finally, a problem concerning the clarity and transparency of the trade framework – this was raised by Mr Rinaldi – since, through the duty drawback, we could in fact have an agreement indirectly concluded with China. I believe we must be particularly clear about these free trade agreements. In addition, there is a consistency problem with regard to the aim of developing social and environmental standards. When it comes to compliance with social standards, we are, for example, a very long way from what the United States has negotiated in its agreement with Korea.

Mr President, Commissioner, you have stated your hope that Tunisia will make progress in the areas of democratic reform and freedom of expression. You are right to do so, since this is quite simply in line with the association agreement and with the commitments that Tunisia has made to the European Union. That is why I am very surprised by the comments made by both Mr Baudis and Mr Michel, which seem to be encouraging you to ignore this aspect of our relationship and our cooperation with Tunisia, and to ultimately abandon Article 2 of the association agreement. Moreover, there is a long way to go before these commitments are honoured, judging from the fate – as already mentioned by my colleague, Mrs Guillaume – of the independent journalist Taoufik Ben Brik, who has been in prison since last October, following a trial in which his lawyers and the procedure were in complete violation of the law. In addition to the unacceptable denial of his freedom, his health is deteriorating and his visiting rights have been restricted. I therefore ask you, Commissioner: does the Commission intend to intervene within the framework of the Association Council to demand Mr Ben Brik’s immediate release and to ensure that his situation and his state of health may be taken into account, at the very least on humanitarian grounds?

 Thank you, Minister, for your reply. I congratulate you on your initiative to hold this conference in Palma de Mallorca in March, as it will follow on from the conference held in Stockholm. The problem is that we have to contend with multinational companies; as you said, Europe has to take the lead in corporate social responsibility, but it also has to take the lead as regards the conduct of European companies located outside Europe. The problem is that these subsidiaries are separate legal entities. Are you prepared to envisage a legal instrument by which parent companies would be obliged to assume responsibility for the conduct of their subsidiaries located in other parts of the world when they fail to meet their obligations in relation to the environment or to respect for human or workers’ rights? Because, if this obligation is not imposed, European companies will slip through the net of this corporate social responsibility that Europe wishes to promote due to the conduct of their subsidiaries located elsewhere in the world.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate Mrs Joly on her work, on the report and also on taking into account the contributions of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, and, although we have again tabled some amendments, we see our contribution in the resolution that she has presented. For our group, the partnership between the European Union and the ACP countries is part of an historic commitment, which must retain all its specific characteristics, which must not be watered down, even by the need to comply with certain rules, such as those of the WTO. We are most concerned that this partnership should preserve, in particular, the consistency of all European Union policies – trade policy, budgetary policy – with objectives in the area of development, but also in relation to the promotion of peace, security and democracy and human rights in ACP countries. It is not a question of imposing a model, but of working with these countries to ensure their development, which must be sustainable development. From this point of view, it is very important for this revision to enable us to take into account new elements of the last five years: the fight against climate change, technology transfers, renewable energy development aid, the fight against food crises, and therefore greater emphasis in our cooperation on agriculture, on food sovereignty, the fight against financial deregulation, good fiscal governance and the fight against tax havens. We see our contribution in all of that. I would like to stress two points. Trade: with the implementation of the Economic Partnership Agreements, certain provisions of the Cotonou Agreement will become obsolete, but we are concerned that this agreement should still mention that the trade clauses and the trade regimes from which the ACP countries benefit must not be less favourable than those from which they benefited previously. It seems to us that we should integrate the GSP, the interim EPAs and all these provisions in the revision of the Cotonou Agreement. Finally, on emigration – our colleagues in the group will emphasise this – we are concerned that it should actually be said that the migration agreements preserve the rights of migrants and that we cannot accept transit regimes to countries that do not guarantee respect for human rights.

Mr President, I just wanted to say that, if I understand our fellow Member Mr Papastamkos’s amendment correctly, it is about recalling the commitment made in Hong Kong by all the WTO members to abolish export subsidies. Therefore, contrary to a mistake made on our voting papers, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament does indeed endorse this amendment. Harlem Désir,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Doha talks were opened in 2001 to correct the imbalances, in fact the injustices, of the international trade system that was introduced following the Uruguay Round, when the WTO was created. It was thus acknowledged that the Uruguay Round had not kept all the promises it had made concerning developing countries, and that the countries of the South were at an unfair disadvantage where trade rules were concerned, particularly in the field of agriculture, because these trade rules allow the richest countries both to protect their market and to continue to fund their production, including that intended for export, bankrupting many farmers of the South in the process. Cotton has come to symbolise this situation. In opening the ‘development round’, the WTO members have therefore committed themselves to amending multilateral trade rules in order to ensure that trade really does benefit economic and social development in every country, on every continent. Thus we should always remember that this round of negotiations is not a round like any other, and that, even if, as in all negotiations, everyone is waiting for progress to be made on the issues that concern them – for industrialised countries, that means industrial products and services – it was agreed, from the outset, that this round was, first and foremost, about restoring the balance in favour of developing countries. Today, in the wake of the Seventh Ministerial Conference, as before it, negotiations have essentially stalled on the slopes of Capitol Hill in Washington, just as they sank, in the past, in the sands of Cancún, and, back then, this was largely due to the demands made by the European Union. Having demanded too much during the negotiations, industrialised countries have thus jeopardised the final outcome of the round of negotiations and the credibility even of the WTO. Everyone is focusing solely on personal goals instead of on the overall goal, which is to create a multilateral trade framework that is based on fairer rules to encourage fairer trade, and which promotes sustainable development and the eradication of poverty. The first outcome of this stalemate is the increase in bilateral trade agreements, which are often even more unfavourable to the countries of the South. This is a step backwards. The European Union must therefore adopt a clear position. The priority is to conclude this round as a development round and not to try to outdo one another where industrial products and services are concerned. These negotiations must not be approached in a conventional and narrow-minded manner, where everyone is simply out for themselves. This leads to a deadlock and makes one lose sight of the main issue: the need to create a new way of regulating the international trade system that will form part of the new global governance that everyone has called for, particularly since the G20, in order to address the real challenges of today, which are fair development on all continents, the eradication of poverty, food security, respect for social rights and decent work, and the fight against climate change. During these negotiations, the European Union must show what it is doing to ensure that trade rules will help improve this situation in the future. It is on this basis that each of the following points of discussion must be considered: – on agriculture: honouring the July 2008 commitments; concluding the negotiations on procedures; guaranteeing, in particular, special and differential treatment, respect for special products, and safeguard mechanisms; developing agricultural support in accordance with sustainable agriculture and food security; – on NAMA products: asking developing countries for tariff reductions – I am finishing here – that are in line with their level of development; and – on services: protecting the right of every country to continue to regulate its public services.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 28 September, the people of Guinea took to the streets to appeal for the commitments that had been made to be honoured, and for free and democratic elections to be held, as promised. They have suffered the worst possible repression by a regime that was already devoid of all legitimacy and which, that day, lost all dignity. Men were repressed, women were disembowelled with bayonets, and raped, and the political opponents and trade unionists were tortured and maimed. The European Union must today support the African Union, ECOWAS and the United Nations in refusing to allow this crime to go unpunished and, above all, in showing solidarity towards the Guinean population. This country, which has an abundance of assets, will never be able to use them for its development as long as corrupt dictatorships can seize them for the benefit of a clan. That is why I welcome the firm approach announced by the European Commission, one which our Parliament is able to demonstrate today. We cannot weigh strict economic interests against the commitments that were made by the European Union’s partners, particularly those who signed the Cotonou Agreement, concerning respect for human rights and respect for democratic principles. Today we have a commitment to the people of Guinea: to support them in their fight for freedom and democracy. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation between Europe and the United States is crucial in resolving most of the major crises in the world, and the new US administration certainly provides an opportunity. It has already taken some initiatives that have marked a break with the past: in Iraq, on Guantánamo, on the anti-missile shield. It would be naïve, however, to think that that will be enough to make US and European points of view identical in all situations, and that transatlantic relations will now be very simple. Whether on preparations for Copenhagen or aid to developing countries, on Doha and protectionism, on financial regulation and combating tax havens, on the relaunch of the peace process in the Middle East or a firm policy on the nuclear issue in Iran, the US is extremely unwilling to take action. This goes beyond the issue of whether or not the administration has good intentions, and often relates to the influence of lobby groups on Congress, or simply the defence of its interests by a great power which is being shaken by the new world order. All these spheres will only make progress if Europe plays its proper political role as a separate global player, in a partnership of equals – to use the Commissioner's expression – and fully assumes its responsibilities. From this viewpoint, I must say that there is a certain confusion in the European attitude and sometimes even a certain naivety, and that this also extends to Parliament. The approach being taken to the idea of a large transatlantic market, which was Sir Leon Brittan’s hare-brained scheme back when he was Commissioner, poses certain risks. This affair of barriers to trade is being tackled as if the problems were only of a technical nature. Naturally, economic and commercial trade between the United States and Europe is important for jobs and for businesses. It ought to be developed. First of all, however, trade is not really in danger. Secondly, when there is a conflict, either it relates to defending our economic interests – for example, as in Airbus – or it poses a risk to our health or environmental rules – in the case of beef containing hormones, for instance, or chlorinated chicken – and we should therefore not prioritise the improvement of economic relations over our own internal model, our social model, our environmental model, or development model, as if economic relations were an end in themselves. We must be able to combine the two, and we should not surrender our political autonomy in search of a partnership that is, in itself, a commendable objective. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two Member States – France and the United Kingdom – have announced their intention to send to Afghanistan refugees who came to Europe in an attempt to save their own lives. I do not believe that we can continue to stand back in the face of this very serious threat to their lives. The British newspaper, The Guardian
, reported in October that some Afghan refugees expelled from Australia had been killed upon their arrival in their country. I believe that all of this goes completely against all of our international commitments. The European Commission itself said in an action plan dated June 2008 that legitimate measures to reduce illegal immigration should not result in refugees being denied access to protection within the European Union, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has warned the European Union against making any attempt to undermine the Geneva Convention and the other additional forms of protection that are designed to ensure that Afghan refugees are not deported to Afghanistan. A large number of MEPs, from four different groups, have signed an appeal along these lines. I call on you, Mr President, to talk to the European Commission, the United Kingdom and France, and our House, our Chamber, must take up this issue in order to prevent this crime against the right of asylum from being committed.

 Madam President, the excellent report by Mr Lange has three positive features. Firstly, it proposes an integrated industrial strategy for the European Union; that is to say, a strategy at once continental and cooperative, which differs in all respects from the narrowly national and non-cooperative policies in operation in Europe for the last 15 years. Secondly, this industrial strategy is financed, which is in marked contrast to the 2000 Lisbon strategy. If it were not financed, it would remain empty words. The main source of this funding is EU project bonds, Eurobonds and euro projects. In voting this morning, we faced up to that. Thirdly, this strategy protects our industries. This report is for opening up Europe; it is against giving it away. It is for exchanges founded on reciprocity and balance. Several articles focus on these issues. This is absolutely crucial because, in this area, we appear naive and weak. Henri Weber  (S&amp;D

Madam President, for such an important debate, I would have liked Baroness Ashton to have been present or at least one Member of the Council. Good for China! It has decided to lead the way in green technology; 38% of its massive recovery plan has been invested into these new industries. It is already the number one producer and biggest exporter of solar panels and wind turbines in the world. We would be only too delighted with this new direction, which can help reduce pollution levels in China and world-wide, were production to be carried out in accordance with WTO rules. However, that is not the case. Chinese exporting companies receive massive aid from state banks and local authorities. Although some green technology markets are open to foreign companies and foreign investment, many remain restricted in terms of quotas and some are even closed. Our European industries are under threat in the light of such unfair competition. Commissioner, China has signed WTO agreements. The European Union must ensure that it adheres strictly to the rules.

Mr President, the European Union has many tools to make it a global leader in the manufacture of clean cars and, in particular, of electric cars. The Commission must ensure that this project is a major European objective by encouraging the large car companies on our continent to cooperate with one another, with such cooperation extending from research and development to marketing. It must encourage the widespread installation of accessible and interoperable charging points in Europe, starting with urban areas. It must draft and enforce common rules and standards – if possible, at international level, but certainly at European level – and it must do so without delay. Lastly, it must encourage the Member States to gradually replace their fleet of combustion vehicles with electric cars. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the ban on removing the fins of sharks on board vessels. This practice has been prohibited in the EU since 2003, but some shipowners benefiting from exemptions in Spain and Portugal are suspected of ‘finning’, which involves cutting off a shark’s fin and throwing its flesh back into the water. The report therefore plans to force all fishermen to wait until their vessels have landed before cutting off sharks’ fins. This debate is a perfect illustration of the need to establish a real European fisheries control policy. The practice of ‘finning’ is unacceptable, but there is no proof that it takes place in Europe. However, in view of the doubt, it was necessary to remove any possibility of the continuation of such practices. Since controls have failed, the European Parliament has been forced to eliminate all exemptions, which will not be without consequences for professionals. The challenge now is to ensure that the issue of European fisheries control is dealt with more effectively. In particular, uniformity of controls must be promoted and the resources allocated to this vital tool for our fisheries policy must be increased. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 As shadow rapporteur for this report, I was involved in defining artisanal fishing. This term features repeatedly in texts on the common fisheries policy reform, without appearing to fit the definition established by the Commission. Indeed, the latter admits to having opted for a simplistic definition – currently, all vessels measuring 12 metres or less. However, this fails completely to take account of the diverse nature of European fishing. Given that small operators have more difficulty in gaining access to European funding, a new definition may be required to ensure fairer distribution of this funding. To that end, classification as a micro-, small or medium-sized enterprise and the skipper-on-board requirement appear to be more appropriate criteria. Even if Parliament has not come up with a final definition of artisanal fishing, this report should be welcomed for anticipating the discussions on the financing of fisheries and for wisely acknowledging that there is not one single criterion but a whole range of criteria for defining artisanal fishing.

 I voted in favour of the Lövin report, an own-initiative response to the Commission communication on the external dimension of the common fisheries policy. In the context of a CFP reform in which European fishing rules are becoming ever stricter, this report seeks to promote a sustainable fisheries policy beyond the EU’s borders, so as to protect European fisheries from unfair competition, by proposing that fishery products imported into the European Union should be subject to standards aligned with our own as regards environmental and social sustainability. Fish have no concept of borders. The European Union’s efforts to exploit fish stocks sustainably will be in vain, therefore, if we do not make sure to apply these requirements worldwide. By tackling the issue of the common fisheries policy reform in a global context, this report serves, in its own way, to foreshadow part of the substance of the future CFP. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, the debates on fisheries at this part-session each herald, in their own way, part of the structure of the future common fisheries policy. As architects of this policy, we must always bear in mind that each pillar of sustainable development affects the balance and solidity of that structure. In other words, the fisheries policy must at the same time be economically viable, safeguard jobs and preserve resources. These five reports put the main objectives of the future CAP to the test: maximum sustainable yield, reducing rejects and allocating fishing rights. These objectives cannot be mere slogans, however. Consequently, the technical measures in the Gallagher report, despite being only transitional, highlight the difficulties involved in moving to practical cases, fishery by fishery, stock by stock. The Ferreira report on artisanal fishing rightly recognises that there is not one criterion, but a range of criteria, for defining artisanal fishing. The Gróbarczyk report highlights the lack of data. The Lövin report on the external dimension points out that we are evolving in a global context and looks at the conditions for the exploitation of resources outside European waters as well as the import conditions to ensure fair trade. We cannot allow the restrictions imposed on our fishermen to continue without balancing them with import restrictions to prevent unfair competition. Finally, the Patrão Neves report on sharks emphasises, in particular, the urgent need for stronger EU controls. The success of an ambition cannot just be declared: it requires patient, meticulous work between goals and resources. That is what we are trying to do. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report on protecting children in the digital world. The digital world is a great tool for communication, information and education. However, children today are accessing this world at an increasingly young age. Parents are not always able to protect them in this enlightening but complex universe, where there are dangers such as commercial targeting, sexual abuse, bullying on social networks, etc. I supported this report because it will allow greater coordination of actions at European level. Education about digital media, tackling illegal content and content harmful to minors, protection of privacy and the right of reply will help to protect children. This report has successfully brought together two important principles: protecting children and defending freedoms. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 The Erasmus programme has proved its worth by enabling millions of young people to go and study in another country, improve their qualifications, learn a foreign language and discover another culture. The scheme contributes to European integration but also to the personal integration of young Europeans. Anything that came in its way would be a step backwards at a time when citizens are having their doubts about the EU and our young people are having doubts about the future. The programme is now a victim of the short-term vision of some Member States that, in the name of defending liberal dogma, are endangering one of the EU’s tools for investing in the future, that of training and that of youth. Discussions on the 2012 and 2013 budgets are well on the way to overcoming this deadlock, but this should not be disconnected from the negotiations under way on the financial framework for 2014-2020. The proposal of a freeze on the EU’s budget is unacceptable when we are promoting education and qualifications as the main assets in the fight against unemployment, particularly of young people. On the contrary, a substantial increase in the EU budget is necessary to get through the crisis and prepare for the future. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

I voted for the report on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources, a report voted on unanimously in plenary, which was a historic moment! The report itself presented no problems. The access regime to the current zone of 12 nautical miles, which is managed and controlled by the Member States, is one of the CFP measures introduced in 2002 that has been the most widely supported by stakeholders, and the effectiveness of which is undisputed. The report voted on in plenary only had the effect of extending the time limit of the regime until 31 December 2014, after which it was expected to be brought into line with the CFP reform currently under way by means of a new regulation. The vote was unanimous because certain questions raised by the committee were not addressed, such as the proposal to extend the derogation in coastal zones beyond the current limit. In order to avoid any further extension, the rapporteur also proposed that the regime should be extended indefinitely. These questions will of course be discussed in more detail when the future regulation is adopted, which is expected to cover a period of 10 years. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to support Peugeot employees. Almost EUR 12 million will be released for the 2 089 workers who were made redundant by Peugeot. These funds will be used to finance active reintegration measures additional to those required by virtue of French law and to help the workers to find new jobs. However, I regret that this support for Peugeot employees is one of the EGF’s last on the basis of the ‘crisis’ criterion and that access to the Fund will be restricted in the future. At a time when the recession and unemployment explosion are hitting European countries, the Council has unfortunately decided that this ‘crisis’ criterion may no longer be invoked to mobilise the EGF.

 I voted for the report on the minimum level of training for seafarers. The European Parliament had limited room for manoeuvre, since the Member States had already accepted the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW). These changes constitute progress on training and the harmonisation of the issue of certificates of competency. They also improve the prevention of fraudulent practices and the standards applied in respect of fitness to work, medical requirements and requirements concerning alcohol abuse. In a sector which operates without borders, it is in the interests of seafarers, as well as in the general interest, for the certificates issued by Member States and third countries to be recognised everywhere in Europe. However, to avoid a ‘race to the bottom’, it is necessary to ensure that a certain number of strict common criteria remain in place. We can be satisfied that this is the case. I also welcome the Commission’s initiative of obliging Member States to communicate the available information on certificates, an appropriate provision which will help establish an overall picture of the current state of affairs and a strategy for employment in the sector.

 I voted in favour of the report on measures taken for the purpose of the conservation of fish stocks in relation to countries allowing non-sustainable fishing. The content of this report is crucial, as it seeks to ensure fair competition between European fishermen and third countries. Faced with an ambitious European legislation to protect fish stocks, we must be given a guarantee that our fishing activity is not relocatable at lower environmental costs. This report mentions the option to restrict imports of fishery products originating from countries allowing non-sustainable fishing, to restrict the provision of port services to vessels flying the flag of those countries or to prevent Union fishing vessels from fishing the stock of common interest under the responsibility of the country allowing non-sustainable fishing. However, I note with regret that the report is entirely conditional, so I hope the European Commission will be quick to make a legally binding proposal on this matter. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted for the report on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products, although it would have been a better idea to put it to the vote after the adoption of the basic Regulation on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The progress achieved by the vote is patchy. On the negative side: this report provides for a market of landed by-catch, and yet this landing has not yet been agreed in the basic regulation. It is, however, necessary to have at our disposal a legal framework, without pre-empting any means which will be implemented to limit, or even eliminate, by-catches. I was, on the other hand, very much in favour of Parliament recognising the need to put European funding for the storage mechanism on a sustainable basis and agreeing to create an eco-label. Producer organisations have also been given greater power and recognition, and can, in particular, become transnational. Finally, the report supports the development of aquaculture, a development that I support providing that we bear in mind that this activity is complementary to fishing and must be set within a framework of strict environmental standards, without promoting the creation of a fish meal market.

 I voted in favour of the report on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources. This own-initiative report is satisfactory because it has allowed us to move the debate on the common fisheries policy (CFP) forward, particularly by highlighting the consensus in Parliament on the need to improve data collection, an essential prerequisite if we are to arrive at a sound definition of the CFP’s objectives at a time when the status of some fish stocks is still unknown. However, it is only one vote in the process. This report also points out the need to go in the direction of greater decentralisation, at a time, in particular, when the Commission has stated that there are too many ships in the European fleet compared with available fish stocks. Yet it does not study the realities of each coastline and the different fish stocks found there. The report also notes that one of the prime priorities of the CFP should be jobs, because without fish, there is no fishing, and without fishermen, neither is there any fishing. Finally, Parliament has noted that transferable fishing concessions should be an optional management measure, and recognised that the obligation to land by-catch should be adjusted to the realities of each fishery.

 I voted in favour of the overarching communication on the common fisheries policy (CFP). This non-binding report is acceptable insofar as its content anticipates and influences forthcoming debates on the basic CFP Regulation. It has enabled us to make some progress on the Commission’s proposals, which is important for future negotiations, and which, I hope, will allow for further improvements. In the face of the EU’s very controversial proposal to introduce transferable fishing concessions, a tool for liberalising the fishing industry, Parliament spoke in particular in favour of a voluntary system, allowing Member States to decide whether to implement it or not, which is an encouraging start. Parliament also noted that we should reach the maximum sustainable yield by 2020, and not exceed it, a notion thought to be too vague. The proposal to land all by-catches, which the industry has great difficulty in implementing because of technical constraints, has also been watered down, in favour of a gradual implementation on a case-by-case basis, depending on the characteristics and realities of the different fisheries. There should be further discussion about the technical feasibility of implementing such a measure. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report on the sulphur content of marine fuels. With this directive, the EU is making provision for a reduction in the sulphur content of ship emissions to 0.1% by 2015 in the Baltic Sea, the English Channel and the North Sea. It therefore transposes into EU law an obligation required by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), which was difficult to ignore. The 2015 deadline, however, seems very premature given the economic and technical constraints that it will impose, especially on passenger shipping. The fear is that some ships will have to be withdrawn from the fleets, as there will be no way of adapting them to the new requirements, leading to the loss of hundreds of jobs in an economic context where passenger transport companies are facing difficulties. Negotiations in Parliament have, however, allowed us to confirm that State aid would be authorised to support the operators in this transition. There is also a reminder that Member States can still approach the IMO for an extension to deadlines to allow their fleets to be fitted out within the deadlines. These different safeguard measures have led me to approve the transposition of the European Union’s international obligations in this directive. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report on Education, Training and Europe 2020. Education and training are crucial elements in achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and ensuring the future growth of Europe. The current economic difficulties must not be used as an excuse to reduce the resources set aside for education and training. In order to guarantee the investments for the future, the Socialists proposed excluding investments in education and training from the national deficit calculation of the fiscal compact. As the report points out, dropping out of school early has a higher cost than the crisis. There is thus no point in making short-term savings that would compromise future growth. For the same reasons, we encourage the Member States to devote at least 2% of their GDP to higher education in order to ensure a knowledge-based economy. However, additional efforts are required in the area of early childhood education and schooling, which is a crucial stage in the development of our future workers and citizens.

 We are preparing to vote on a number of texts that will define the future of European fishing. These texts affect hundreds of thousands of jobs, our food autonomy, the preservation of fish resources and the durability of an economic sector. Despite the fact that these major issues are evidently of general interest, the Commission has given its draft reform a very liberal slant. Parliament’s work has, of course, toned down these proposals. It is just a first step, however. Future work must go beyond declarations of intent. From now on, we have to build real tools to achieve an economic, social and environmental balance for this activity, in accordance with the EU’s 2020 strategy. It is just as essential to preserve jobs as it is to preserve resources. We urgently need to establish homogeneous controls throughout the Union. Similarly, we can no longer use different methods to collect scientific data. The renewal of the fleet is essential for the emergence of a future fishing sector that is more selective, safer, cleaner, and more efficient and thus more profitable. Otherwise, we will be left with one question: is the fisheries policy an exception to the 2020 strategy? Kader Arif,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we have just heard, the question of public procurement reform is a fundamental one for Europe, particularly at this time of crisis. European rules are generally focused on the criterion of price, which means that our businesses are helpless in the face of foreign operators that do not hesitate to practise social and economic dumping in order to win public procurement contracts in Europe. That is why it is essential to recognise additional criteria, including in the WTO agreement on government procurement. In the debate that I led in the Committee on International Trade, I stressed the need to reform that agreement and to extend it to new countries, particularly emerging ones. However, the creation of new instruments is also urgently required. In particular, we need an effective and binding tool for establishing a greater degree of reciprocity with countries that do not offer equivalent access to European operators. Since the Commissioner has brought it up, I should also like to receive more details about the legislative proposal that is being drafted. Lastly, we need to create an instrument for supervising buyouts of European businesses by foreign capital, in particular, by sovereign funds. This is a solution that has already been applied by the United States through an ad hoc
 committee and which ensures the protection of this strategic sector. Europe, which can be naive or weak when faced with its foreign competitors, would be well advised to take inspiration from it. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, aside from the work which Mr Caspary has done, I find that the new trade strategy proposed by the Commission does not address the challenges which Europe has to face in light of the financial, economic, social, environmental and food crises we are experiencing, nor does it address the expectations of our fellow citizens who are calling for stronger regulation and for a new sustainable growth and development model for the planet. Unfortunately, however, this does not or no longer comes as a surprise. Faced with these calls for new regulation and new solidarity, the Union must establish a new doctrine for an alternative trade policy. If Europe does not advocate a fairer form of trade that is founded on the values of justice and that generates quality employment in both Europe and the rest of the world, who will? Solely promoting services is not a policy. We need to preserve strong industrial and agricultural sectors through an employment-generating industrial policy and an updated CAP. The inclusion in all of our free trade agreements of social and environmental standards, and stringent human rights rules which guarantee decent working conditions, is fundamental. Europe must lead the way in balancing trade openness with room for public intervention and the legitimate protection of various economic sectors both in Europe and in its partner countries – a fair trade policy for fair trade should be the aim.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ever since the United Nations General Assembly agreed to create two states on the territory that formerly constituted the Palestine Mandate in 1947, we have never stopped waiting for that commitment to be realised. So how can we now accept the caution expressed in the speeches? In the light of this historic opportunity, how can we justify refusing to back President Abbas’s request fully? Let me remind you, Baroness Ashton, that sometimes caution can result in cowardice. I would therefore like to pay tribute to the courage and perseverance of one man, Mahmoud Abbas. He is the bearer of a legitimate hope, that of a people who have a right to a land. For those who object to the fact that this initiative could provoke an outbreak of violence, let me remind you that a few years ago, the suppression of a similar initiative fostered the Second Intifada. My message is simple, Baroness Ashton: at the time of the Arab Spring, it is your duty and ours to support the Palestinian request to the hilt. The European Union boasts of having brought down a wall and of recognising states. It will be able to stand even prouder if it recognises that the Palestinians are also entitled to statehood.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am even wearing a flower-patterned shirt to symbolise the Arab Spring. Who could have expected, a few months ago, this wind of change energised by the universal values of democracy and which is now blowing on the southern shores of the Mediterranean and more widely on the Arab world? No one. Certainly not most European leaders who have been urging us for years to enter into agreements of all kinds with dictatorial regimes for the sake of Europe’s interests. Today, I say to myself that it is never too late to show courage and dignity – the courage to say to our people that there is no Muslim horde about to sweep across Europe, but that there is a young population who, paying with their blood, want to see democracy irreversibly established, and want Europe to be a partner who helps them, so that the rule of law is no longer an illusion but becomes a reality. Tunisia and Egypt are currently in a situation of emergency. There is not enough time here for me to give an overview of the countries where there are uprisings. However, I do want to vigorously condemn with all my heart, here before you, the atrocities committed by the Gaddafi regime in Libya and the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. Naturally, this condemnation is directed at all countries where the word ‘repression’ is opposed to the word ‘freedom’. In moments like these, even if history is sometimes cruel, the international community – of which you are one of the dignitaries, Madam – should react so as to show support to and solidarity with the peoples who have taken up the struggle, but also to condemn in the strongest possible way, and in all instances, all these contemptible regimes and all the countries that do not comply with international law or with United Nations resolutions. In your communication of 25 May, you mentioned this support. I know that this is one of your priorities. However, I urge you, Baroness Ashton, even if this means devoting all your energy, to move from appeasing words to constructive solutions. I would not wish to see, as the only response to this Arab Spring which is changing the face of the world, a European winter where narrow-mindedness sets in, borders close and walls come up.

 I voted against the resolution tabled by the European right, as it promotes an ultraliberal vision of the EU’s trade relations with India. The right systematically opposed the amendments that I tabled on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament in order to rule out any liberalisation of public services, strongly condemn child labour, request legally binding clauses on corporate social responsibility and demand respect for the principle of equal pay for equal work with regard to Indians who will come and work in Europe in the future. The compromise was impossible, the differences of opinion obvious and irreconcilable. Only the resolution tabled by my group, together with those by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, offered a progressive vision of EU-India trade relations. Unsurprisingly, it could not hold out against the right-wing majority in Parliament, which is a shame. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 In anticipation of the EU-Japan Summit at the end of the month, Parliament has adopted this resolution stating its views on trade relations between the two partners. Unlike the European right, which spoke out very strongly in favour of opening negotiations on the conclusion of a free trade agreement, I defended a more cautious approach. Japan is a trade power that needs to be approached with caution when it comes to trade liberalisation. That is why my group opposed the present text presented by the European right and stressed the need to launch specific impact studies assessing the consequences of stronger trade relations for all the sectors concerned (in particular, the automotive sector) and for employment in Europe, before we open any negotiations. At the same time, we emphasised the problem of non-tariff barriers, which prevent European businesses from accessing Japanese public contracts. Indeed, it is wrong that the European Union, the region in the world that is most open to foreign investment, cannot operate on the markets of its industrialised partners under fair conditions.

 In the wake of the floods that devastated Pakistan in 2010, the Council called for emergency measures to support the country. I tabled an amendment rejecting the regulation proposed by the Commission, as trade preferences of this nature are a good idea in theory but not in practice. Our response to a humanitarian crisis cannot be based on trade, especially considering that it is now one year on from the disaster and the urgency is not as strong. This type of support is illogical and prejudicial, as some people in Europe, in particular those working in the textiles industry in several of the southern countries, will end up paying for support for Pakistan that we should all be paying for collectively. Furthermore, by only targeting certain industries, we are not helping all Pakistanis. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Since the Treaty of Lisbon, investment has been an area of exclusive EU competence. Parliament therefore initially gave its verdict on the shape of the future European investment policy. This is the report I myself drafted, which was voted on during the last part-session in April 2011. In Mr Schlyter’s report, Parliament has now examined transitional arrangements for managing investment agreements that Member States have already concluded with third countries. As in the vote in committee, I advocated a Community vision and stated that agreements that were already standing should be closely examined by the Commission in order to check their compatibility with the Treaties and with Union law and Union policy, in particular the objectives of the Union’s external action on sustainable development. However, the vision that has prevailed in the end is a right-wing vision in which protection of private investors is given priority over these objectives based on the general interest. Unfortunately the negotiations that will now be entered into with the Council are not likely to correct our aim, in an EU in which the good of the Union as a whole is rarely able to withstand national egotism. Kader Arif,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by sincerely thanking all those with whom I have had the opportunity to work on this issue. All the contributions have helped in the drafting of this report and, thanks to the cooperation of all the political groups, and I am especially grateful to the shadow rapporteurs, we have on the table today a consistent text that sends out a powerful message. Indeed, we are at a turning point in European investment policy and at a time when we have to seize the new power conferred on us by the Treaty of Lisbon in order to meet a dual challenge. Firstly, that of providing European businesses with the tools they need for high quality foreign investment that is protected by a legal framework providing long-term support. Secondly, Europe must strengthen its position as the world’s leading beneficiary of foreign direct investment and give itself the means to control that investment so as to encourage sustainable development that creates high quality employment. By voting on this report, the first official expression of our institution since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, Parliament is fully assuming its role as a new colegislator in trade regulatory matters and is voicing its priorities at a time when the first investment protection negotiations are about to begin. This expression is essential, because it is intended to relay the concerns of the citizens, who are showing a growing interest in trade matters and whom we must support. In a world, today, where conflicts also take place in a trade context, protecting those businesses of ours that invest abroad must become a priority. International agreements have been created to protect investors from harsh, unjustified expropriations and hidden laws aimed simply at eliminating them from this or that market. This primary objective must be maintained. Although Europe is one of the most open markets in the world, a balance must be restored with our main partners so that European businesses can benefit from a level playing field. This is the proposal made in this report, which stresses the need for future agreements to include standards relating to non-discrimination, fair and equitable treatment, and protection against direct and indirect expropriation. However, those standards must be defined in such a way as to prevent any misinterpretation. Some businesses have, in fact, used the vague wording in first-generation investment agreements to protect their interests beyond what is legitimate, for example, by attacking new social and environmental laws that harm their interests. Appearing before international arbitrators and with no transparency or possibility of appeal, they have demanded considerable compensation by claiming that those laws are on a par with indirect expropriation. Europe, which, in the future, will receive ever more investment, particularly from emerging countries, must guard against such abuses. That is the idea behind the reforms undertaken by the United States and Canada, two countries whose governments and authorities have suffered several setbacks in international arbitration cases and which have radically overhauled their investment agreement model. By proposing new definitions of protection standards, the report strikes a fair balance between the protection of investors’ rights and the right of public authorities to regulate. This also means including in all future agreements specific clauses laying down the possibility for public authorities to legislate and regulate in the areas of national security, the environment, public health, workers’ and consumers’ rights, industrial policy and cultural diversity. Lastly, increased protection for investors must be accompanied by more responsible behaviour, particularly in developing countries, where the social and environmental laws are less binding. That is why the report mentions that social and environmental clauses should be included in all free trade agreements signed by the Union. Furthermore, we must go beyond naming and shaming and include in all future agreements a set of clear corporate social responsibility rules with which businesses must comply and which are based on guidelines set by the OECD. If our aim here really is to shape the contours of a new European investment policy, then I call in this report for it to be exemplary and to promote investment which is sustainable, respects the environment and encourages good quality working conditions in Europe and in third countries alike. That is why this report, by the power vested in it by Wednesday’s vote, must serve as a reference for all future negotiations conducted by the Commission. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first allow to me to express the regret that it took a crisis in Europe to trigger the debate we are having today and the motion for a resolution we will vote on tomorrow. Just last year, when the developing countries rose up in what was called the ‘food riots’, Europe simply proposed emergency response measures, that is, to send seedlings and fertilisers, as though the problem were cyclical, when we have long been warning of structural problems. We have a common agricultural policy (CAP) that lacks effective regulatory mechanisms because the liberal majority still believes that nothing must restrict the market. There is widespread, economically destabilising and morally unacceptable speculation on agricultural products of developing countries that are prisoners of single-crop farming for export, with a Europe that does not support them and allocates only 4% of its development aid to the agricultural sector. With this resolution, Parliament as a whole finally acknowledges that the right to food is a basic human right, that it is unacceptable that the hunger of some is exploited for the benefit of others, that regulation is indispensable in ensuring price stability, and that trade agreements must preserve small family farms and the right to food. Today, Parliament is delivering a clear message. It is up to the Commission and the Council to translate it. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, it can never be said often enough that what is happening in the southern Mediterranean and, more generally, in the Arab world, is historic, especially for those peoples who, half a century after their countries gained independence through decolonisation, are today gaining their individual and collective freedoms. It is historic, but also unexpected, as are all popular revolutions, I hear you say. However, this new situation requires us to totally rethink our vision, our policies and our relationships with these countries. Proposals have been made. Indeed, the caution with which we have reacted to date is easily and worryingly explained by our obsession with stability, by which I mean that safety-first approach fuelled by our fears, an approach of which the sole priorities were the fight against immigration, terrorism and radical Islam, along with some economic interests, not least access to energy. We accepted authoritarian regimes, when their sole aim was to confirm our fears. The people’s revolt has made the failure of our policies plain to see; we no longer have the right to go on basing our analyses on the same fears, or, worse still, the same xenophobia-tinged beliefs. That is why we must stand side by side with those who aspire to greater freedom and democracy, in places where it is possible to be Muslim, democratic and secular. That is the message that we are being sent. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, until now I had suspected that peoples were always ahead of their political elites. Today I am quite sure of this. May I first of all pay tribute to the courage and determination of the Tunisian and Egyptian peoples. They have reminded us that the values that we stand for in the world – human rights and democracy – are not values exclusive to the West, as some proclaim, but rather are universal values shared by all. Europe, in my view, can no longer continue to make mistakes in this part of the world, shilly-shallying as it does from wrong analyses to misguided projects. These peoples are expecting a response from us that is equal to their courage and aspirations. They are not asking for charity but they are certainly asking for solidarity, and even more so for responsibility. In these uncertain times, nobody wants chaos, but nobody should have to accept the status quo any longer, either. We must support the hope created by the events in Tunisia and Egypt in order to help affirm and establish democracies that will benefit these countries and their populations, but which will also benefit us, and I believe that you have expressed this forcefully, Baroness Ashton. I shall conclude by quoting what a poet once said: ‘The world sleeps from a lack of imprudence.’ These peoples, quite rightly, have been imprudent in calling for their freedom, but I hope above all that they will have awakened our consciences. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the elections in Côte d'Ivoire have just taken place. The international community tolerated their being postponed year after year by the regime of Laurent Gbagbo. These successive reports alerted a number of us to the difficulties in which we find ourselves at the moment but, deep within ourselves, we hoped that the democratic spirit would prevail in a country that has suffered a great deal from sterile and unacceptable confrontations focused, in particular, around the concept of Ivorian nationality. The international community and, in particular, the European Union around Baroness Ashton and through my fellow Member, Mr Preda, mobilized to ensure that these elections took place under the best possible conditions, transparently and without violence. This should be commended. In view of the calm that prevailed and the atmosphere of mutual respect among candidates, the electoral campaign gave us cause to hope that the result would be accepted by all the parties. Today, unfortunately, the democratic result that emerged through the ballot box has been rejected by the outgoing President. Tomorrow, like my fellow Members, I will therefore vote in favour of appealing to Mr Gbagbo to accept that what appears to him to be a reversal of fortune or a conspiracy is, in fact, simply the will of the majority of his citizens. He cannot hang on to power without calling into question part of his own militant history, which was to appear, when resident in Europe, as the man who had brought about the newly regained freedom and democracy established in his country. The United Nations representative in Côte d'Ivoire courageously assumed his role and announced the results of the ballot. As First Vice-President of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I would also like to point out that a declaration was adopted by our Assembly on 3 December in Kinshasa firmly condemning the decision of the Ivorian Constitutional Council for invalidating the results. This declaration comes on top of the clear and unambiguous position taken by the leaders of the Member States of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and of the African Union. Today, the regime of Mr Gbagbo is neither wanted by its citizens, nor supported by its neighbours, nor accepted by the international community. It is therefore time that he accepted the victory of Alassane Ouattara, the democratically elected President of Côte d'Ivoire, who must be in a position to take on the responsibility entrusted to him by his people as soon as possible. Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to conclude by asking the European Union to assume its role through the means at its disposal to persuade Laurent Gbagbo and his illegitimate government to accept that the game is over. We will not allow his obstinacy to lead to chaos in Côte d'Ivoire. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the title of this debate is likely to create a certain optimism because in theory, it is about defining the procedures for helping banana-producing ACP countries. The reality is entirely different, and I have to say that the way they have been treated throughout this report is quite simply unacceptable. We must first and foremost bear in mind the fact that the banana sector is vital for many African and Caribbean countries. Yet, despite this, they have made the effort to accept, at the WTO, an agreement which lowers the European customs tariff to EUR 114 per tonne, in order to put an end to a long-standing dispute with Latin American producer countries. However, the Commission seems to have forgotten to inform them of the bilateral negotiations under way with these same countries on a far lower tariff: EUR 75 per tonne. In other words, the commercial consequences of these agreements will be deeply felt in a context in which the lion’s share of the European banana market is already held by multinationals based in Latin America. Faced with this situation, during the last plenary session of the ACP-EU Assembly in Tenerife, all the members agreed to adopt as one a declaration calling for support measures tailored to producers’ needs to be implemented without delay. Back in Brussels and Strasbourg, I see that, unfortunately – and this is no surprise – the right is backtracking and even opposing any reference to this declaration. I am tired of this double-dealing, but, above all, I fear that this weariness is shared by our historical partners, who no longer believe in our will to truly support their development. Kader Arif,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am always very happy to speak after Mr Fjellner, as I am always sure that I will not be in agreement with him. First, I should like to thank our rapporteur as well as all the shadow rapporteurs and, in particular, my friend Mr Susta, for their excellent work and their good cooperation on this text, which will finally enable a system of compulsory marking of origin on certain products imported into Europe to be introduced. I should like to thank you too, Commissioner, for your commitment. Our vote tomorrow will, in fact, be the first stage in the introduction of this regulation, which dates from 2005, and which the European Parliament has always supported and called for. Origin marking is an important step towards transparency and information, which we must constantly improve in favour of European citizens. Indeed, European consumers rightly want to know what they are purchasing, where the product comes from and under what conditions it was produced. They are therefore demanding to be able to consume in a more informed and, hence, responsible way. With this new regulation, we are responding to this demand, because our citizens will be better informed, in particular, of the social and environmental conditions under which the goods they purchase are produced. Contrary to what some people want to believe, the consumer is also a citizen, who agrees to pay more for quality European production, because this legislation is also essential for European companies, whose production is associated with a reputation for quality and high production standards. For those companies that have chosen to maintain production safeguarding know-how and employment in Europe, this regulation will re-establish a level playing field with our third-country trading partners. The text resulting from the vote of the Committee on International Trade is balanced, which is why, when it is voted on in tomorrow’s plenary, I call on the Members of this House not to call this balance into question and to support this text by voting overwhelmingly in favour of it. Kader Arif,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are clearly faced with a text whose complexity troubles many of us and, even more, in my opinion, the citizens of Europe. Commissioner, I asked for transparency and you responded. Today, I am somewhat concerned. Indeed, as I see it, beyond the purely technical issues, the main risk is that of the direction we are beginning to take with regard to this increasingly complex relationship between individual freedoms and the Internet. The world is changing rapidly, and we are all aware of this. We are all aware of the revolution taking place in access not only to information but also to culture via this tool. In today’s world, where such access is immediate and free, traditional reference points are being undermined. Our most complex task is, therefore, to define new regulations, because regulation is necessary not only to protect artists and rights holders; but I do not want to see individual freedoms ignored. As regards the protection of freedoms, one of the most important of which is the protection of the right to privacy, one of my main concerns is the possibility afforded by the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) of travellers’ personal effects and baggage being checked at borders. Does this mean that our mobile telephones, our MP3 players and our computers may be searched by customs authorities looking for illegally downloaded files? According to the Commission, this is just a possibility, because the precise term used in the text is not binding. It is said that the Member States may choose whether or not to allow their personal luggage to be searched. However, let us get serious here for a minute. How can one expect such wording not to be seen as incitement to carry out such checks? Do you really think that a government, especially if it is pressurised to some extent by its music industry – and I cite this example deliberately – will not take this opportunity afforded by ACTA to move its national legislation towards increased screening of passengers entering its territory? Another problem is that, if it is proved that the files held by a private individual are for commercial use, punishment is automatic. However, who determines whether the files we hold are of a commercial nature or not? Some may say that a person with 500 songs on his or her MP3 player necessarily has commercial objectives, but why would others deny themselves the opportunity to fix this limit at 300, 100, 50 or 10? In fact, for an ill-intentioned person, all it takes is to illegally download a single film in order to make thousands of copies of it, and that then becomes commercial activity. Finally, punishment will be meted out by the courts of each country, but a European citizen arrested by the border authorities of a signatory country on the basis of particularly binding legislation will have no means of challenging it. Is it your wish that such an abuse be possible? Was it not the responsibility of the Commission precisely to do everything it could to ensure that the agreement prohibits searches of personal effects? I have deliberately raised only this issue this evening, but you have raised many more, which we will incorporate into the resolution I have requested and which will ordinarily be voted on in next month’s plenary. Commissioner, I would ask you to take account of the outcome of this vote, which will be in line with our commitment, that is, to take account of the word of the European Parliament before you sign the act. Kader Arif,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

Mr President, Commissioner, here we are, finally, after many months of work, aiming to lay the foundations for the European Union’s future External Action Service but, like some of my fellow Members before me, I should like to thank the rapporteurs for the quality of their work. Since our shared vision is to see a real European diplomatic service which is not just an extension of the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States, the Financial Regulation and Staff Regulations, which we will discuss today and vote on tomorrow, are of paramount importance. They must give us the means to face a dual challenge: speaking with one voice on the international stage, but also guaranteeing consistency in all the Union’s external policies. With this in mind, trade policy does not fall within the High Representative’s mandate, but as a former trade commissioner, I have no doubt that she can establish the dialogue which is needed to ensure that trade policy, as specified in the treaty, observes the goals of the Union’s External Action Service, in particular, sustainable development, eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights. Lastly, I should like to stress that our shared political will will be measured by the budgetary resources earmarked; our ability to have political punch on the international stage depends on it. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, and as has just been pointed out, the Treaty of Lisbon strengthens Parliament’s powers. However, few of us are aware of the radical change that it brings about, particularly in the field of trade policy, which I follow closely. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament will ratify all international trade agreements. This is already causing quite a stir, and the discussions on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and on the free trade agreement with Korea are merely a first sign of this. However, the socialists and democrats in the Committee on Trade wanted to go further than the treaty allows. I am their spokesperson, and despite the scepticism of some and the opposition shown by certain others, I conveyed a clear message: if Parliament is to ratify any trade agreement, it must be involved from the start of the process. What used to seem idealistic is now a core element of our relations with the Commission, since we will be fully consulted on the negotiating mandates. I welcome this. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to continue to respect the Community spirit and the democratic will that are at the heart of the treaty. I also call on my fellow Members – since we suffer from a kind of Stockholm syndrome where the Commission and the Council are concerned – to use all our rights, because they are the rights of our fellow citizens. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, please allow me to make a general remark about this report which, in my opinion, is a reflection of our relationship with Turkey. Although I must congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their work, what I mean to say is that it is ambiguous. It reflects our indecision with regard to that country. As, one by one, the amendments were adopted, or otherwise, within the Committee on International Trade, an underlying – almost subliminal – issue, but one which was largely outside the scope of economic and commercial relations with Turkey, kept emerging: are we for or against that country’s accession to the EU? They reflect a kind of hesitation, which has not been taken on board: should Turkey be regarded as just another third country with which commercial relations might well be developed, or as an accession candidate, which thus imposes particular obligations which must be fulfilled by both parties? It is indeed difficult to say today whether this report accurately reflects the reality of our relations with that country, and especially whether it actually defines an EU strategy in this regard. It depends on which side of the fence we stand: do we simply want a privileged partnership, or do we want Turkey to actually accede? I should simply like to warn against the contradictory signals we are sending out. We cannot maintain an ambiguous approach with regard to our common destiny while, at the same time, worrying that Turkey seems to be distancing itself from the EU. A partnership requires frankness but it also requires trust. It requires frankness, because Turkey does, in fact, still need to make a great deal of effort to ensure root and branch reform and fulfil its undertakings. However, it also requires trust, which itself requires us to provide encouragement and send out positive signals. When the Turks voted to reform their constitution a few days ago, they also did what the EU is asking of them: they are gradually bringing their legislation into conformity with our standards so that they can become a fully fledged Member State. There is still a long way to go and a great deal of effort to be made, but let us refrain from creating additional obstacles and diverting our relationship from its aim, which is membership.

 Mr President, I can still only see good things emerging from a reform such as this, which is always highly complex. The signal indicating that the army is less powerful and that democracy is moving forward is, for me, an important signal sent out to the EU. One can always criticise and believe that certain things have not been done, but a step forward is still a step forward. I am not a pessimist by nature, and I think that all the actions taken by Turkey are along the right lines and that it is expressing a desire to accede. Let us therefore try to support it.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you have just said some reassuring things, but I still do not think that the concerns shared by a large number of Members about the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) have been completely dispelled. Back in March, I proposed a resolution, which was passed by a large majority in this Chamber, and which made it possible to publish the negotiating text. During the debate, we called for the acquis communautaire
 – which you have referred to – the safety and supply of generic medicines to be guaranteed and the fundamental freedoms of our fellow citizens to be respected. We also referred to geographical indications, and we did so in order to tell you our priorities, which I am going to keep on repeating to you so that the position which you will defend in a few weeks’ time in Japan is based on the parliamentary debate which we have managed to initiate. Yesterday, during the debate on the State of the Union, many speakers quite rightly pointed out that we MEPs are the spokespeople for our fellow citizens and that, without this link, the Commission is in danger of engaging in a sterile confrontation with Parliament. I am therefore asking you, Commissioner, to consider, as a priority, that the MEPs before you are first and foremost your partners and are not here to simply contradict you. The partnership we want is not one in which we are bound, as your services sometimes seem to want, by a vow of secrecy. Your services have just answered our questions behind closed doors. We are given the latest version of the ACTA text but we are prohibited from sending any messages when we leave these meetings or after we have read the agreement, whereas our role is to alert, explain and ensure things are understood. This is therefore my second request for you to regard the transparency of debates as an element which enriches your deliberations rather than as a breakdown of trust. In addition to these two main issues, and because I am starting to become accustomed to this type of exercise, I am going to inform you of my concerns. First of all, there is access to medicines. This has been mentioned. You tell us that protecting access is one of your priorities, that you are doing everything possible to ensure that nothing in this agreement hinders their manufacture or free movement. At this point, however, I would ask you about patents. Why do you want to include them in this agreement? The desire to step up the legitimate fight against counterfeiting should not be a pretext for using ACTA as a means of extending the rights of patentees way beyond what is set out in the TRIPS agreement. Please do not confuse generic medicines with counterfeit medicines. Another important point is safeguards. Texts cannot be too rigorous in ensuring a true balance between the rights of users and those of rights holders. I refer you to the various formulations contained in the TRIPS agreement. I welcome your comments about the Internet and I have great confidence in the idea that ACTA will not serve to weaken the EU position clearly expressed in the E-Commerce Directive. Commissioner, there are definitely other issues I should raise this morning, but the first duty I am setting myself is to ensure that, thanks to this debate, we are able to provide as much information as possible on this agreement to all our fellow citizens, and to tell you that the key element for me is the protection of their rights and their fundamental freedoms. This is why I expect you to bear in mind the points raised by Members and to defend them during the negotiations. I also call on you to honour your commitment to publish the text as soon as the negotiations have been completed, whether this is at the end of the round in Japan or at a subsequent stage. The public debate will have to take place, for example, in this Chamber. I shall therefore ask for a resolution, and we expect you to take our point of view into account before any signing of ACTA takes place, even if this means returning to the negotiating table.

 I voted today in favour of this resolution because it strongly condemns Israel’s attack on the humanitarian flotilla bound for Gaza, and demands that an international and impartial inquiry be carried out in order to shed all possible light on this deadly assault. This is a firm stance that demonstrates our common desire to see justice served, and I welcome that. For too long, Europe has been an economic giant, the leading provider of development aid to the region, but a political dwarf, incapable of having a decisive influence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict so as to enable a peaceful solution to be found. Today, thanks to the perseverance of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, this House is expressing its clear, strong position in favour of the immediate lifting of the Gaza blockade, which has resulted in a genuine humanitarian disaster. Europe must face up to its responsibilities. It has a duty to play a decisive political role in order to finally achieve concrete results in view of the creation of a viable Palestinian state.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial, economic and social crisis that we are going through is unprecedented. It is hitting our continent and its peoples hard, it is causing huge social and human difficulties, and Greece, unfortunately, is a harsh and shameful example of this for us. Unemployment is constantly rising. Already, millions of Europeans are jobless, and the figure is rising from one day to the next. The response must be political, strong, swift and coordinated, and it must take into account the serious environmental crisis that we are going through, which requires a new development model. These many crises give rise, among our fellow citizens, to a great deal of expectation and to a hope to which the Europe 2020 strategy should have responded. However, in the face of these challenges on an exceptional scale, the response has not materialised, and I regret that. The guidelines laid down in March by the European Council are not up to the task. There is no determination, no ambition, but, unfortunately, that does not surprise me any more. Everywhere, you Members of the Council and of the Commission, you and your Commissioners boast about the consistency of your policies. However, I have the impression that this is just an umbrella concept to disguise your lack of action. You do not have a consistent strategy combining economic, social, trade, industrial, agricultural or research policies to guarantee sustainable and fair development. Moreover, the external dimension of European trade-related action is nowhere to be found or is under the auspices of the untouchable liberal ‘global Europe’ dogma. We want trade to be a proper instrument that helps to create jobs and growth, to combat poverty and to promote development. However, you are pursuing – not for technical reasons, but for political reasons – a different objective: you are racing to reduce costs and to cut wages, you are racing to conclude bilateral free trade agreements to the detriment of multilateralism, thereby causing social and fiscal dumping. That policy is responsible for too many job losses, too many relocations and too much social damage to carry on as it is. To conclude, we expect the Commission and the Council to rekindle the European spirit, and to reject national self-interest so as to make Europe a haven not just of prosperity, but of solidarity too. Ensuring that Europe projects a different image of itself not only to its own citizens, but also to the rest of the world: that is what the resolution by the Group of the Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is all about.

The resolution on ACTA, which has been adopted today and of which I am one of the initiators, is extremely symbolic because it is unanimous. It is a clear signal sent out to the Commission, which has been negotiating this agreement in the utmost secrecy for two years. Parliament demands complete transparency with regard to the negotiations under way, as well as respect for the treaties, which entitle it to receive the same information as the Council. Whether in terms of the method or in terms of what we know of the substance, I am opposed to the way in which the ACTA negotiations are being conducted. We have many fears with regard to the calling into question of the acquis communautaire
. Aside from the risk of reintroducing the ‘flexible’ response, respect for the fundamental rights of citizens, in terms of freedom of expression and of protection of privacy and of data, and the principle of non­liability of Internet access providers and hosts could be called into question. Parliament has already proved its commitment to these principles, and if the Commission does not change its strategy, I will lead the campaign against the ratification of ACTA by Parliament, as we have already been able to do for the SWIFT Agreement.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is currently experiencing an unprecedented crisis which, beyond the economic and financial crisis, represents first and foremost a crisis of the system. Even before beginning to deal with the effects of the economic crisis on world trade, which forms the topic of our debate, I wish to clarify one point: trade is not a victim of the crisis; it is also one of its contributing factors. Indeed, we are currently experiencing a period of huge global imbalances, fuelled, on the one hand, by certain countries’ excessive trade deficits at the cost of growing domestic indebtedness and, on the other, by trade surpluses stimulated by the exports of certain, especially emerging, countries with internal consumption that is not growing at the same rate. Moreover, the trade liberalisation policy conducted thus far has only exacerbated these imbalances, weakening, in particular, the poorest countries on the planet. These countries, which have been encouraged to specialise in export monocultures, have therefore found themselves destitute in the face of extreme fluctuations in the prices of raw materials, the volatility of which has increased as a result of international speculation. It is a strange world that sets as its first Millennium Development Goal the eradication of poverty and hunger but then, at the same time, speculates on the rise in wheat prices. However, the very people who defended liberalisation and deregulation at any cost in the 1990s are now finding themselves in a difficult situation as well. The continual rise in job losses, stagnant, sometimes even negative, growth, and the developing social crisis are all factors that mean we can no longer afford to let jobs disappear in the name of this cult. In a period of crisis, how do we explain to employees who are losing their jobs that the main thing is to maintain deregulated trade, even at the cost of sudden and sometimes tragic relocations? The crisis we are going through is therefore definitely a systemic crisis, to which we must respond with a new development model. In its current Global Europe strategy, the vision developed by the Commission is essentially based on access to the market and the liberalisation of all sectors. Commissioner, I believe we need to redefine this strategy, which has been on the wrong track and sometimes led to setbacks. It is not by forcing developing countries to open up even more that we will revive our industries’ exports. That would only aggravate the situation in those countries, which already accommodate 70% of the 59 million people in the world who lost their jobs in 2009. On the contrary, it is essential to consider a new strategy that strikes the right balance between openness, protection and support. I would like to return to these ideas. We cannot ignore these developments, which lead the United States to make further use of its trade defence tool or China to take issue with the WTO over European anti-dumping measures. Indeed, when we are faced with unfair practices, it is clear that protection is necessary, but the principle of it must be accepted and defended internationally and the sometimes false accusations of protectionism dismissed once and for all. Moreover, the need for support for trade policies is becoming more obvious every day, and such support depends, in particular, on the policies implemented by the Union being genuinely consistent. Consistency in policies is not an intellectual debate, but an absolute necessity if we want to redefine a new development model. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in September, we were already debating in plenary the free trade agreement between the European Union and Korea. There were already many of us who expressed our fears about the negative consequences of this agreement, especially with regard to the automobile sector. We did not think that events would prove us right so quickly. On 21 January, Opel announced the closure of its Anvers site, the production activities of which will be relocated to South Korea. Are we to believe that this decision has nothing to do with the free trade agreement that has just been negotiated? Allow me to spot a connection there. During this period of economic crisis in which the workers are the first to pay for the mistakes of the financiers, the Commission is duty-bound to consider, now more than ever, the job-related consequences of the agreements that it negotiates. It is no longer possible to give a simplistic response to these employees, for whom we know full well it will be very difficult to find another job. We cannot say to them that international trade is a game of winners and losers and that, unfortunately, they are the ones who will be sacrificed and that we can do nothing about it. We expect answers from you today, Commissioner. First of all, we want to know whether your Directorate-General has assessed the impact of this agreement on jobs in Europe, for I must tell you that the figure greedily announced, that is, the EUR 19 billion profit that European exporters are expected to make, does not convince us. Where does this figure come from? On what study is it based? Leaving aside the expected positive effects, however, have the negative effects also been taken into account? The Commission has drafted a regulation on the methods for implementing safeguard measures within the context of this agreement. These methods relate, in particular, to duty drawback, an advantage that has never before been conceded, not even to our developing trade partners. The proposals put forward provide for complicated procedures for invoking and enforcing the safeguard clauses. Nevertheless I feel reassured because, for the first time ever, Parliament will soon be able to express an opinion on this text under the ordinary legislative procedure. I would, however, like to point out that Europe’s employment problem will not be solved by palliative measures taken on a case-by-case basis. That is why I, together with my whole group, am calling for a real European industrial policy, one that represents a genuine strategy for the future of our industries, to be drawn up at last. In a context of economic crisis and of intensified global competition, this industrial policy must be coordinated effectively with the common trade policy so that our free trade agreements do not lead to job cuts in Europe. A second matter on which we expect clarification is that of the protocol on cultural cooperation included in the agreement. Several Member States have reacted very harshly to the negotiations initiated with Korea, a country that has failed to ratify the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. I condemn the very principle of initiating negotiations on this topic, and I believe that cultural issues should be handled separately from trade negotiations and placed in the hands of the Commissioner for Culture so as to prevent this matter from becoming a negotiating item under the same heading as conventional goods or services. To conclude, Commissioner, you know how essential it is for MEPs to be kept fully informed of the negotiations under way and to be involved at all stages, including from the point at which the negotiating mandate is defined. Leaving aside our differences in approach, I would like to point out that better upstream consultation of Parliament would have made it easier for us to understand the strategy being pursued. I therefore trust I can count on your support and on that of your Commission to assist us in our future work, with everyone acting within the scope of his responsibilities, but always for the benefit of a trade policy that is obviously more European in scope, but that is, above all, fairer. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, trade policy is going to be a major factor in the Union’s external policy. Unfortunately, this trade policy is today the symbol of the disappearance of Community interest, since it is nothing other than the addition of national interests. At a time when we want Europe to defend its values – solidarity, social justice – when we want Europe to be able to integrate into its trade agreements social rights, environmental rights, the protection of human rights and the protection of trade union rights, we realise that the Commission’s only proposal to us is to conclude agreements in which it is felt that there is no alternative to the market and trade and that they are an end in themselves. This, as far as my political family is concerned, is unacceptable. At a time when we want this trade policy to be able to integrate industrial policy and the effects that it may have on employment policies, we realise that the Commission has given no guarantees on these points in the comments made this morning by the President of the Commission. Unfortunately, however, this does not surprise me. Nothing has been said about the horizontal social clause, about the protection of public services, about the way to see Europe change policy again or have a totally different policy. To conclude my remarks on these issues, Mr Barroso, I believe that trust is built within a two-way relationship. With your comments this morning, you have not offered us what we need to put our trust in you. Please note that, since you have not provided these guarantees, I cannot guarantee that we will put our trust in you. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Zapatero, Mr Buzek, ladies and gentlemen, in this period of crisis, trade policy occupies an ever more important place in public debate, as Europeans are increasingly finding that the trade strategy introduced at Union level has a direct impact on growth and employment. Against a background of increased international competition, the race for reduced costs has led to too many job losses or relocations. In the face of this situation, our group considers that trade must be a tool to serve objectives such as job creation, the reduction of inequalities and sustainable development. During his hearing, the Commissioner for Trade, Mr De Gucht, appeared to agree that trade could not be an end in itself. I should therefore like to know if, in the course of your Presidency, you will support a reform of European trade policy to ensure that it creates more jobs and is linked more closely to a true industrial policy. Will you also take action to support fair trade at world level, fair trade that is capable of promoting development, decent work and respect for human rights? In other words, will you introduce binding social and environmental standards into our agreements? Kader Arif,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we have an opportunity today to talk about the anti-homosexual draft legislation submitted to the Ugandan Parliament on 25 September. At a time when we are seeing an increasing number of human rights violations, I feel it is crucial, in the light of this anti-freedom law, for the European Parliament to look beyond the divisions that separate its political families and be able to condemn this bill in the strongest possible terms and to call on the Ugandan Parliament to reject the bill and to review its national legislation in order to decriminalise homosexuality. As Mr Cashman pointed out just now, every single NGO has spoken out against this bill, regarding it, moreover, as a serious obstacle to the fight against AIDS. The Commission, through Commissioner De Gucht, and a large majority of the Member States – adding their voice to the statements made by President Obama – have already condemned this initiative. I therefore call on the Commission to rethink our involvement with Uganda if this bill is adopted. A country that, at that point, would be in violation not only of international law but also of the fundamental principles of the Cotonou agreements could not continue to benefit from the support of the European Union. To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to point out that everyone must have the right to freedom of sexual orientation, without fear of imprisonment or death. This principle is not open to debate. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Doha Round was clear. It was supposed to be a round to promote development, a round allowing developing countries to correct the imbalances created by the liberal policies implemented to date within the framework of the notorious Washington Consensus. It is not surprising – although I deplore the fact – that during this crisis period, positions favouring equitable trade are on the retreat. In the face of the United States, which will not move until the health reform has been passed, and in the context of growing opposition from trade unions and the main industrial lobby groups, Europe is not managing to shift the boundaries, and it is therefore unlikely that an agreement will be reached soon. The majority within this Parliament is therefore taking advantage of the fact to return to its ideology, that of aggressive trade, based solely on the interests of gaining greater market access. Blame the crisis. In acting in this way, in seeking, above all, the opening up of the markets and the removal of all barriers to trade, those on the right wing are, in addition, completely forgetting that it is in our interests to have strong trade partners that are fully integrated into the system of world trade. The reality is that no developing country could end up strengthened by such an agreement. Together with Mr Désir, our group’s rapporteur on this resolution, we have tabled several amendments to the joint compromise text produced by the right-wing European political parties. Of course, I would like to see my own group’s resolution adopted, but this will not happen. That is why our amendments make several points. Firstly, it is absolutely vital that public services remain outside the framework of the negotiations, because they relate to people’s fundamental needs and cannot be left to the markets. Next, special treatment should be given to products which are sensitive for developing countries, particularly in the agricultural sphere. The food crisis has been swept out of people’s minds by the arrival of the financial and economic crisis. Let us not forget that food sovereignty should be our absolute priority, the first of the Millennium Development Goals. Finally, we believe that the public intervention area in developing countries should be maintained, not only by ruling out any liberalisation of public contracts, but also by protecting new industries. These few points, which are not an exhaustive list, are the absolute minimum in order to ensure that the Doha Round will truly promote development. If they do not appear in the final text, I will call upon my group to vote against it. (Applause) Kader Arif,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Moreira for his speech. On 9 December, the Euro-Mediterranean trade ministers will meet to debate the revival of our economic and trade cooperation. Firstly, I would like us all to be clear about something: if the aim of the free trade area was indeed to benefit all of the partners, from the North and from the South, setting 2010 as the date on which it will be introduced was neither realistic nor even desirable, given that there are still huge disparities in development terms between the north and the south sides of the Mediterranean. Moreover, some people are still advocating the fact that, to make progress with the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership – which I would remind you is made up of three pillars: politics, economics, and society and culture – we simply need to brush aside the political difficulties in order to make headway with the economic and trade aspect. As you will have gathered, I do not believe in this magical and pernicious view that trade alone can help us progress towards harmonious integration, peace and stability. I believe in it even less since the facts speak for themselves. For example, the Union for the Mediterranean, in brushing aside the political conflicts, was supposed to revive stagnant Euro-Mediterranean cooperation with so-called concrete and visible projects. Today, it is the Union for the Mediterranean that is stagnating, and the political disputes that have gone unmentioned have come back to haunt it. I am among those who are fiercely attached to the spirit of the Barcelona Process, who believe that progress is not measured solely by trade statistics, which are, incidentally, still too unfavourable to our partners from the South, to their populations. Trade for trade’s sake – no, I definitely do not believe in it. On the other hand, trade that is focused on development and aimed at reducing the gap between rich and poor, at ensuring that prosperity really is shared and that regional integration exists – yes, I can conceive of that. However, the negotiations still need to be steered in this direction. That is why, at this next meeting, I ask that we all be ambitious, that we not just discuss technical matters to do with the removal of barriers to trade, as though that were the aim. It is unacceptable to go on thinking that way. Regional integration, particularly in terms of the South-South network, the solutions to be adopted for the economic crisis – which is having a severe impact with its associated job losses – human, social and environmental considerations, and the human rights issue must sustain the discussions and become our main concerns once again. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, I had not anticipated having to respond to Mrs Dodds but I would just like to tell her that she should read the Treaty of Lisbon because, if there is one committee that will be strengthened by the Treaty of Lisbon, it is the Committee on International Trade. Therefore I can say that, when that time comes, the European Parliament will have slightly more influence in the months or years ahead. Mr Moreira put some very precise questions to the commissioner. I heard Mr Tajani answer: Libya and Syria. There was one issue that was, all the same, disposed of very quickly, and that was the whole human rights issue, on which there has been no precise response. I very much want there to be progress in the negotiations with Libya and Syria but, at the same time, precise answers must be given to the EU’s questions, enquiries and requests regarding human rights. My second point is that I feel it is impossible to talk about the Euro-Mediterranean area without raising the Israel-Palestine issue, when we see products being imported today from the occupied territories. I would therefore also like to know where the Commission stands on this issue. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not our first debate on origin marking but, as I am sure that repetition has its benefits, I will take the liberty of joining my fellow Members in stressing the need for European legislation on ‘made in’ origin marking. Indeed, in spite of the opinion expressed by this House in 2005, then in 2007, via the vote on the resolution by our colleague, Mr Barón Crespo, the lack of a majority within the Council has always prevented the adoption of this regulation. However, a text such as this would represent a crucial advance, not only for European consumers, but also for our industries. Indeed, by indicating the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries, consumers would be fully informed of the characteristics of the product they are buying. In such sensitive sectors as clothing, leather goods and furniture, creating the conditions for consumers to make an informed choice is a major issue for those companies that have taken the decision to maintain production in Europe, preserving European knowledge and European jobs. I therefore welcome the proposal that you have just made, Commissioner, but I am anxious to stress that this proposal must remain ambitious. Seeking the support of a majority of Member States must not be done at the expense of our ultimate goal. For example, it would be unacceptable for origin marking to concern only finished products, thus making it possible to import all the components separately, to assemble them in Europe and to describe them as being ‘made in Europe’. Moreover, I would like to support the Commission’s efforts to derive maximum benefit from such an agreement. Therefore, without coming back to a repeated request to improve and to simply the rules of origin, the possibility of creating a pan-Euro-Mediterranean mark would be a significant advance in terms of strengthening sectors built around the Mediterranean and South-South trade. Lastly, I should like to stress that, as part of the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Committee on International Trade will see its powers substantially increased. The Commission will therefore be able to count – I assure you, Commissioner – on the full commitment of MEPs to monitor closely the discussions on this crucial regulation for European consumers and workers. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis that we are going through is profound and long lasting. It is therefore urgent and absolutely essential to put in place the necessary regulations and supervision of the financial sector and the banks, to prevent an even more drastic repeat of today’s crisis. The financial system must once again serve the real economy and not continue to destroy it. From this point of view, the last G20 Summit in London, which has been mentioned, ended in what were, to say the least, partial proposals, but, above all, the words have not been turned into deeds, and the financial drift is there once again. In view of this situation, and so that the Pittsburgh G20 Summit really is useful, the European Union must defend strong regulatory measures that have real consequences. Beyond the essential measures to supervise finance listed by a number of my fellow Members, I personally would like to raise the issues of trade and development, because in Pittsburgh there will also be talk of relaunching the Doha Round. Relaunch it, yes, but with the condition that the initial and central objective of this Round, that is to say development, is not sidelined again. Our southern partners, quite rightly, will not accept that their concerns continue to remain unanswered. The issue at stake in this G20 goes beyond that of the financial crisis: it is about laying the foundations of new global governance. Kader Arif,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to hear a conservative and a liberal fellow Member agree with the Commission; it makes my job as a socialist easier. I hope, in any case, that this evening’s debate will make it possible at last to address the many concerns regarding the impact of this free trade agreement between the European Union and Korea and, in particular, on European industry. You spoke of a consensus but, Commissioner, I would remind you that, for some months now, certain industrial sectors – including car manufacturers and workers’ unions, which support them – have been warning you of the possible tragic consequences of this agreement. Today, the bulk of these issues have still not been addressed. It may be the case, however, that you have chosen to sacrifice the European car industry for the benefit of services. Indeed, why allow Korea to have duty drawback, which is a benefit that has never been granted before, not even to developing countries such as the countries of the Mediterranean? What is the logic behind flexible rules of origin, the impact of which is to be feared, not only for the car industry, but also for the European textile industry? Why allow such distortions of competition and, above all, why set this precedent? In the face of these risks, and, unfortunately, of others, which I cannot expand on here but the details of which you know – you have just mentioned them – the Commission has proposed a last resort, the inclusion of a safeguard clause. However, you know, Commissioner, that the safeguard clause is not automatic and that it will be very difficult to implement and impossible to activate for five years. I will cite just one example to illustrate our fears. If the free trade agreement allows Korea to export 100 000 additional vehicles to Europe – it already exports 600 000 of them annually – 6 000 jobs will be lost. Conversely, Europe is terribly restricted, with each manufacturer being able to export just 1 000 vehicles to Korea, as part of a total European quota of 6 000 vehicles. At this time of crisis, which is having a particular effect on car workers, how do you explain Europe’s committing itself to such an agreement? Do you envisage a renegotiation of the controversial points that I have just mentioned? This is what a number of Member States and industrial sectors that I have just mentioned are calling for, anyway. Will you commit yourself at last, Commissioner, to ensuring greater transparency and to involving us MEPs to a greater extent? We, and the Commission, created the conditions for a negative image of the Polish plumber; let us not create a negative image of the Korean coach builder. Kader Arif (S&amp;D).

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by joining with the previous speakers in condemning in the harshest possible terms the coup d’état 
staged against the government of President Zelaya in Honduras. His arbitrary detention and his expulsion from the country are in breach of the constitutional order, which must be restored as quickly as possible. The military overthrow that led to Roberto Micheletti proclaiming himself as the new president brings to mind the darkest periods in the history of Central America that we have known, and this attack on democracy is unacceptable in our view. I therefore welcome the Organization of American States’ decision to suspend Honduras’ involvement in the organisation, and the acceptance of President Oscar Arias as a mediator helping to find a solution. However, I am also very concerned, Commissioner, about the commercial relations that the European Union maintains with this country. For several months negotiations have been taking place between the European Commission and Central America on a new-generation association agreement. Following the coup d’état
, meetings planned last week have been cancelled. We should be glad about that. I thought I understood you, but I should like to have more details. Is the Commission determined to suspend the negotiations until the institutional political situation in Honduras has returned to normal? That is what I and my political group are asking, but I should like to have more details concerning the Commission’s position on this point. Another issue that I wish to raise, Commissioner, is that of the Generalised System of Preferences Plus, from which Honduras benefits. Several organisations from civil society have reported arbitrary decisions and human rights violations since the coup d’état
, particularly as regards freedom of movement, association and expression. The European Commission has to be very firm on this issue. The GSP+ is an incentive, the benefits of which are dependent on clear commitments. The testimonies are more than enough to cast doubt on whether the State of Honduras is fulfilling its commitments under its self-proclaimed president. I therefore call on the Commission to launch an investigation into the possibility of temporarily withholding the preferences granted to Honduras under the GSP+. Karim Zéribi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is proposing that we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the single market and forge further ahead with its completion. In the field of transport, two areas are identified in Single Market Act II: rail and maritime transport. I am surprised not to see cabotage services provided by road, scheduled for 2013, mentioned here. This will have a massive impact on the environment and lead to more social dumping than is the case at present. I would like to think this was an oversight, though one might consider it a deliberate error. Commissioner, you can be very pleased with the achievements of the last 20 years, but you cannot hide the reality of the social landscape or the crisis affecting Europe on the job front. As far as the forthcoming reforms in both the maritime and the rail sectors are concerned, these are based on a one-size-fits-all approach, that of liberalisation. Commissioner, this headlong rush has to stop. The single market is not dogma. It is a tool that should serve economic development, environmental transition and the social wellbeing of our fellow citizens. We cannot reasonably take any more without introducing social and fiscal harmonisation measures that are effective with any future directive. There has to be a level playing field for everyone. My group will, in particular, be making sure that we avoid the abuses of the past and, for every area where the market is being liberalised, will demand that a social and environmental package be introduced so that competition is fair and brings development and prosperity for our continent. Karim Zéribi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to draw your attention to the issue of the Roma minority, which is very topical in France and in Europe. The European Union has, to its credit, invested heavily in its programmes to integrate the Roma populations. More than EUR 17 billion will be allocated over the period 2007-2013 via the European Social Fund (ESF), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and, to a lesser extent, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). However, there are numerous indications that these funds have been under-utilised. In Marseille, the city in which I was elected, 1 500 Roma live in inhumane and revolting conditions, which creates tensions. Expelling the Roma does not resolve their situation at all and does not address the real issue, which is their integration. We must act. Commissioner, you say that the integration of the Roma, who are Europeans, is as much the responsibility of the host country as it is of the country of origin. You are right. However, we must therefore strengthen control over the use of EU subsidies and ensure that the Commission reassesses, if necessary, the national strategies adopted. Furthermore, we should entrust the management of Structural Funds granted today to locally elected bodies, which will have an interest in solving the problem because they are closer to the citizen. Parliament will then have to ensure that the use of these funds is assessed regularly. Liem Hoang Ngoc,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the euro area is again entering recession. The exit strategy advocated by the Council and the Commission until last June has plunged us into crisis. Euroscepticism is gaining ground. In this context, the Van Rompuy report, which must define the next stage of economic and monetary union, has particular significance. Sadly, the Council has refused to involve Parliament fully in drafting this roadmap. Ms Thyssen’s report is therefore the opportunity for Parliament to invite itself to the debate in order to send a strong message. I salute the remarkable work done by Ms Thyssen, who has demonstrated the sort of constructive attitude that shows our fellow citizens that Parliamentary debate has a point. The point of this debate is to take stock of the levers so desperately lacking for the functioning of economic and monetary union. Firstly, an integrated banking union is needed to control the banks, guarantee deposits and resolve crises without taxpayers again having to foot the bill. Secondly, a budgetary union is needed, within which the serious budgetary approach of Member States is matched by support for sustainable development on a European scale. This union must be given a budgetary capacity fuelled by new own resources, allocation of which must be debated within the framework of the Union method, this being the only way to guarantee solidarity among the 27 Member States. Thirdly, a genuine democratic leap is needed, without which transfers of sovereignty will continue to be seen by our fellow citizens as so many powers commandeered by bureaucrats. Parliament, as the main agent of representative democracy, must therefore play a part at each stage of the European Semester. Parliament must be involved in the functioning of the European stability mechanism. Parliament must be able to monitor the troika, particularly when the International Monetary Fund itself declares that the troika has made a serious error. Last but not least, a social – fifth – pillar is needed to guarantee wage standards, preventing structural reforms from causing a recessionary spiral. A social pillar to prevent budgetary discipline from reducing the quality of public services and social protection. A social pillar to encourage integration of young people into the labour market and access to housing for all. A social pillar to reassure our fellow citizens, for whom Europe is synonymous with saving the banks on the one hand, but worsening most people’s circumstances on the other. That is the strong mandate that Parliament must give its President on the eve of the November and December Council meetings. The Council will hear this message even more clearly if tomorrow it receives – thanks to you, ladies and gentlemen– the largest possible majority. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, the October Council decided on a timetable for the implementation of June’s decisions. The banking union will therefore see the light of day in 2014. It will allow us to supervise 6 000 banks in the euro area. It will guarantee deposits and be responsible for resolving banking crises. This will prevent the taxpayers from having to pay the price once again, because the citizens, and workers in particular, are not the culprits responsible for the crisis; the real criminals are the greedy financiers. They have taken the role of police, accusing the citizens of always wanting too many social elements. However, the social pillar is exactly what is missing from your interim road map, Mr Van Rompuy; that and the democratic pillar. As a result, many of our citizens are becoming more Eurosceptic today. The members of the EP’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs affirmed in the Thyssen report that there cannot be genuine economic and monetary union without democracy and without a social pact. The European Parliament must have its say at each stage of the European Semester. It must be able to discuss the troika’s decisions. It must be involved in the European Stability Mechanism governance structure. Finally, budgetary discipline must, in each Member State, be accompanied by a substantial European budgetary capacity in order to deal with asymmetric shocks, as you say yourself, Mr Van Rompuy. However, this counter-cyclical fund must be financed using new, sustainable resources, and it must be managed under the Community method in order to prevent the collapse of the Union. Ladies and gentlemen, many of us agree that there cannot be a successful federal transition without solidarity, without social progress and without democratic progress. That is the message that our Parliament and its President must spread in the ongoing debate. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the ‘two-pack’ applies to France, as it does to most countries in the euro area. France, however, has just issued its latest government bonds at historically low rates. It has to get its economy growing again so as to reduce its deficits and continue to benefit from such rates. To that end, Ms Ferreira raises the possibility of proactive investment policies by proposing, like Mario Monti, to change the way deficits are calculated so as to distinguish the role of public investment. She also supports the creation of eurobonds, which are needed to curb speculation. Since the future of the euro is at stake, the conservatives would be taking on a serious responsibility if they rejected the amendments and compromises, including these two proposals. As for the Gauzès report, by generalising the reversed qualified majority principle, it places all the power in the hands of the Commission, whose recommendations are particularly controversial not only in Greece but also in France and elsewhere. The democratic debate should not be closed. Parliament should have the right to veto the Commission’s decisions. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has moved on to practical work and we have tried to improve its draft text in committee. We now have a basis of assessment including exchange transactions, derivatives, equities and bonds traded on the secondary market. Like the Commissioner, we want the financial transaction tax to be imposed on pension funds and undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), which, unfortunately, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wants to exclude. We also have two tax rates, including a lower rate for derivatives, which seems paradoxical given that we want to combat speculation. By and large, however, the compromise we are reaching will be an important step forward, especially if it obtains a large majority in plenary. This would send a strong signal to the Council, where political change in France is opening up new possibilities for European growth initiatives, funding for which could be achieved through the mobilisation of this first European tax instrument. This places the burden fairly and squarely on the financial sector, which is responsible for the crisis, and not on its victims, European citizens. The tax revenue will also help reduce the contribution of the Member States, which are being asked to reduce their deficit. In this way, Parliament is suggesting that it is not impossible to reconcile fiscal justice, deficit reduction and support for growth. This is a good omen, ladies and gentlemen, ahead of the informal European Council summit on growth, which is opening this evening. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Audy, would you include tax cuts in the public finances audit that you are proposing? Liem Hoang Ngoc,

 Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur for the political will she has displayed in this report. We all know that some Member States manipulate their corporate tax base more or less secretly to reduce their real level of taxation and practise tax dumping. That is why we, as socialists and federalists, have always supported the idea of moving towards tax harmonisation in the European Union. Unfortunately, by proposing a consolidated base that was merely optional, the European Commission did not seek to take a first step towards harmonising corporate tax, but simply to create a tax optimisation instrument. This was not acceptable to our political grouping, since the Europe we believe in is not a self-service Europe serving only corporate interests.
 It is, above all, a political and social Europe built for all, involving everyone. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I have fought for months to change the logic of the Commission’s text radically, namely, to move from a voluntary to a compulsory system and introduce a minimum level of taxation. Negotiations were not easy but we succeeded in reaching agreement because, beyond our political differences – which are significant – all of us around the table shared an ambitious vision of Europe. Despite her initial reluctance, the rapporteur ultimately accepted the principle of a compulsory common consolidated corporate tax base for all large companies in the EU. Unfortunately, we did not manage to establish a minimum rate but the report clearly identifies the problems posed by too large a spread in rates and calls for the issue of rates to be re-examined when reviewing the application of this text. We will monitor this closely, because for us, it is an indispensable second phase. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I call on you to give overwhelming support to Ms Thyssen’s report. In doing so, we will send a strong message to the Council and, above all, to citizens, who are the first to suffer from the evils of tax competition. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr Gauzès, you speak of the sovereignty of the people, but you have also spoken of the ‘two-pack’ for which you are the rapporteur. You want to transpose – and I am talking to you about a European text – you want to transpose a treaty into secondary European legislation. You want to transpose the treaty of austerity together with its symbol, the leaden rule. It is a leaden rule that will plunge Europe into recession, as my fellow Member, Mr Canfin, said. You want to transpose this leaden rule into secondary legislation even before the peoples of Europe have been able to take a decision and ratify the treaty. Mr Gauzès, my question is a simple one: you speak of the sovereignty of the people, so are you going to withdraw your Amendment 9 from this ‘two-pack’, which shows true contempt for democracy?

) The intergovernmental treaty that the European governments are about to sign is unacceptable for two reasons. It is unacceptable in terms of the procedure adopted, which is anti-democratic and rides roughshod over half a century of the Community method. It is also unacceptable in terms of content, in that it is aimed at tightening the already suffocating straitjacket of the Stability Pact and imposing unprecedented austerity policies throughout Europe. These policies can do nothing but plunge us into a lasting recession, destroy our social model and make the poorest citizens pay the price for a crisis of which they are the first victims. They will not resolve the debt problem as austerity will kill consumption and investment and, with them, any hope of growth or the recovery of public finances. The fact the ECB has just granted the banks a loan of EUR 489 billion for three years at 1% interest, while Greece has a knife put to its throat, is proof that Europe has currently got things completely the wrong way round. Curiously, these banks are not suspected of ‘moral hazard’, in contrast to the Member States, which the ECB is not allowed to finance directly. They will therefore be able to buy back sovereign bonds at 6 or even 10% and continue their speculative activities with this free money. This is not the Europe we want. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 The new Treaty that the German right intends to push through would deprive the Member States of a budgetary policy by forcing them to implement austerity policies that are set to plunge Europe into recession without reducing deficits. Economic policy choices would be enshrined in the constitutions and placed under the authority of a Court of Justice. Automatic penalties would be applied to countries whose public deficit exceeds 3% of their GDP. However, this Treaty fails to include any measures for resolving the economic and social crisis: there is nothing about Eurobonds or about the ECB intervening on the primary market to purchase government bonds. Therefore, how can anyone be surprised about the rise in euroscepticism? We urgently need to show that a progressive economic strategy is possible. We call for the creation of a European treasury, the embryo of which could be the European Financial Stability Facility, and for an independent rating agency, attached to the European Court of Auditors. The power to rate sovereign debts would be taken away from private agencies, in which there are obvious conflicts of interest. We also propose the creation of an investment pact to revive the economy through the exclusion of investment expenditure from the calculation of public deficits. With an EU budget swelled by Eurobonds and the financial transaction tax, we would fund the upwards convergence of competitiveness levels and social and fiscal rules. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Draghi, ladies and gentlemen, this annual report has finally broken certain taboos. It calls on the Commission to create a European credit rating foundation and to consider temporarily suspending credit ratings for countries that require support from the Union. The report recognises the merit of the European Central Bank (ECB) repurchasing bonds on the secondary market, which has allowed banks to maintain their balance sheets and continue to borrow on the interbank market. This action prevented a liquidity crisis. Yet in order to resolve the sovereign debt crisis, the ECB needs to be authorised to intervene on the primary market when it becomes illiquid. Even Germany is struggling to obtain funds. Italian bonds are being issued at ever-higher rates. If there is no intervention, the risk of Italy defaulting will seriously compromise the health of the banks. The banks will approve fewer loans and will not be able to meet the new solvency ratio requirements. Parliament’s report also stresses the need for a European Treasury able to issue federal bonds at lower rates, as is the case in the United States. In the event of speculator activity, the ECB should be authorised to repurchase these eurobonds, like its counterparts in the US and the United Kingdom. Did you know that these two countries are generating funds at historically low rates, despite a rating downgrade for one of them? Ladies and gentlemen, we are not in the same situation as Germany in the 1920s – nowadays, production capacities are underused. Therefore, demand is not driving inflation. There is no cost inflation because we have wage moderation, or because the gloomy economy is keeping commodities costs low despite speculatory activity. We need to acknowledge that the time has come for bold monetary policies, given the current failure to recognise that budgetary orthodoxy is absurd in times of recession. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 The agreement of 27 October is flabbergasting. The austerity policies that it intends to include in the constitutions will plunge Europe into a recession where tax revenues will dry up and deficits will widen. They will increase the risks associated with holding sovereign debts, leading to higher interest rates. The banks will see their balance sheets deteriorate and will struggle to increase their capital. Only the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) would allow for a restructuring of debts and recapitalisations and defuse any new tension about rates. To do so, it would have to turn into the embryonic European Treasury, issuing Eurobonds which the European Central Bank (ECB) could buy back at a lower rate. There are no plans for this. The fund, which started off with EUR 440 billion, now only has EUR 250 billion. To raise the EUR 1 trillion supposed to reassure the markets, it will transform the sovereign debts held into derivatives to activate the ‘leverage effect’. However, the recession will increase the risk of defaults. We hardly dare imagine the effects of this securitisation of Italian and Spanish debts should these countries partly default. This agreement is explosive for the financial system, already under threat from austerity measures which are crippling growth. Turning to China rather than the ECB is detrimental to industry and employment in Europe. Liem Hoang Ngoc,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there will be no political Europe without a fiscal Europe. Unfortunately, the two issues that we are debating today demonstrate the Commission’s lack of ambition on that subject. As regards the system of taxation for parent companies with subsidiaries in other Member States, under the current directive, these groups are undertaxed, which is detrimental to public finances in the Member States. It has been a boon for transnational groups. In order to remedy this, I proposed in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that a parent company should only be exempt from paying tax on profits generated by subsidiaries on two conditions. Firstly, the parent company must hold the statutory minimum of 15% of company equity in another Member State for an uninterrupted period of at least two years in order to benefit from this tax regime. Sadly, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not accept that minimum period. Secondly, the profits distributed by a subsidiary to the parent company used to be taxed at a rate of 75% or more of the average tax rate in the EU Member States. I am pleased to say that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did agree to maintain the threshold of 70% of the average tax rate. The European Commission chose not to comment during our discussions, which was a pity. Consequently, Commissioner, we are left hoping that you will act on the message that we are sending, since Parliament is still not a colegislator on tax matters. The second symptom of your lack of concern about taxation is your failure to act when the Council quashed the directive on taxation of savings income. The ensuing vacuum has resulted in pick-and-mix bilateral agreements on the exchange of banking information, such as those concluded by the United Kingdom and Germany with Switzerland. Yet the Savings Tax Directive paved the way for automatic exchanges of information with several different tax havens, including Switzerland. The directive was the subject of a report that was adopted by a resounding majority in plenary. Although Mr Barnier has explained that there is no more money available to promote growth, applying the directive would allow us to generate EUR 200 billion for the public purse. A fiscal tool is essential if we are to recover from the crisis. Harmonised taxation is vital for an effective single market. Combating fraud and tax avoidance is crucial if we are to rebalance public accounts. For all these reasons, Commissioner, I can only urge you to do all you can to promote a fiscal Europe, in order to put an end to the Member States’ self-destructive rivalry. The main casualties of that rivalry are growth, public finances and solidarity among European citizens. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our fellow citizens are questioning the merits of austerity policies that are reducing their public services and squeezing their social security. Wherever these policies are rife, they are not succeeding in reducing public debt and bringing down unemployment. The contents of this ‘governance’ package – and I call them ‘contents’ deliberately – that we are discussing today are so ridiculous that even the economists are stunned, because they will prevent budgetary policy from adjusting to economic cycles. During the trialogue, the Commission representatives admitted to us themselves that they have not used any theoretical or econometric model as a basis for making sound predictions and recommendations. They admit that they are working on a purely intuitive basis. In the light of this, it is difficult to understand why the conservative, liberal and eurosceptic Members of this House have blindly attempted to toughen up the text proposed by the Commission. They are even less in a position to preach to us, considering that the governments led by friends of theirs have created these deficits through tax reductions that are as unfair as they are ineffective: is that not right, Mr Gauzès? They make grand statements about the Europe 2020 strategy, but they refuse to allow spending to prepare for the future, such as spending on investment, to be excluded from the calculation of the deficits. Yes, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, that is the crux of the debate as far as we are concerned! Let us reduce the deficits, yes, for example by going back on the tax gifts that have benefited the State’s creditors above all, but let us do it without sacrificing investment, training and jobs, because today’s investments are tomorrow’s jobs and the tax income that will follow, and this will allow us to reduce our deficits. This is the theorem that should appear on the frontispiece of the ‘governance’ package. My fellow conservative and liberal Members, some of you want to punish automatically States that are heretics to your dogma to the tune of billions of euros. They also want to punish countries that will not lower wages in order to regain their external balance. They believe that the deficits are primarily the product of bad intentions on the part of those States, as though the neoliberal model that you never question had not just been through its worst crisis since 1929, and as if it were not already leading to pressure on the buying power of ordinary people and causing a massive contraction in tax income: two problems that were at the root of the rise in private and public indebtedness in the first place. When it comes to the votes, socialists and democrats will send out a clear signal against this austerity package, which can only heighten the indignation that is rising throughout Europe. This clear signal is aimed at all workers in Europe and especially at our fellow citizens in France and Germany as they approach elections that will have a decisive impact on Europe’s future.

 Given the importance of this issue and the strict time constraints to which Parliament has had to work, we can all be pleased with what we have accomplished. In general, I agree with the priorities identified by the various reports, particularly the recognition of professional qualifications, the portability of pension rights, the rationalisation of procurement procedures, initiatives for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and access for all to certain basic banking services Certainly, in my opinion, other measures deserved to be highlighted, such as the issue of collective resources, but I am well aware that it was difficult to decide between these 50 proposals. I am also pleased that we were able to reach a compromise on the social clause, which states that any legislation on the Single Market should be subject to a social impact assessment and, if justified by the findings, should contain a reference to political and social rights. Finally, another reason for us to be satisfied is the fact that Parliament calls for guaranteed access, quality and affordability of services of general economic interest (SGEIs) and social services of general interest (SSGIs), and invites the Commission to take sectoral legislative initiatives in this area.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, 24 March, will be a symbolic day. In the first instance, it will be marked by the amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon that we have just voted for, which will allow a permanent European Stability Mechanism to be established. This mechanism allows the European Union to devise the first Eurobonds, which are designed to finance sovereign debt at low interest rates in the event of speculative attacks. In this respect, it is a shame that the process stopped halfway. To deal with the markets’ irrational exuberance, the revision of the Treaty ought to have been an opportunity to authorise the European Central Bank to do what the United States does and buy back public debt in the event of exchange rate tensions. The process is even more incomplete since the pay-off required is to implement the Competitiveness Pact, re-christened the Pact for the euro. This is the second symbol of tomorrow. This pact is backed unanimously by the Council, the Commission and the European Central Bank. Ladies and gentlemen, you all know the Washington Consensus: you loved it. Well, 24 March sees the birth of the ‘Brussels consensus’. The ‘Brussels consensus’ is the blind, roughshod application of neoliberal dogma: squeezing public services and the welfare state; wage austerity and minimal regulation of the financial markets. Ladies and gentlemen, the Council, the Commission and the ECB have short memories. They are proposing to transpose the Pact for the euro into the governance package so as to enshrine in our system the very policies that led to the economic crisis. In Spain, the UK, Ireland and elsewhere, the rise of household debt, which is fed by the finance industry, has been caused by none other than the crisis in buying power resulting from the pay restraint that has held sway for 20 years. The Pact for the euro unfortunately proposes to make wage austerity a permanent fixture. As for public debt, as well as being a consequence of the economic crisis, it is also a result of pointless tax reductions everywhere, advocated by liberals and conservatives. There was no explosion of public expenditure in Europe: quite the contrary. Budget and wage austerity, combined with the interest rate rises already planned by the European Central Bank, will end up killing off internal demand in Europe and killing off the recovery without reducing deficits. Tomorrow, we will be side by side with employees demonstrating against this ‘Brussels consensus’: this is the third symbol of 24 March. If we do not want to see a return of the likes of the brown shirts, whom Europe was created to stand against, the people’s elected representatives must stand with the people to denounce policies that are as unjust as they are ineffective.

 I am anxious to thank Mr Schwab and the shadow rapporteurs for their work. The Commission’s initial proposal was unacceptable because it intended to harmonise fully the rules concerning consumer rights, without systematically bringing them into line with the most favourable national legislation. In other words, many Member States would have had to remove from their national legislation provisions that in fact granted better protection to consumers. In France, two major acquis
 would have to be abandoned as a result: the ‘latent defect’ rule and the ruling that a doorstep seller is prohibited from collecting payment before the end of the cooling-off period. However my socialist colleagues and I succeeded in getting this approach altered and in making minimum harmonisation the norm. We also managed to enhance consumer rights on a whole range of points, in particular concerning information that has to be provided by the seller and provisions pertaining to the cooling-off period. One problem remains however: chapter V. We cannot accept that the rules on unfair terms be fully harmonised, because that would deprive Member States of their ability to react when faced with commercial practices that change daily and sometimes involve serious risks for consumers.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are debating today offers genuine advances. I am thinking, in particular, of Eurobonds, which the Union will need in order to finance the Europe 2020 strategy. Unfortunately, the right rejected in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs the principle of a tax on financial transactions at European level, despite having voted in favour of it in June. Its arguments for rejecting a European tax on financial transactions as a prelude to a global tax are the same as those put forward by the supporters of tax havens. It tells us that implementing a tax at European level alone would be disastrous for our financial sector. It also says that there would be a flight of capital from Europe. My answer to that is: so what if there is? The current volume of financial transactions is excessive compared to the needs of the real economy. Implementing this tax solely in Europe would help deflate the bubble. Furthermore, if the volume of speculative capital transactions, such as the credit derivatives at the origin of the crisis, were somewhat reduced, it would really help to consolidate the balance sheets of our banks. They would have a much greater incentive to finance the real economy. I would point out to those who are using the absence of an impact assessment for cover that no impact assessment was performed before the green light was given for a proliferation of derivatives. It is time, ladies and gentlemen, for all MEPs to face up to their responsibilities. The European Union must not continue to tag along behind a G20 dominated by the United States and China. It must lead the way in reforming our financial system. That is why I cannot support a text which chooses to overlook a tax on financial transactions. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 I would like to thank Mrs Weiler for this high quality report and the outcome of the negotiations with the Council, as the first reading agreement includes all the key elements that were put forward by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and which were approved in the vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. I am especially pleased to see that private companies and public authorities are now placed on an equal footing. The Commission’s initial proposal contained far more stringent penalties for public authorities, a position which our group felt was unacceptable as, unlike private undertakings, public sector bodies are not focused primarily on profit but rather operate in the general interest. The fact that the lender is entitled to compensation for recovery expenses also represents real progress since, up to now, many companies, particularly SMEs, have chosen not to reclaim late-payment interest from borrowers for the simple reason that the cost of the relevant procedures outweighed any financial gains. Finally, the maximum payment period of 30 days set out in the text seems reasonable, given that there is some scope for flexibility, notably for public healthcare bodies, a point that our group deemed particularly important.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, the ECOFIN Council approved the principle of the European Semester. As a federalist, I can only welcome such progress. However, coordinating budgetary policy is one thing; defining their content is another. That is why strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact is a serious mistake. The austerity treatment dogmatically imposed on the whole of Europe is already making its initial effects felt. Spain and Ireland are experiencing ever more difficulties, and the Markit survey, published at the end of August, shows that this treatment is responsible for the stagnation in European growth and, before long, the stagnation in German growth. The series of repressive measures outlined on the agenda of the next informal ECOFIN meeting is even more serious. Imposing automatic financial sanctions on States that are already facing budget problems is irresponsible. It will inevitably fuel the criticisms in all the Member States with regard to their national contributions to the EU budget. Two and a half million citizens expressed the first opposition to the austerity package on the streets of France yesterday. Instead of preserving social safety nets and establishing the social harmony in the EU that is necessary for the recovery, the Council and the Commission are destroying them. Do they measure the impact of such decisions only by the increasing level of Euroscepticism among citizens? For the sake of European integration and of the citizens for whom it is being undertaken, it must be acknowledged, ladies and gentlemen, that strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact is an economic aberration. It is also a serious political mistake. Liem Hoang Ngoc,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the own-initiative report on which we are voting this week is of particular symbolic importance at a time when the markets are unable to assess the risks associated with the economic situation in the euro area. Having demanded severe budget adjustment policies, they now doubt the capacity of Member Sates to kick-start their growth and, hence, to obtain the tax revenue necessary to pay the interest on their debt. Unfortunately, no risk assessment can be carried out in the deeply uncertain context in which the global economy now finds itself. Such an assessment is all the more important in the European Union, where the production capacity utilisation rate is at an all-time low. Instead of investing, companies are mothballing machines because, despite the initial signs of recovery at the end of 2009, demand is lacking. Growth would even end up going into reverse if restrictive measures were to nip the recovery in the bud. The first aim of our report was precisely to determine the optimum time for launching policies for emerging from the crisis. We proposed maintaining the support measures until the normal production capacity utilisation rate was restored. We therefore suggested ratifying the principle of anti-cyclical budgetary policies, which were successfully established during the first phase of the crisis in 2008 and 2009, and which are in line with the spirit of the reform of the 2005 Stability Pact. These policies entail using automatic stabilisers, in other words, in earmarking surpluses from the primary budget for debt repayment at the top of the cycle, and in allowing Member States to borrow the resources necessary for stimulus packages at the bottom of the cycle. We are currently at the bottom of the cycle. Interest rates are definitely under pressure and are threatening the sustainability of the debt. This being the case, the European Central Bank was right to announce that it would buy back some debt to enable Member States to diversify their sources of finance. Nevertheless, in addition to the fact that this concept of sustainability has never been defined in the economic literature, can the risk premiums demanded by the markets be deemed justifiable? No, if we consider that risk in the mortgage derivatives market, just as in the public-debt market, is impossible to assess. This is why, in our report, we proposed that particular attention be paid to the structural deficit indicator rather than the focus being … (The President cut off the speaker)
 This is why, in our report, we proposed that particular attention be paid to the structural deficit indicator rather than the focus being on the current account deficit, the scale of which is due to the deterioration in the actual budget deficit. This is the result of the crisis, which has weakened growth and concomitant tax revenue. This revenue has also been adversely affected by the lowering of taxes, which did not have the expected impact on supply. Our report seeks to offer three recommendations combined with some operational indicators. The first is to maintain support measures until the recovery has been consolidated. The second is to monitor the structural deficits, which are still close to equilibrium, despite the deterioration in actual budget deficits, in order to send a reassuring signal to the markets as to the state of public finances. The third is to assess the efficiency of tax expenditure and, in particular, of certain tax reductions which are related to the fall in tax revenue. Unfortunately, for the liberals and the conservatives in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, common sense counts for little; the impact of the crisis counts for little; and the fact that the massive debt is also due to the bank bail-out plans counts for little. Only their blind faith in the efficiency of the financial markets counts; only dogmatic compliance with a manifestly out-of-date Stability Pact counts. They do not see any need to create the tools required for economic governance, which is essential in order to strengthen the Union. It is a case of putting Europe on a starvation diet and doggedly trying to meet the criteria in the pact without any guarantee of success and at the risk of destroying the recovery, and too bad for social cohesion. That is the position that they have defended in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Since that vote, the economic health of Europe has deteriorated further. The European Central Bank and the Commission have finally come up with monetary and budgetary instruments which should enable us to improve economic governance in the euro area. However, the markets have fallen once again, unsettled as they are by the austerity plans. The Ecofin Council had to start all over again on Monday. Against this background, the amendments which we are tabling are, all in all, very moderate; and we are tabling some new ones too. They argue for flexible implementation of the Stability Pact, so that an unwelcome austerity cure can be avoided. They advocate a public credit rating agency to shield Member States from the diktat of the markets. These are the signals that Parliament must send out. Mr Karas, the time for ideological knee-jerk reactions has passed, as has the time for short-term national electoral moves. Europe needs policies which are motivated by a real desire to strengthen the Union. If you and your group are not up to this task, if you are no longer capable of representing the general interest, you can be sure that our citizens will be able to draw their own conclusions, for the future of the euro area is now at stake.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, two taboos have been broken in recent weeks. Firstly, the ECB can now monetise sovereign debts. Secondly, EU expenditure can now be financed by borrowing and, in particular, when the stabilisation and support funds are created. There is a third taboo, which unfortunately has not been broken, and it is the Stability and Growth Pact, which some Members of this House are dogmatically demanding be strengthened. Commissioners, we socialists are in favour of federalism. We are in favour of the coordination of budget policies. However, if the coordination of budget policies means overriding national parliaments so as to put their citizens on a starvation diet, then I fear that that might be a fine EU idea which will itself end up starving to death. This is the real threat which we are all facing at the moment. Commissioners, the austerity plans in Greece, Spain, Portugal and France do not have any chance of succeeding. I ask you to acknowledge this. Liem Hoang Ngoc,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Giegold’s report is particularly significant given the current macro-economic debate. This report is all the more relevant given the fact that its author is a German MEP who wanted to draw the attention of Europeans to the distorted effects, for the countries of the euro area, of the German strategy of reducing labour costs in the single currency system. The German Government is, in fact, about to drag the euro area and the whole of the European Union into generalised wage deflation with damaging macro-economic consequences. Particularly in the absence of consistent structural funds and sufficient budgetary resources, and faced with the impossibility of devaluation, Member States with current accounts in deficit are condemned, in order to resist, to trim their wages and reduce the perimeter of their social security systems. The result is firstly a slowdown in internal demand which, since the second quarter of 2008, has led to negative growth, and this was even before the start of the liquidity crisis. Secondly, we are seeing a rise in the personal debt of households with modest incomes and means, whose purchasing power is no longer increasing. Their debt to acquire homes was fed by the whole deregulated financial machinery, in Spain, in the United Kingdom and in Ireland, with the disastrous consequences we have observed in the subprime crisis. Ladies and gentlemen, listening to the debates in committee, a significant number of MEPs would seem to be forgetting the lessons of this crisis. This crisis is far from behind us. The current recovery is all the more fragile given the fact that Europe is continuing with wage deflation and the Commission, but also the President of the Eurogroup and the President of the European Central Bank – whom we heard on Monday – are calling on the Member States to prematurely adopt exit policies that are comparable to real austerity plans. These policies risk nipping growth in the bud when it has barely become positive again, even though capacity utilisation rates remain low. These policies will fail to reduce the deficits in Greece, in Spain and elsewhere, because the expected tax revenue will fail to materialise also. They will exacerbate unemployment and will fuel social tensions. The Giegold report has the merit of drawing attention to some of these macro-economic imbalances. Unfortunately, the final version, amended by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, refuses to condemn wage deflation. However, on the whole, the debate opened by Mr Giegold may be beneficial at a time when neoliberal dogma thrown into doubt by the crisis is back in force in Parliament, in the Council and in the Commission.

As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I am delighted that the vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has made it possible to integrate into the final report a number of ideas that we wanted to see emerge. The first is the need to adopt a more qualitative approach in respect of the implementation of the Internal Market Scoreboard, enabling the causes of the transposition deficit to be identified. We do not underestimate the usefulness of the statistical data and the pressure that comes from promoting the EU’s good and bad students, but in our opinion, the Commission ought to be more ambitious and try to make this scoreboard a tool designed to appreciate the difficulties encountered by the Member States within the context of the transposition process. All the more so since we all know that the transposition deficit may sometimes be due not to ill will by the Member States, but to the mediocre quality of the European legislation to be transposed. The second aspect I focused on is the need to strengthen dialogue between the Commission and the Member States throughout the transposition period. The more the information exchanges take place upstream, the more it will be possible to prevent the risk of non­transposition or incorrect transposition. The report does, however, pose a problem on one point: this relates to paragraph 10, which did not initially appear in Mrs Thun Und Hohenstein’s draft report. This paragraph proposes the creation of an internal market test for all new proposed legislation. We are strongly opposed to this since such a test seems to us to be pointless at best and dangerous at worst. Indeed, the review of any barriers to the internal market already takes place during the impact studies carried out by the European Commission with each new legislative proposal. We would not like this internal market test to be used as a pretext for undermining social or environmental advances. We could not agree to it in those circumstances. Liem Hoang Ngoc,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this period of crisis, public finances have been heavily used, initially to save the financial system and then to cushion the social and economic impact. In this context, there is much talk of public deficits, the spending of Member States is being attacked, but the fall in tax receipts is allowed to fade into the background. One forgets that, each year in the European Union, EUR 200 billion evades taxation, and these are resources which could have been used for essential recovery policies, resources which would allow us calmly to face up to what some are calling, in inverted commas, the demographic time bomb. This is why the texts that we are discussing today are so important. The introduction of common tools and absolute transparency between the Member States in the area of debt recovery are vital steps if we are to ensure that no citizen, no company, can evade their fiscal responsibility, and that everyone contributes to the collective effort. We must give the tax authorities of each country in the Union the resources to fulfil their missions. We must also emphasise the extent to which a healthy fiscal policy is essential. Everyone is currently concerned about Greece. We are seeing today the extremes to which the lack of an effective fiscal apparatus leads. It is not merely the crisis that is harming the Karamanlis government; it is, above all, its predecessor’s lack of political courage in failing to reform Greece’s fiscal administration and thus to create an effective tax recovery tool. We hope, in this matter, that the Union will use all of the resources at its disposal to confirm its solidarity with Greece. I hope that the vote we take on Wednesday confirms the vote in committee and results in some encouraging tax recovery texts. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

Mr President, to my mind, the Commission’s proposed Agenda for Change raises many questions, chief amongst them the matter of how exactly the principle of differentiation is to be applied. The Commission’s wish is that, from 2014, the countries receiving EU development aid should be chosen purely on the basis of the criterion of per capita wealth. As Baroness Ashton has said, this is not just a matter of money; it merits a proper policy debate on how we define our priorities for international cooperation. And I do not think this differentiated approach is consistent with the spirit of the Cotonou Agreement. I firmly believe that those ACP countries that have recorded good economic performances should be encouraged in their transition towards more sustainable growth; they should not be improperly penalised for having managed to secure growth through discipline, good governance and prudent economic policy.

Mr President, all of us are well aware of how tedious and time-consuming negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) can be. My feeling is that this has indeed been the case with this issue. On the one hand, it is not hard to see that only 18 of the 36 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries which have embarked on or signed an EPA have ratified it. The remainder are therefore encouraged to conclude and implement an agreement quickly, if they do not want to see their negotiation efforts ruined by, for example, the deadline of 2014. On the other hand, we have all known, since 2007, that this regulation was merely temporary, being incompatible with the rules of the World Trade Organisation. These facts therefore lead me to believe that our rapporteur’s proposal is the best possible compromise if we want to give the Commission services and the ACP countries the time they need to conclude their EPA negotiations. Nevertheless, if the date 1 January 2016 does not win a majority in tomorrow’s vote, I would call on my fellow MEPs to reject the Commission’s proposal. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank our two rapporteurs for the work they have done on this issue. It was necessary because we started from a very low base with the Commission’s basic proposal: no specific mention of the outermost regions, which are directly affected by competition from Latin American countries; no automatic activation of the stabilisation mechanism; no possibility for Parliament to ask for a safeguard investigation to be initiated; non-compliance of social and environmental standards as possibly constituting an unfair competitive advantage. That is why it is extremely important that tomorrow’s vote validates the progress made on these points in the Committee on International Trade (INTA). Nonetheless, it is not sufficient, because we know that the activation thresholds for both these regulations are so high that they render these mechanisms practically inoperable. Furthermore, the Commission must provide for an additional financial envelope to support EU banana production. We must bear in mind that numerous jobs are at stake in these European regions, which already have record unemployment rates. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, faced with the profound changes which our world is experiencing today, the European Union is duty bound to reform its generalised system of preferences. Like all compromises, this is no exception. Although it is satisfactory from a strictly commercial point of view, it is far from perfect, because we must bear in mind that this regulation is aimed at developing countries. By developing its new paradigm of differentiation, the Commission says that it wants to refocus its activities to help the poorest countries. At first sight, this seems to be completely acceptable to us. However, in order to achieve this, the Commission has developed a strictly accounting approach that is based upon the sole criterion of GDP per capita. We can clearly see the limits of this approach. What about the numerous middle income developing countries whose economies are not very diversified and which are vulnerable to climatic uncertainties? The compromise found with the Council does not resolve this issue and that is why I call upon my colleagues to vote in favour of the three amendments that will be tabled on this text.

 I welcome the position adopted by Parliament today. I would like to address two key points in this report. It was important that Parliament spoke out strongly against the Commission’s proposal to reduce the specific allocation for outermost regions (ORs) by almost half. This cut in funding is all the more unfair in that it affects the money set aside to compensate for the disadvantages of these regions which, by definition, are not decreasing. They are described as structural and permanent in our Treaties. Consequently, these regions would be the only territories, and I mean the only ones, under the cohesion policy that would see a cut in their funds, which would not be justified by growth effects or a change in category of regions. Secondly, I would like to focus on our call for a comparative analysis of pricing in these regions. Economic mechanisms that go against the principles of the single market seem to be at work here and often lead to extremely worrying social movements. In this area, we need to have better informed and targeted action to meet this urgent demand of the people. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, this initiative comes from a good place. Work on education and training must be a priority when it is not only essential for the employability of our young people but also an investment for the future, a gauge of our ability to maintain dynamic and sustainable development. That being said, I am still extremely dubious about how consistent European action is overall. If the EU is not capable of implementing real solutions for growth, if it is still obsessed with punitive austerity, sterile austerity, austerity for austerity’s sake, there will be no growth for small and medium-sized enterprises, no jobs for young people and all of our efforts will be in vain. Similarly, if the fight against youth unemployment is our priority, how do you explain your proposal to reduce certain funds dedicated to the outermost regions by almost 50%, Commissioner? These regions where youth unemployment is at over 60%, these regions which you promised to protect, find themselves being sanctioned more than any others. Where is the consistency? Where is the justice? This decision is unacceptable and we are against. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

 This DCI/BAM text brushes aside the mandate that was given to Parliament’s negotiating team, which was to observe the spirit and the letter of the Treaty of Lisbon, to place Parliament on an equal footing with the Council in all programming decisions relating to the choice of strategic priorities and financial allocations, and not to set a negative precedent for Parliament prior to the forthcoming negotiations on the future external aid financing instruments 2014-2020. By applying Article 291 TFEU on strategic programming decisions, Parliament’s power of scrutiny will be more limited than it was with the comitology procedure under the old Treaty. All this is a result of the shameful blackmail by the Council, which was threatening to block the entire package of measures if Parliament rejected any one of the four texts that were voted on. I therefore voted against this text, because our Parliament had a duty to defend its rights as set out in the Treaty of Lisbon, whilst demonstrating that its plenary remained sovereign in the face of the Council’s efforts at destabilisation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our coordinator Thijs Berman could not be with us in the end this evening for personal reasons. However, I know that he shares my views on this issue fully. The conciliation on this legislative package was tedious and time-consuming and, while the outcome on the human rights instrument and the enlarged Industrialised Countries Instrument (ICI Plus) is satisfactory, we still have a very long way to go with regard to the Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM). The compromise reached on this text thus brushes aside the mandate that was given to our negotiating team, which was to place Parliament on an equal footing with the Council in all of the programming decisions relating to the choice of strategic priorities and financial allocations. I say this because it is indeed Parliament’s powers and the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon itself that are we are talking about here. The choice of programming priorities is a highly political decision, in which our Parliament must have its say. By categorically refusing to grant Parliament any such power of oversight and by employing shameful blackmailing tactics, the Council has, once again, made a reprehensible ideological withdrawal. Member States must, however, understand that the European Union’s external actions are now a responsibility that is shared between our institutions. That is why Parliament must retain its authority and reject the proposal on the BAM. This is the only means we have of showing the Council and the Commission that Parliament wishes to see greater transparency in Community decisions. If we lose this battle, it could lead to an absurd situation in which we would have to wait for a new Treaty in order to obtain, at long last, the powers that are in fact already conferred on us by the Treaty of Lisbon.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to highlight Parliament’s support for the creation of a category of intermediate regions and I would point out that this will in no way – contrary to what some have said – be an additional burden on the Community budget. What we are proposing here is a revolution in the concept of transition with an unchanged budget. Our desire is to move towards a fairer system which helps those regions that have substantial difficulties. This transitional zone between 75 and 90% of European GDP is a real commitment towards a consolidated cohesion policy for the years to come. Furthermore, I am delighted that our resolution has confirmed Parliament’s commitment towards the outermost regions. The latter are subject to specific and permanent disadvantages which justify this solidarity effort, in order for them to effectively be the Union’s interface with the world. Patrice Tirolien,

 Madam President, the position unanimously adopted today by our Parliament shows just how vitally important the issue of implementing powers is to this House. Nevertheless, to turn to the subject of the Banana Accompanying Measures, this agreement is embarrassing with regard to our ACP banana-producing partners. Indeed, one year after these countries legitimately obtained compensation from the Commission, they have still not received the funds, even though the Geneva Agreement is hitting them hard. Therefore, they are the ones I am addressing again today when I say that it is precisely because we want to relay our demands even further that this House must have its say in the EU’s strategy and general guidelines for external aid. We are determined not to fall into the trap set by the Commission and the Council. Transparency of European decisions must be at the heart of our work. This is the very spirit of the Treaty and the essence of history. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing. 
– (FR)
 It is impossible to separate the Geneva Agreement from the other agreements that the Commission has subsequently negotiated. Shortly after the Geneva Agreement was signed, Colombia and Peru obtained a greater tariff reduction, thus proving that the agreement provides no legal certainty and has not settled the banana dispute as it claims. This differential treatment prompted Ecuador and Guatemala to demand equal treatment and threaten to lodge further appeals at the WTO. Furthermore, this agreement seriously harms a sector that provides countless jobs not only in our ACP partner countries but also in the outermost regions (ORs). The aid the EU is providing to support producers in the ORs has been calculated on the basis of the laws approved at the WTO in 2006. However, neither the December 2009 agreement nor the agreement with the Andean countries was anticipated in the POSEI. As for the aid earmarked for ACP producers, it is not sufficient to enable them to adapt to the new tariff situation. To give one’s assent to this agreement is to support the Commission in a strategy that is inconsistent with the EU’s effort in favour of the ORs and the ACP countries. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to focus my speech on Mr Goerens’ report, which deals with the ACP Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM). As I myself come from one of the only European regions to produce bananas, I can only show solidarity with the ACP producers in question. Solidarity, first and foremost, because a strong historical link unites the European Union to these countries, and we should do our utmost to ensure that they, too, are able to maximise the benefits of globalisation, of which they are, more often than not, the first victims. Solidarity, also, because the trade concessions generously granted by the Commission to the WTO are in danger of dealing a fatal blow to this agricultural sector in our ACP partner countries. Solidarity, but definitely not naivety, lastly, since the proposal for a BAM regulation as tabled by the Commission put much too much emphasis on the economic diversification aspect. Given the loss of tariff preference that resulted from the WTO agreement, this programme’s main goal is clearly to ensure the sustainability of ACP banana exports and hence, to help make them competitive. Furthermore, let us be honest, the funds set aside by the BAM are by no means enough and do not extend over a long enough period to make diversification happen. Finally, I would add that, if we are aware of the urgency of the situation, we can accept these accompanying measures being financed through the extensive redeployment of heading IV of the budget. The Council must be responsible and work towards finding a viable solution for the multiannual financing of this programme. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome this debate today. It once again shows the need for the Union to appreciate and make the most of its regional diversity. At this time when we are negotiating the new 2014-2020 framework programmes, I think it important to emphasise the amendments from which specific regions must benefit. Issues of continuity and territorial cohesion must be at the heart of our concerns. The development of mountain regions, islands and sparsely populated areas, however, requires more than just a set of derogations. We must adopt a horizontal approach. We must put in place instruments capable of making Union action in all areas coexist in synergy, thereby increasing their added value. Moreover, as a representative of an outlying region, I look forward to the new Union strategy on the outermost regions, which the Commission services have promised for early 2011.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when this text came before the Committee on Regional Development, I managed to introduce the idea of an extension of the exemption authorising the production of reconstituted milk in Martinique and Guadeloupe, following the example of the sustainable growth model which proved its worth in Madeira. Unfortunately, there was no consensus on this position at the last trialogue. This is regrettable for two reasons. Firstly, in terms of substance, dairy production in the French overseas departments would offer multiple unmissable opportunities: the strengthening of the cattle industry, self-sufficiency in a basic foodstuff and the creation of jobs. Secondly, in terms of content, our Parliament as a whole was unable to reach a decision on my proposal since it wanted to pass this text at first reading via an informal procedure that I oppose. Be that as it may, our work on this POSEI regulation will continue very soon during the mid-term review of this regulation. At that point, I will again request an exemption in the other French overseas departments. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

Mr President, is Haiti condemned to misfortune? Since its independence, natural disasters have given way to political catastrophes there, and here we are today faced with a tragedy of historic proportions. There are dead, injured, countless destroyed buildings and the ruin of national political structures and cooperation structures. We must beat fate. The European Union must participate in this twin emergency and reconstruction effort. We owe it to our numerous ties with Haiti, ties that are, first and foremost, historic: a former colony, Haiti was the most prosperous of them all; secondly, diplomatic: the Cotonou Agreement makes the island a privileged partner; and, finally, geographical, since Haiti is a neighbour of the European Union thanks to the outermost regions. Moreover, the crisis in Haiti represents the first test of the new European External Action Service, which you head up, Mrs Ashton. That has been conclusive up to now. This disaster also underlines the challenges and the improvements that we must make to this structure, since the solidarity movement of our continent aside, the US reaction raises questions about our mobilisation capacity. Thus, the remarkable efforts in favour of European coordination, the Member States’ contributions, must not conceal the difficulty of the discussions concerning the deployment of the European Gendarmerie Force. While it is crucial for the European Union’s expenditure to be guided by the United Nations, these difficulties lead to the conclusion that the European Union must equip itself with an autonomous, integrated structure with the means to deal with tasks as complex as a humanitarian emergency. Finally, the reconstruction phase represents an immense challenge. There is no shortage of tasks: political, administrative, economic, social and environmental. We are perhaps at year zero of a new era for Haiti. This is a major political challenge for a Europe that must assert itself as a visible leader in this process. Patrice Tirolien,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Guinea is currently being rocked by tragic events that have shocked the international public and flouted the law. Indeed, on 28 September 2009, the military junta led by Captain Dadis Camara carried out the bloody repression of a peaceful demonstration bringing together all of the opposition parties. Now, the Cotonou agreements base relations between the European Union and its ACP partners on respect for human rights and democratic principles. Therefore, Captain Dadis Camara’s unilateral decision to postpone the elections and to refuse to raise the issue of his candidacy for Guinean president is a serious failure to honour the commitments made to hold free and transparent elections within one year. The European Union must therefore take immediate action in line with the principles and the permanent values that underpin its action so that this violence, which represents so many human rights violations, stops. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the compromise resolution is fully in line with our values and principles, but I am particularly anxious to emphasise here Article 10 of this text, namely the suspension of the fisheries agreement protocol between the European Union and the Republic of Guinea until the democratic process has begun. I can hear people wondering whether such a decision would have disastrous socio-economic consequences for the population but, faced with the violence of 28 September, we must recognise that the Guinean Government is scarcely concerned about the living conditions of its citizens and that it leaves us with no other option than to be firm. Since its independence in 1958, Guinea has only ever known dictatorial regimes. Patrice Tirolien,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.
 – (FR) 
Mr President, the worrying developments concerning the political situation and security in Guinea require a firm response by the European Union. Indeed, as you know, on 28 September 2009, troops under the Guinean Government carried out the bloody repression of a peaceful demonstration uniting all of the opposition parties, causing 157 deaths and injuring more than a thousand people, some of whom suffered particularly vile instances of rape and mutilation. The Republic of Guinea is a country that has experienced only two dictatorial regimes since its independence in 1958. It is time for this infernal spiral to come to an end. The European Union, its Member States and its institutions had already condemned Moussa Dadis Camara’s coup d'état
 on 28 December 2008. As is procedure, the Council then applied Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement to establish a road map with the Guinean authorities, to be used as a framework for democratic transition. This list of measures included, in particular, the organisation of free and transparent elections within a year and the commitment that members of the CNDD, notably Moussa Dadis Camara, would not stand in these elections. Captain Camara’s decision to postpone the organisation of elections until spring 2010 and his refusal to raise the issue of whether he would stand for the Guinean Presidency were a sign of what was to come, with the current escalation. Thus, the demonstration that was bloodily repressed on 28 September was aimed precisely at calling on the junta to honour its commitments. The reaction of the government in office in Conakry shows its true intentions quite clearly: to eliminate all forms of democratic opposition in order to remain in power. In response, the international community has unanimously condemned these violent actions and the Guinean regime. Outraged by these massacres, our Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries recently refused, quite rightly, to vote for the Fisheries Agreement between the European Union and Guinea. Today, and in light of the latest events, the European Parliament would like to know the decisions the Council intends to take to address this situation. First of all, does the Council intend to push for the creation of an international commission of inquiry on the events of 28 September? How does the Council intend to act to ensure that the CNDD respects its commitments, namely to organise free and transparent elections as soon as possible, without the participation of Moussa Dadis Camara or another member of the CNDD? With regard to Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, what measures does the Council intend to take against the Guinean junta? Finally, what concrete commitments has the Council made to support the different initiatives run by ECOWAS, the African Union and the International Contact Group on Guinea? Pervenche Berès,

 Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs sees this end-of-year meeting as of major significance, since in order to achieve a genuine economic and monetary union we must revisit its foundations, which clearly did not withstand the crisis in which we find ourselves. The work done by this Parliament, under the responsibility of Ms Thyssen – whom we all thank for the excellent quality of the work – is meant to make clear, to define, Parliament’s position with a view to this major European Council meeting in December. I am therefore surprised by the absence of Herman Van Rompuy, its President, for whom this work is intended. In addition, I consider that the result of our vote here will give our sherpas a mandate to represent us in the negotiations in preparation for this work. We also consider that this meeting cannot be downplayed or underestimated in the light of the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework. Rewriting a genuine economic and monetary union must remain the priority. In this area, it is necessary to raise the social issue: we have been greatly struck by the fact that the document put on the table by Mr Van Rompuy in June defines four pillars, without ever mentioning the social dimension. Yet if you look at the Treaty of Maastricht, if you look at the current state of economic and monetary union, it is obvious that there is an imbalance between the economic policies defined in Article 121 and the employment policies defined in Article 148. However, if you rebuild economic and monetary union on the basis of Mr Van Rompuy’s proposals, without taking account of this original balance, you will destabilise the entire mechanism. Moreover, Parliament, our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, also sets great store by parliamentary control, democratic control, and therefore the chance for Parliament to participate, under the ordinary legislative procedure, in the Annual Growth Survey establishing the framework for this European Semester. A final point, Mr President, to highlight an element not mentioned often enough. If we want the troikas to succeed, they must be expanded to include the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which has today denounced the failure to abide by the ILO fundamental conventions in Greece, following the work of the troika. A genuine economic and monetary union cannot ignore the very foundations of the European social model. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, here are three debates one after the other in our order of business, in which you are at the heart of the discussion. You have led some of these debates with Commissioner Andor, which is right, as they discuss industrial policy, which is also at the heart of European jobs. However, a key figure is missing from your debate – that is, Commissioner Barnier – because it is evident that, behind several strategies that are at play, it is strategies for financing the economy that lead to the unravelling of the industrial fabric of our regions, and it is also the stitch you will need to knit, if you will permit the expression. I therefore thank you for having taken the initiative of this working group, which is a logical link between the reasoning on raw materials and that on the car industry. What is required is a global strategy that combines the issue of research and development with the issue of quality and jobs. I am always struck by the extent to which Europeans have been mobilised and shocked at the idea that they could no longer control access to rare earths as if it were a strategic issue, rather like what the Americans have sometimes done. Yet when considering the issue of iron and steel, Europeans do not consider it just as strategic for our economies. We allow Mr Mittal to behave simply like a financier and, contrary to everything we have learned in our economics textbooks, rather than create added value, he tries to go up the added value chain by destabilising and destroying production units on the European sites so he can go and buy mines, where he can organise speculation better. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament will, in adopting Mr Ferber’s report, draw important lessons from MiFID I by adopting a text that ensures that almost all financial transactions will have to take place on regulated venues. That is the meaning we must give this text. High-frequency trading, a technique allowing a large number of orders to be executed in a few milliseconds, will now be highly constrained. The crisis has brought to light the abusive practices linked to the use of high-frequency trading by some financial players, disrupting the functioning of financial markets to obtain considerable profits. The position adopted by Parliament is a move in the right direction by discouraging use of this practice; it will help to put finance back where it belongs, that is to say, serving the real economy and long-term investment. With this report, Parliament also wishes to tackle food speculation, which can be devastating for entire populations, by introducing position limits for the various players operating on trading venues. The destabilising effects of commodity speculation are increasingly clear, particularly on foodstuff markets. With this in mind, the proposals adopted today are a first step in the right direction, insofar as they impose limits on positions that may be taken by those operating on trading venues. This report also allows us to take a significant step forward: the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will be able to intervene to prohibit the sale of certain financial products acknowledged as toxic to the economy. In conclusion, I would like to talk about an important point linking the discussion on MiFID I and the text we are going to adopt here. When considering MiFID I, Parliament’s main contribution concerned, the issue of advice that investors, particularly small investors, must be given when undertaking an investment. Financing conditions for such advice remain a point of discussion on which we must provide clarity to ensure that everyone, irrespective of income, may access such advice on terms that are transparent and actually enable them to invest on an informed basis.

Mr President, I hesitate somewhat in giving Mr Eppink the opportunity to speak even more. All the same, I would like to give him the chance to correct what he said with regard to the latest International Monetary Fund observations, because, on reading carefully –
 as you clearly have not –
 what the IMF says about the European situation it is exactly the opposite of what you said. In fact, the IMF tells us that the policies currently being followed will lead to more austerity, something which, moreover, can be seen by any person who is intellectually honest –

Mr President, Commissioner De Gucht, could you tell Commissioners Rehn and Andor that this Parliament takes the European Semester procedure seriously? To that end, when, on 28 November, the Commission puts on the table the annual growth review, which will serve as our underlying thread for 2013, we would like them to have several messages in mind. Firstly, to take account of the Growth Pact called for by the Heads of State or Government, on 28 and 29 June; next, the lessons from what the International Monetary Fund tells us, namely that a roadmap based only on austerity clearly has no chance of getting the European Union moving again.  Lastly, we think that the purpose of having an annual growth review and a definition of a European vision worked out before the European Council is to gain the means not simply to condemn each Member State in relation to its budgetary policy but also to draw up a common roadmap, enabling us, for instance, to correct macroeconomic imbalances. Please tell your colleagues that we would like two important things. The first is the possibility for Parliament to be involved in defining this European roadmap. For that we need a document we are able to amend, even though, formally, we do not currently have powers of codecision. Then, if the Member States are required, alongside national reform programmes and stability and convergence programmes, to submit national programmes for jobs, these documents must then be taken seriously. Member States that do not take them seriously must be penalised or, at least, called on to do so with a vigilance not shown by Mr Rehn this year.

In particular, the country from which I come and which you undoubtedly do not know as well as I do, is one where the demographic situation is nothing like that seen in other European countries, which makes it possible, in a difficult climate in which the President of the French Republic is seeking to re-establish conditions for a fruitful social dialogue to conduct reform, to have a mandate based on a decision imposed in relation to the record of his predecessor.

Mr President, the keystone of the European Union, the dimension that was lauded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, is solidarity. However, there can be no solidarity without money, without a budget. We know today that over the past 14 years the national budgets have increased, on average, more rapidly than the European Union budget, and now the Member States want the EU budget to decrease more rapidly then theirs. Moreover, President Barroso wants the social model to be the spearhead of our competitiveness. The International Monetary Fund tells us that the austerity policy that we are implementing is counterproductive. Day after day, we ask the Member States to carry out structural reforms. The first of these involves investment in human capital. I do not like that expression but it is what it says. Our greatest asset is the quality of our men and women. In that regard, in the next budget, if we do not succeed in building a wall to consolidate social spending, allocating 25 % of cohesion policy funds to the European Social Fund, we will be on the wrong track and we will not be preparing the European Union to cope with the challenges that lie ahead. In the same spirit, we must defend the programme for the most deprived persons and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. Pervenche Berès,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

Mr President, I am going to speak on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the report by Ms Auconie on a proposal to support European Social Entrepreneurship Funds. Last week, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, in an excellent conference organised by Commissioner Andor, emphasised that the European social model was an element of EU competitiveness and that social entrepreneurship clearly formed part of this. The proposal we have on the table is therefore welcome. However, I think that we must ensure – and that was the subject matter of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL) – that, through these social entrepreneurship funds, we do not create new niches in financial markets. I have to say that, from this point of view, we have two concerns. We had asked in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that the issue of social housing be treated specifically, and I think that that would have been valuable. Finally, I have to say that the response from the Commissioner representing Commissioner Barnier on the establishment of such funds in tax havens is, in my view, problematic, as, once again, it is not a question of creating new niches or nouveaux riches but of fostering a new, highly promising sector, that of the social market economy, through social entrepreneurship.

Mr President, Mr Hökmark, have you read the Treaty on European Union? It does not talk about a market economy, but about a social market economy. Of all the Union’s values, you only mentioned values and democracy. However, the latter must be enshrined in its social dimension, in social protection, in social dialogue and in collective bargaining, which you clearly seem to be completely ignoring. When you talk about monopolies, are you also thinking about the private monopolies that can bring countries to their knees, such as Goldman Sachs in Greece? When you talk about the internal market, do you have an overall vision of the internal market, a vision of the internal market that we need, that is to say, an internal market that also comprises fiscal and social harmonisation? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, we already had the opportunity to address this issue in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on Monday evening. I would like to make several comments. The first is that, in these country-specific recommendations that you have just made, we basically believe that the fundamental question that should be settled, were all these recommendations to be implemented, is that of macro-economic imbalances within the Union. When you examine this jigsaw of recommendations, you wonder whether we really do have all the tools we need to correct these macro-economic imbalances, whether, in particular, we can make the management of the euro area as a whole as effective as we would like it to be. Then, when I look at the specific recommendations that you have made for France, a country with which I am well acquainted, I am struck by the fact that at no time did you say that these recommendations had been made on the basis of a document submitted to you by a government since defeated in the elections. In this document, you are acting on the results of five years of Presidency by Nicolas Sarkozy. You say that, over five years, France lost 19.4% of its external competitiveness. The French people’s response to that is to say that they would like VAT to be revised, the pension reform to be revised and the minimum wage boosted. However, you say precisely the opposite in the recommendations that you make to this country. That raises an issue of democracy. Mr Hughes has already said this in the name of my group, but I shall say it again in this particular instance. We shall not succeed collectively if, in the Member States, we feel that there is a diktat drawn up in Brussels which ignores the political realities of our countries. You must answer this question. In this Parliament, as you know, we are all in favour of integration, of greater strength together at a European level, because we know that only together shall we be able to recover. However, if you do this against the people, against their political choices, we shall go to the wall. You must answer this question, Commissioner. Pervenche Berès,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the European Parliament wanted to organise this debate based on the employment package that you have placed on the Commission’s table and which we feel it is important to talk about here today, in plenary, at a time when the European Council may well mention a growth initiative, alongside other weighty matters which will be on its work table. With regard to that growth initiative, we think that your voice – which says that this growth must create jobs – should be strong, hence the importance of this debate that we are organising today. When we look at the expectations of Europeans, at the time when the unemployment rate is approaching an historic record, it is not so much stabilising financial markets, but keeping or finding a job that concerns them more than anything. It is this expectation that we must respond to, especially when it comes to the youngest citizens. This hope bumps up against the realities of a social situation that is intensifying by the day. How, indeed, can we fail to foresee the spectre of a lost generation when we know that 5.6 million young people are unemployed, that one young European out of five is looking for work and that the situation may not improve before 2016, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The European Commission repeats that it will take some time before guidelines produce effects in terms of job creation. However, for this to happen, the guidelines must be the right ones. It is striking to see that in the national reform programmes that the Member States have sent to the Commission, ultimately, their commitment to present their national employment plans has not really been followed up with results. Many have not implemented this proposal. I would like to retain two proposals from this employment package that you have put on the table that we think are right at the heart of the discussion that we need to have. Firstly, the taboo that you have ended when it comes to the minimum wage. You said that the minimum wage is an important element in the debate for combating poverty and social exclusion, for combating social dumping, and for putting forward the question of aggregate demand, of stimulating internal demand. It is a major topic if we wish to solve the problems of internal imbalances within the European Union. Next, there is a second proposal that you seem to support, for which you know that Parliament will give you its backing, and that is this idea of a Youth Guarantee, which means that no young person would be without employment, education or training after four months in the labour market. This is a major proposal. If we want to commit to specific proposals that go beyond mere words, we must move forward on this in the coming months in terms of financial perspectives and the conclusions of the next European Council, and we will be by your side to do this. Thank you, Commissioner, for the process into which, together, we will be able to breathe life so that we may correct a strategy which, for too long, has been one of austerity and which is leading us towards disaster. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Ms Vestager, Mr Rehn, with these two reports, I think the important message that Parliament can bring to your work is that we must begin to improve consistency, since we can plainly see that the crisis we are sinking into, or have already sunk into, requires us to be perhaps a little more consistent. We cannot demand a lot from certain Member States and, at the same time, give nothing back, and we cannot wait until the end of the whole affair to reward them for their efforts. It is entirely a matter of governance – modern, intelligent governance adapted to the reality and severity of the crisis facing us. To achieve this consistency, when we draw up our economic policies, we must bear in mind everything we have learnt and everything we know about the extent of the macro-economic imbalances and the need to correct them. That means that the policies introduced must be evaluated, in terms of timing and criteria, according to how well they address these macro-economic imbalances. Secondly, Ms Vestager, the banking union question will clearly be at the heart of the discussions at the European Council on 28 and 29 June. The message I think this Parliament can give there, particularly with Ms Ferreira’s report, is one of balance. There must be a balance between a new approach in the Council debate to the challenges of growth, of which we are one of the main axes in Ms Ferreira’s report – which I hope will be given considerable support by this Chamber – and managing the debt issue. This balance between the way the debt question is addressed and the need for real growth – not merely internal market liberalisation but, above all, growth aiming at the long term and at investment – will at last enable us to give Europeans new hope. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Ms Vestager, Commissioner, when discussing a proposal on financial regulation, in a very classical way, two arguments are put forward. The first is that it is only possible to act on the largest possible scale, if possible on a global scale, and that any descent to a lower level would lead to a risk of unfair competition. The second argument is to say, ‘Oh, no, but certain products, which are safe, have to be excluded’. I would simply remind our fellow Members of the commitments made by the European Union, in particular through the members participating in the G20, who, in London, in April 2009, said, ‘We have decided that all financial institutions, markets and products of systemic importance should be subject to an appropriate level of regulation and supervision’. It seems to me that the taxation of financial transactions must also, under these conditions, cover undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and pension funds, that the level of intervention at which we will be able to launch this proposal will be the correct level of intervention, and that the issue of risks must be assessed on a global scale and not simply always to protect them.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs wanted to ask this question, and it did not know at the time that, on the very day on which we were to debate it, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) would bring out global youth unemployment figures, with 75 million young people unemployed and a red card for the European Union, within which 7.5 million young people between the ages of 15 and 24 are currently neither in a job nor in education or training. The European Union comes bottom of the class worldwide. Yet, when I look at the challenges facing the European Union, throughout the world, here and elsewhere, all day long, we say that Europe must meet the challenge of innovation, that it is innovation, that it is – a phrase I do not like – our human capital which will enable us to win the battle of globalisation. Yet, if that is the diagnosis we are making, how can we leave outside the labour market and exclude an entire generation? It is the whole question of the social impact of this crisis, which is not taken into account, which is neglected, which is regarded as a secondary issue. We are taking a collective risk, the consequences of which we are already seeing in a number of countries. The European Commission therefore set up eight Action Teams in eight of our Member States – Italy, Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Latvia, Spain, Lithuania and Slovakia – so that the European Union could mobilise its actions and its teams in these countries in order to meet this challenge in particular. Our questions to you, Commissioner, are therefore as follows. What are your conclusions? What proposals are you making? Where do you stand on this? We will support you whenever useful proposals are made to address this issue. However, we cannot accept the fact that youth unemployment rose from 14.7% in 2008 to 22.1% in 2011 and that, in many of our countries – as we know – almost half of young people are outside the labour market. We need what we have defined together as the goals of the EU 2020 strategy, which, it seems to me, has not aged a bit from that point of view, to be followed by actions. Yet, in this strategy – need I remind you – we said that we wanted early school leaving to be reduced to 10% of young people. We said that 40% of 30-34 year-olds would be required to have a qualifying diploma. What is happening in this regard? The proposals are on the table. I have taken note of the conclusions of the Council of 11 May 2012 with regard to strengthening the creative potential and innovation of young people. There is an urgent need for the EU to work towards this end. When the European Parliament, in particular, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, has examined the report by Jutta Steinruck on the EU programme for social change and innovation, it will submit proposals to you to enable us to finance a Youth Guarantee so that young people, when they leave the school system or when they lose their job, are no more than four months without work, without a training proposal or without an apprenticeship proposal. Those are the elements we want to discuss with you, Commissioner. We are convinced that this issue is a challenge for this generation of young people, the objective being to prevent them from becoming the excluded of tomorrow. However, it is also a challenge for our entire society, for the benefit of which we must take action. Commissioner, I know that, in this regard, we can count on your vigilance and the fact that you are a force for bringing forward proposals. This is a good opportunity to debate these elements and to make forward-looking proposals. (Applause) Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since, at this European Council, we ought to be talking openly and putting all our cards on the table, it seems to me that the state of the euro area means we should be thinking about things in three stages: the short term being the urgency of the situation in Greece, the medium term being a strategy for growth and the long term our vision of the euro area and us ‘living together’. In the short term, for Greece, we should realise that all those who thought that Greece could have a smooth exit from the euro area are being totally unrealistic; we have no Great Wall of China to protect us should Greece leave the euro area. Although we should also recognise that, in the Greek situation, nothing will be resolved if we continue to implement the troika’s mandate, which the Greeks rejected today. If we do not think things through, then nothing will be possible; there will be no general framework for an economic recovery, no hope restored, no dialogue and no solidarity at European level, be it in Greece or at European level. Commissioner, as you know, Mr Hollande’s election offers a rare window of opportunity to raise these issues again under new conditions. I do not agree with Mr Ferber when he said that there is only one model in Europe, the German model. We are a union built on diversity. Therefore, grab this window of opportunity that you have been given to finally provide Europe with all the answers it needs. These answers include a growth strategy, but not just any growth strategy. It should look beyond the internal market to avoid the traps of negative integration. These solutions should also include a genuine industrial policy, enabling us to make the investments we need to make our Europe a sustainable Europe, where jobs are created, where the main waste is not this generation currently being squeezed out of the labour market. You must admit then, Commissioner, that the way in which pressure is currently being put on Greece to reorganise its administration, while nothing is being done to help it with its negotiations with Switzerland, to put an end to the tax evasion performed by the privileged few in this country, is a source of injustice that neither the Greeks nor the Europeans, nor the French, nor the British nor the Germans should accept.

We have already said that we believe that the conditions under which sovereign debt is financed must be rethought.

 Mr Mitchell, I believe that the notion of showing respect for those who show solidarity is the basis on which we can all live together at European level. I also think that, in the case of your country, significant efforts have been made that have allowed you to recover from the difficult situation in which you found yourselves, but the contributions of a country like Ireland to what is the euro area is an issue which raises many other things that need to be put on the table. I should like to take this opportunity to say a few words about whether or not we should have taken note of the phenomena of rising prices and building bubbles over recent years. I see that, in your country, they managed to create a property bubble without stopping it in time. This is exactly the type of situation that we need to prevent. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I know the rules of this House. However, I would simply like to inform all of my colleagues about the vote that has just taken place. This item was added to the agenda on Monday and, clearly, most of my colleagues in the various groups did not know what they were voting on. That is why I abstained on most of the items in this resolution. I think that we have real difficulty here in terms of our working method. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 – (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Rehn, Commissioner, the fact that you are taking part with us in this debate on employment rights in a Europe of open borders implies, I imagine, that you have something to say on the subject in addition to your role of listening to the speeches. I must tell you, Commissioner, that you and I are very different, because whereas I am a lay person, to hear you speak, I sometimes get the impression that you belong to some sect or church that preaches austerity as its dogma. As a lay person, I rely on evidence. When I look at the current situation in Spain – a country that has conscientiously followed the Stability and Growth Pact and implemented all the Commission’s prescriptions, even when President Zapatero was in power – six million people are unemployed in the country today. Then I ask you, Commissioner: are the employment rights that we are talking about only valid during untroubled times, and in times of crisis must the Troika go to Greece to impose an austerity plan that totally ignores the strength of our social model and the important role of industrial relations in helping us come through the economic crisis? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Commissioner, my point is that at the time, Mr Sarkozy and Ms Merkel wanted to divide the socialists by using Mr Zapatero as an example against other socialist examples. Clearly, this is not the issue. The issue is whether or not healthy public finances can be restored in a country with no growth. The issue is not whether the problem is with the regions or with central government: the issue is growth for job creation. Commissioner, do you think this recipe will succeed in Greece when basically, from the workers’ point of view and that of the Greek people themselves, what you are proposing is for investment plans to be implemented by large German companies, and that Greeks should take advantage of their freedom of movement. That is tantamount to an organised brain drain. Do you really think that is the right way? Do you not think that, at the end of the day, there comes a time when one needs to admit that there has been a mistake? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
).  
– (FR)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, you said you were, on balance, in favour of the mutualisation of debt. You must tell us the steps you have taken in this regard and, more importantly, whether you think this mutualisation is useful and necessary or whether you are perhaps reacting to the new proposal made by Eurex which, in reality, destroys the European Union’s internal capital markets, allows speculation against a Member State and further diminishes the prospect of mutualising debt. In addition, Mr Barroso, I would like to know whether you have been informed by the outgoing French Government of the conditions for assessing France’s National Reform Programme and its Stability and Convergence Programme this year, given this country’s electoral timetable. Finally, with regard to the decisions taken this morning by your college relating to what is known as the ‘employment package’, I wonder about the consequences for your neighbour, Mr Rehn, with regard to the austerity policies being put forward in his portfolio. I already know what the response will be: ‘first austerity, then jobs’. I am led to believe this is not the solution and that what we are seeing today in Greece or Spain tells us that another way must be possible, one based on a pact for growth, responsibility and governance. Therefore, Mr Barroso, can you assure us that you are combining your two pillars, your employment pillar and your economic pillar, in the service of European citizens and job creation?

 Mr President, as Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I and Mr De Castro, who chairs the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, wished to raise this topic again here in plenary, partly in the light of the initial declarations made on behalf of the whole College of Commissioners on 15 February, in which it was stated that the Commission intended to use its exclusive right of initiative to bring a proposal back to the negotiating table whereby this programme could be funded under the next financial framework. As you know, you will have Parliament’s full support for such an initiative; however, we are asking you to go further. We feel that this programme must not be held ransom to intergovernmental talks on the common agricultural policy, nor should we subject it too literally to European Court of Justice judgments without reclaiming the legislative initiative. We are therefore calling for this programme to be a genuine solidarity programme; in other words, it should not be a burden on the European Social Fund. Otherwise, as I have already said, we will be using the poor to organise solidarity for the poor. That is not what we need. Lastly Commissioner, I would like to draw your attention to another matter: many people in this Parliament do not support macro-economic conditionality – you will never have our support for that – but do support subject-related conditionality and concentration on specific subjects. One of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy is to combat poverty and social exclusion. This provides all the legitimate basis we need for funding aid to the most deprived out of the EU budget. We ask you to strive for this, and to try to bring on board the Member States that are dismissing this call. Instead of counting them on a list, why not persuade them, and use your exclusive right of initiative as a means of prodding them along? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Vice-President, may I ask you to deliver a message to our President, to thank him and congratulate him on his action at the European Council? I believe that he had a significant impact on the debates by posing the question that is key for European identity: both that of the European social model and that of the democratic legitimacy of the processes embarked upon. This European Council has seen the signing of a treaty when even a government that is one of the most fervent advocates of a ‘Merkozy’ strategy now finds itself in difficulty. In my view, neither Spain nor the Netherlands could reasonably apply this treaty. I have understood, though, that in parallel, suddenly, our leaders have apparently discovered that they must also talk of growth, but not in the same way, not with the same golden rules, but with soft rules. I must say to you that there will be no more growth if you only apply the rule of the internal market, which is just a rule of negative integration, whereas your conclusions turn their back on the balance that had been enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy. You are unravelling this strategy and rewriting it after less than two years. The destruction of the European social model will not bring about more growth. There will not be more growth while those who claim they want to protect it are undermining the foundations of European identity. There will be more growth if you think, first and foremost, about jobs, joint industrial strategies, a European energy community and specific combating of tax evasion, instead of waiting countless months before negotiating and denouncing the unilateral strategies of some Member States. There will be no growth without consistent commitments by the Member States when we negotiate the financial framework and the introduction of an own resource on the basis of Eurobonds and a tax on financial transactions. Pervenche Berès,

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, I address this question to you because Parliament does not understand what is happening at the Council. In December, we adopted by a very large majority the Commission’s proposal to extend European Globalisation Adjustment Fund crisis measures. Now we see it has been completely blocked at the Council in an inconsistent move that we do not understand – for can we declare the crisis over? Can we really say that this fund has not been a useful reflection of the effects of this crisis on workers? Today, growth forecasts for European GDP are between 0.5% and 3%. Or is Mr Draghi mistaken when he cites these figures for future European growth? The Commission itself predicted an economic downturn of 0.3% across the European Union in its latest projections published in February, despite the fact that in November 2011, it was still expecting 0.5% growth in 2012. Where will the crisis end? The crisis facing those employed in industry threatens the very existence of European sentiment. It encourages scepticism towards the European Union. It causes us to turn our backs on the very essence of our peaceful coexistence and ignores the elements of social justice we could provide. Applications submitted under crisis-related criteria have only increased since this crisis has not gone away. I must tell you Mr President that within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we have had the opportunity to hear from Spanish and Lithuanian experts who told us how valuable this crisis mechanism was. Furthermore, I wish to bear witness here to the response of the German public authorities. The director of the European Social Fund group has testified to the exemplary nature of this mechanism in bringing about social innovation and enabling workers affected by this crisis to find a European answer to their problems. However, today, his government constitutes a majority in favour of blocking the extension of this mechanism. We do not understand this and ask you, on behalf of the Presidency of the European Union, to use all your power to break this deadlock. I believe those who consistently argue for more flexicurity. Flexibility certainly exists, with widespread redundancies – day after day, we see jobs disappearing. Provide a little bit of security, allow these workers to be given training, a transitional period as they adapt to the new situation they find themselves in. I am worried that if this is the position of the Council today on the extension of the crisis mechanism, what will happen tomorrow when, as part of the financial perspectives, we are to negotiate the extension of mechanisms to all farmers affected by free trade agreements? There comes a time when the Council must choose between real solidarity and fake solidarity. Today, we prefer evidence and we do not believe the time has come for happy announcements of growth that might one day lead to job creation, or for the abolition of one of the few tools at the European Union’s disposal to provide concrete help, support and solidarity to workers affected not only by globalisation but, above all, by the financial crisis. We are counting on you, Mr President. You must change the majority in the Council, including among those Member States that are today refusing this extension of the derogation, despite being exemplary users of these funds.

 Mr President, Ms Vestager, Commissioner, this is the fifth year running that the Spring European Council is to be held in an atmosphere of crisis. This is the fifth European Council held in an atmosphere of crisis and where, clearly, the logic is that out of austerity will come growth. I think that it is clearly time to take stock and admit that what comes out of austerity is recession and not growth. However, we have come together today to talk of a document that the Commission is adding to the work of the European Council, which goes by the name of the Annual Growth Survey. You must admit that there is something not quite right here and that it is high time to change our approach. First of all, in the name of our institution, the European Parliament, let me just say that we in this House are in total denial of democracy, because what is going on? The Spring European Council is adopting guidelines which are then going to be imposed on the Member States to define their economic policy strategy. On what basis is the Spring European Council going to reach its decisions? The Commission is trying to make its contribution in a direction that does not suit us, and yet it is tabling a Community document entitled Annual Growth Survey. Meanwhile, the Council is going to draw up the Euro Plus Pact on the basis of a scribbled note written by Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy, and then endorsed by the other institutions. In a democracy, the way in which broad economic policy guidelines are drawn up is the foundation of the social pact. That is why we have been fighting for this Parliament to have a say in the matter. We intend to do this on the basis of what the Commission persists in calling an Annual Growth Survey – we are calling for this to become annual guidelines for growth. We are calling on the Commission to face up to reality. Will this Annual Growth Survey enable the potential contradictions between the Stability Pact and the Europe 2020 strategy to be ironed out? Both Mr Gauzès’ and Ms Cornelissen’s reports – I should like to thank our two fellow Members for the spirit of cooperation that has marked our work – invite you to walk on two feet and, if you want to walk on two feet, you may at times have to turn your back on austerity and the Stability Pact. Otherwise, we shall never manage to implement the Europe 2020 strategy. We are also calling for a balanced approach to economic situations. That means that, when there are imbalances within the European Union, you have to look at both deficits and surpluses. Ms Vestager, as I have already said, for us, the Euro Plus Pact is not a basis for negotiation. Madam, just look at the figures. Today, everybody in Europe is in difficulties. Have you seen the OECD’s figures for Germany’s growth prospects for 2012? 0.4%. That is proof enough that even the most virtuous economy in the European Union cannot withstand the situation of recession into which the policies of this five-year term are leading the euro area and the European Union as a whole. Furthermore, look at the way that you are managing the EU’s tools. The European Social Fund is being used for anything and everything. On the one hand, you would like it to be a tool to apply macro-economic sanctions and, on the other, when it comes to creating jobs for young people, you want to mobilise the European Social Fund. These contradictions must be resolved and, to do this, I suggest you look at the reports that this Assembly is offering you as the European Parliament’s contribution to the work of the Spring Council. I hope that, via our President when he comes to talk to you, these guidelines, whether in economic or employment matters, will improve your road map because, if they do not, democracy and the European people will find themselves in a jam. Pervenche Berès,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, you said that the European Parliament had agreed not to change the guidelines. So be it. However, we would like to see these guidelines implemented and, in our reports, we make a certain number of proposals to provide you with the means to monitor this implementation. In particular, I should like to mention one proposal, the proposal to work with the Member States on a budgetary heading which would allow us to ascertain the contribution of the Member States, for example, to realising the objectives of the 2020 strategy rather than towards military expenditure or whatever else. Ms Vestager, thank you for being here today. You have said that you will report on this debate and the work of this Parliament at the 21 February meeting of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN). This is precisely what we would like to see. It is in that spirit that we would like to advance European democracy and it is also in that spirit that on 27 and 28 February, we shall meet with representatives of all the national parliaments to ensure that, in this European Semester, there is also room for the democratic dimension to thrive. Finally, Ms Vestager, may I call on you to take into account in the same way, during this ECOFIN Council, the new impact assessment that the Commission is due to publish tomorrow on the assessment of the tax on financial transactions.

Mr President, we are going to vote on Mr Siekierski’s report. On behalf of all our fellow Members and, in particular, the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we would like to say that we are going to accept the two-year extension of the Food Distribution Programme for the Most Deprived Persons, on the basis of the agreement reached at the Council. Simply speaking, bearing in mind the political conditions under which this agreement was reached at the Council, we would like to obtain a statement from the Commission on its vision for the future of this programme. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 – (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, we must not forget, all the same, that this proposal goes against the adoption of a so-called ‘golden’ rule. This is good because this new treaty does not include a single provision in favour of growth and employment while, on the other hand, you have this declaration, which you have today been charged with putting in place. When you are looking for good ideas to encourage youth employment, I would invite you to turn your attention to Parliament’s work, since we have drafted a report on youth employment in which I think you will find some good proposals. As for the use of the Structural Funds, we are still being bombarded with contradictions which are sparking debate. On the one hand, we want to mobilise Structural Funds to offset the golden rule but, aside from that, we want to use them to sanction the Member States. The time will come when we will have to choose where our consistency lies. How can the European Union work when it is being pulled in two directions? Then, when we are discussing fundamental financial perspectives, President Barroso’s movement questions us. Does the European Union’s budget not need to have resources at its disposal that can be used, depending on the situation, to implement countercyclical measures? In this case, are the proposals you have made for the future Structural Funds programmes adapted to the crisis situation the EU is currently experiencing? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

Blue-card question.

 Madam President, I would like to ask Mr Fernandes if he regards being concerned about the consequences of pension reform which excludes workers from the entire compensation and income system as getting involved in politics – clearly, coming from his mouth, this seems to be a bad thing. Mr Gauzès, who, to my knowledge, belongs to the same group, took the view that it had to be taken into account and that the government as shareholder should perhaps be concerned about this situation. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, the European Parliament, with a very large majority, pronounced itself in favour of extending the crisis mechanism within the framework of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). It is something of a paradox that some Member States – whose representative and member of the Council is not present to hear this debate and our arguments – refuse to extend the derogation within the framework of the crisis mechanism at a time when the OECD notes that the European Union and, in particular, the euro area is in recession, and has corrected the growth forecasts for next year to 0.2%. Where is the end of the crisis? I put the question to the Council. The reality is that there is a blocking minority in the Council which thinks that, since we are in a crisis, it is no longer necessary to apply the fundamental rule of the European Union, which is that of solidarity. I call on the Council to hear Parliament’s message. We demand solidarity within the European Union. Madam President, I would like just one second to talk about Renault. There are some in this Chamber who say that this is all about electoral manoeuvring. I call on the Commission to assume its responsibilities and to ensure that its right hand knows what its left hand is doing. I ask that, tomorrow, when it looks at how pension reform has been implemented in France, it takes into account the damage caused by Mr Bertrand and his pension reform and that it tells France that the disastrous effects of this pension reform must be corrected.

 Mr President, in tackling this report, Parliament is tackling the issue of democratic legitimacy in the context of economic policy. At a time when everyone is wondering about how economic policy will be handled and about the fate that the forthcoming Council meeting has in store for that policy for the member countries of the euro area, it is important for the European Parliament to express its opinion in order to establish what the democratic legitimacy of the debate on an economic policy coordinated at EU level might consist of. The European Commission has put forward the idea of a European semester in order to give direction to this debate before it takes place in the national parliaments. We believe that, as part of this European semester, we, the European Parliament, must be able to have our say with regard to the Annual Growth Survey that the European Commission is tabling as a key document for this debate. We believe that this document should be an economic policy-making document, which is why we are proposing that, in future, the Commission describe this document as what it is: not an annual growth survey, but an economic policy-making document aimed at sustainable growth. Because, otherwise, it is clear that economic policy coordination at Heads of State or Government level will go in an altogether different direction, that of a Euro Plus Pact, for example, or of who knows what other procedure they might invent in the future. No, we need a document from the Commission that gives direction to this debate, that incorporates the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and, of course, those of the Stability and Growth Pact. To ensure this, we also call for the European Parliament to be able to intervene straight away with quasi-codecision powers before the Spring European Council, and for the President of this institution, when he represents us at that Council, to be able to defend changes to this strategy, to this economic policy stance, on the basis of the mandate we shall give him. We also call for these powers to be recognised explicitly ascodecision powers in the future. Throughout this process, we believe that our cooperation with the national parliaments really must help to create this democratic legitimacy. This means that in February, before the Spring European Council, we must organise this meeting with the national parliaments in order to discuss what this economic policy stance will consist of. We must do so on the basis of what has already taken place and what is set to take place within this Parliament not only on the initiative of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, but also in cooperation with other committees, such as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. Then, once the European Council is over, we must organise a further debate, perhaps on a smaller scale, when the national parliaments themselves will have to ratify their national reform programmes. Lastly, we believe that this Parliament will clearly have to adapt to this new situation if it wants to be involved in this debate to establish the democratic legitimacy of the entire process. To ensure this, we know that we will have to adapt our ways of working, our practices to what is currently being implemented by both the Council and the Commission, and we state in this report that we are ready to do so. Lastly, with regard to the still uncertain prospect of a possible Treaty reform, we would make the following strong point: under the Treaty of Lisbon, this Parliament has rights that make it a key player in any Treaty reform process. We have already been consulted once on the reform of the Treaty when the European Stability Mechanism was implemented, and at that time we authorised this reform without an agreement. Given the issues that could potentially be discussed, we confirm today that we shall not allow such a reform to take place without an agreement. Discussions will have to be held with Parliament on both the time frame and the content of such a reform. It cannot simply be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union, so that economic policy is turned into a form of competition policy. We want this mandate to be a mandate for laying the foundations of EU economic policy, a solidarity and growth policy that is based on democratic legitimacy. As for the issue of how to achieve this, we also call for this Parliament to be involved, alongside the national parliaments, by means of an agreement. Democratic legitimacy is what gives the European Union added value. Pervenche Berès,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should first like to respond to Ms Ford, who has abandoned us. It is surprising to see an MEP from the United Kingdom express concern about the fact that a parliament is worried about democratic legitimacy. That does not match the impression I have of democracy as seen from the United Kingdom. I also wish to say to her that we are so insistent that the European Parliament should have the power of codecision when defining its economic policy guidelines precisely because we believe that, budgetary consolidation aside, this is one of the ways of ensuring that our concerns with regard to growth and with regard to funding for innovation, research and investment needs in industry are taken into account. President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to thank you for your insistence on the Community method, and to say to you that, while the Member States are, of course, sovereign powers, it is important that we also learn the lessons of this crisis. One of the lessons of this crisis is that ex-ante coordination of Member States’ economic policies has not worked well enough. To ensure that it does work well, and on an acceptable, democratic basis, in accordance with what the European institution stands for, I invite you, and your successors, on behalf of the Danish Presidency, to take full account of the observations that this Parliament will make on the 2012 Annual Growth Survey. Commissioner, you said that you did not want this exercise to be described as technocratic. It is up to us alone to make it a political economic-policy making exercise. I believe that this report contributes to this aim and I hope, Commissioner, that you will support us in improving the procedure and in ensuring that the Council genuinely takes account of the observations that this European Parliament will make. We shall come to the February part-session with observations on the content so that, together, we are more effective. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Vice-President Rehn, I think that you heard Mr Juncker when he talked about how the European semester should become a political tool. To that end, the founding act of the discussion – which is at least what we think you called the Annual Growth Survey – must become annual guidelines for sustainable growth. You have the chance, this time, to change it before next time, so do it. If this European semester is to be a debate about political guidelines, there will then be no economic government without Parliament involved, having its say, creating discussion around these political and economic guidelines. You must realise that, in 2012, this European Parliament might propose amendments to this Annual Growth Review, which would be debated at the European Council. That is what this Parliament is proposing. I hope that you can take it into account, because then you will be keeping democracy and political debate alive and national parliaments and the European Parliament will be involved in what must be genuine governance of the euro area and of the Union. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Daerden, for his excellent work. Commissioner, you fought and managed to get the objective of combating poverty included in the Europe 2020 strategy. Our current fear is that, with austerity plans, this essential objective may be overlooked. The conclusion of the agreement on the European food aid programme has left a nasty taste in my mouth as I fear that France and Germany have signed up to abandoning it definitively after 2014. That is not the thrust of the Europe 2020 strategy. We have a sovereign debt crisis and yet nothing should make us deviate from this strategy, as it is our road map, the one that we set for ourselves. In the fight against poverty, we must, in the platform that you have introduced, work on more precise indicators, as we still lack the ability to intervene in a targeted fashion with quantified objectives. This would allow us to benefit from intervention from the European Social Fund, in particular, targeted precisely at real trends in poverty. Then we would like the issue of minimum income to be raised clearly. We are calling for a consultation by the European Commission on a legal proposal of this nature. That, Commissioner, is your responsibility. We are also calling for the issue of accessibility to social services of general interest to be maintained. Finally, we are calling for the horizontal Anti-discrimination Directive to see the light of day. This is also crucial if this platform for combating poverty and social exclusion is to be a success. Pervenche Berès,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

 Mr President, we welcome the fact that the Commission’s draft budget has been restored in the areas that concern the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. The Commissioner was good enough to welcome this, and we feel this is important overall. This is the first budget since 14 January 2011, and hence the first since the Arab democratic revolution began. We welcome and back the European Training Foundation’s initiative to secure EU budget funding to help support industrial relations and the development of the labour market, in the context of the dialogue we will be entering into with these southern Mediterranean partner countries. Unfortunately, this is not the first budget of this economic crisis we are going through. We therefore feel that all initiatives that can be undertaken to support youth employment, especially through the pilot project we have begun, and the ‘Your first EURES job’ project for young people, are absolutely vital; and we hope that when the budget conciliation takes place, the budget for this project will be kept at the figure we voted for. Pervenche Berès,

 Madam President, Mr Dominik, Commissioner, Parliament’s intention in tabling this oral question was to contribute to a debate that we feel is absolutely crucial. When the Commission took the initiative to present this European Semester proposal, the idea was that economic governance should include a period of time for establishing European guidelines. This is, to some extent, a step towards the creation of this infamous economic government. We, the European Parliament, are worried about the fact that there might be an economic government without an economic ‘parliament’. We would like to hear your assessment of the democratic legitimacy of this European Semester. How does democratic debate on this European Semester fit in? Political debate on economic policy guidelines is the foundation of every democracy. If you raise the level at which economic policy guidelines are decided, then you must pay heed to the democratic debate and deliberation on those guidelines. That is what the European Parliament is trying to ensure and what we are challenging you on. I note that, during the European Council on Sunday, you brought up the European Semester and you managed to do so without once mentioning the European Parliament, or even, I have to say, the national parliaments. Do you think that that is acceptable? Similarly, the Commission pledged to present its next Annual Growth Survey in December. Very well. So be it. Why, then, have you not discussed it with us? Where is the democratic debate on this issue? When you table your new proposal, which assessment of the cycle that has just ended will you base it on? How are you incorporating the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives in your analysis of this European Semester? Furthermore, as Ms Bowles said – and I fully support her on this and on many other points in this matter – we are asking you to be completely transparent with regard to the amendments that you make to the country-specific recommendations after discussing them with the Member States. Otherwise, this exercise has no legitimacy and is meaningless. When you adopt the Annual Growth Survey, how much importance do you really attach to that document? Is it just a bureaucratic document to keep the European Parliament happy, or is it a genuine policy document? Unless we are mistaken, and your real objective is the Euro Plus Pact. We want some explanations on this point, Commissioner. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, with this report – and I should like to congratulate our rapporteur, Ms Bastos – we wanted to initiate dialogue with the European Commission. Your colleague, Ms Damanaki, reiterated on your behalf the proposals that you are making regarding the use of the European Social Fund (ESF), to ensure that 25% is dedicated to training and to the use of the ESF in every project. However, we are concerned about the idea that, at this time of crisis, which we have been debating all day long, we might penalise countries that are finding it difficult to meet the Stability and Growth Pact criteria by reducing the structural funds, particularly the European Social Fund. Europe will not have the means to rise to the challenge it faces, namely, overcoming the crisis and implementing the Europe 2020 strategy – for which the objectives of job creation and combating social exclusion are absolutely paramount – in this way. If we wish to successfully rise to this challenge, the issue of training, as Ms Bastos has suggested to us, is vital. That being the case, we also need to ensure that the creation of new types of jobs does not make us lose sight of one of the pillars of European democracy, namely, the functioning of social dialogue. We do not believe that it is necessary to depart from this idea of collective agreements, which have ensured the success of social democracy in Europe. Moreover, through your colleague, Commissioner, you also pointed out that the European Job Mobility Portal, EURES, is a precious asset when it comes to the free movement of persons throughout Europe. I believe that together, we need to take a fresh look at this matter so as to ensure the effective operation of this tool. I have heard it said, here and there, that we might be able to improve its functioning, and I would like it if we could work towards this together with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, like many who have spoken before me, I think that Ms Rühle’s report is a good one. Public procurement is an instrument with which public authorities can set an example. Consequently, this idea that the criterion of the most economically advantageous offer should replace that of the lowest price is somewhat in line with our demand at European level for the criterion of GNP no longer to be the only indicator. We are on the right track. However, if you are looking for ways of going further, you could also take the step of proposing bonuses and penalties for companies that fail to meet the requirements in terms of sustainable and quality goods and services when implementing these public procurement contracts. Furthermore, as you and many others have said, we want to be able to facilitate access for operators in the social economy through this review of public procurement rules at EU level. I should like to raise a third point, which I believe is absolutely crucial, namely, the issue of subcontracting. As you know, Commissioner, large worksites throughout the world are a real disgrace in terms of their compliance with social legislation. We cannot bury our heads in the sand and use competition or the risk of the Chinese winning contracts as an excuse. We need to make these contracts an example of excellence in social terms. This means that you have to review the chain of responsibility issue. Tenderers who win public contracts must shoulder their responsibilities, and that includes going and supervising letterbox companies that encourage modern-day slavery and which we cannot tolerate within the European Union. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, you are going to make new proposals on economic governance in competition with, or head-to-head with, the President of the European Council. At least this contribution has added value, though. Economic governance will not improve without democratic oversight, without democratic legitimacy. Do not forget that, at EU level, what goes on in the Council must be overseen by this House and that the ordinary legislative procedure ought perhaps to be considered within the scope of the European Semester. Moving on, I should like, if I may, to put some questions to you as the representative of your President, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso. Mr Barroso came here to deliver a speech to us on the State of the Union, which he hailed as probably one of his greatest speeches. Then, three days later, having denounced the role of the G20, he accepted instructions from a capital to apply macro-economic conditionality to the Structural Funds. Put simply, the regions, the poor and workers are being made to pay for what the capitals have been unable to implement. Do you consider that to be an example of good European governance? On 21 July, when you and the Heads of State or Government adopted the second bailout plan for Greece, you said that we needed a pillar to support economic activity, and you used the Structural Funds for that purpose. Why is it, then, that what was legitimate on 21 July has become an absurdity in your proposal on the Structural Funds? That is not good governance.  (Applause) Stéphane Le Foll  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, we have all gathered this morning to express our anger. There may be legal reasons for the decision that has been taken, but it makes no political sense. Indeed, it is politically indefensible, in the current crisis and under the current conditions, to reduce the food aid budget as you are proposing to do – aid that goes to our most deprived citizens. You cannot leave it there. You cannot. All the political groups in Parliament are calling on you to make the right decisions. We are not talking about EUR 500 million as opposed to EUR 100 million. We are talking about at least maintaining existing levels of food aid. Demand is growing in every country. Let me say a few words on the subject of agriculture. Once again, my comments are directed at the Commission. The question of agricultural stocks is not the same as it was 10, 15 or 20 years ago, when intervention stocks left us with huge surpluses. In the current European situation, we need a policy on food security stocks, both for Europe and for the rest of the world. I say this in the light of starvation levels around the world and the current situation in Europe. These are two very clear signals. You must reinstate a decent budget that will allow us to address this problem. In terms of agricultural policy, the Commission now needs to put forward clear proposals that will allow the creation of what we are calling food security stocks. The reality is that access to food is a major problem at the dawn of the 21st century, both in Europe and in the rest of the world. This morning, this House is sending you a very clear message. I hope that you are up to this massive challenge. Stéphane Le Foll,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Dess, Mr Dantin was cut off, but he was going to explain that the global food challenge is important, and it is important. As has already been said, this report, together with previous reports and the Commission’s communication, seeks to demonstrate that Europe’s aim is to have a common agricultural policy that guarantees food security in Europe and contributes to global food security. That entails political commitments on market regulation, which is what is under discussion today. We too will have to push for this in our debates at EU level. At a time when there are plans to eliminate Europe’s food security programme, we need to remember that food security is still a matter of solidarity and is still extremely topical in Europe: almost 30 million Europeans are currently suffering from malnutrition. Let us not lose sight of that fact. Essentially, this report sets out the broad thrust: the greening of agricultural policy. Of course farming needs to take a positive approach to environmental issues. In particular, it needs to focus on the European element and ensure that it is factored in by incorporating environmental issues into the first pillar. Another important point is that this compromise is the result of lengthy negotiations, in which I have always been involved, on the question of graduated support. At long last, support will be allocated in accordance with two criteria: employment – I believe that agricultural policy needs to allow for the notion of providing employment – and, of course, the production of public goods. This approach is better than continuing the debate on aid ceilings and never coming up with any solutions. I am making the point this afternoon because it is my honest opinion. Let me conclude by saying that this report and Parliament’s commitment are pointless unless the agriculture budget remains at its current level. That is my response to the comments made by the Commissioner and the President of the Commission on the second pillar. We cannot accept a budget cut. Stéphane Le Foll,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I fully agree with the remark that Mairead McGuinness has just made on the fact that there is a fundamental link between the issues of food and agriculture. The issue we are addressing is rising food prices and the consequences that may have for a certain number of populations around the globe, as well as in Europe. I would first like to make the following observation. The trend towards ever higher agricultural and commodities prices is, in my view, a long-term trend, which will continue for three main reasons: first, world demographic trends and a rising world population; second, the fact that, with global warming, we are experiencing problematic weather hazards such as drought and floods; third, because the world is also developing. With new emerging economies consumption levels are increasing. Therefore, the tight situation on agricultural markets and agricultural commodities is a trend that is on the increase. It is aggravated by price volatility, and price volatility is a consequence of the financialisation of the global economy. This is what we should be addressing if we want to resolve the agricultural issue and the food issue. To do this – what the Commissioner said is important – there are two elements: yes, there needs to be transparency on stocks, but we also need a public policy on stocks in Europe and stock management at a global level, especially at the level of the United Nations. Secondly, regulation of the financial markets and market speculation is essential, in particular by ensuring that there is no longer any connection between the speculative volume and the physical quantities exchanged on the markets. As regards food, it is unacceptable that speculators speculate without taking account of the consequences this may have for world food and humanity. This leads me to draw two major conclusions. Firstly, we need a strong European policy and to strategically reassert Europe’s commitment to being a global player in the food and agricultural sectors. Secondly, we need to change our development policy to ensure that globally – and Europe is a global player – we once again invest in agriculture, because we need agriculture to feed the world. (Applause) Stéphane Le Foll,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, I should like to speak without going back over the debate we have had up to now. We debated a 2011 budget under the constraints with which we are familiar, that is, those of a deep crisis affecting all of Europe with public deficits at national level which could lead to two hypotheses. Either these public deficits at national level pose a constraint on the European deficit, or these deficits at national level must give a new direction and a new lease of life at the level of Europe. That is the question. I am asking you, Commissioner, to try, above all, when we debate the budgetary review, when we are about to start to talk about the budgetary perspectives for post-2013, not to remain completely absorbed by this context of crisis, unless you are going to tell me and tell all European citizens that, in effect, Europe will remain in the crisis for a long time. Our entire problem really concerns how to manage the crisis and reduce our deficits and debt, and also how to prepare for extricating ourselves from the crisis. That is where the question of the budget comes in. We can only get out of the crisis, and Joseph Daul made this point just now, if the European budget, on account of being European, is able to provide us with the resources to recover what we are lacking today; that is growth, job creation, innovation, research. That is what is at stake and it is in these terms that we should debate the budget and not do what we are too often prone to do, that is, constantly harp on about the issue of the crisis and the issue of deficits, and the Council really excels at that. I observed that at Deauville, the German Chancellor and the French President even announced in anticipation a reform of the treaties, without having had any kind of discussion with Mr Van Rompuy, so as to punish all those States which failed to respect budgetary discipline in the future. That is where we have got to in the Council today, while Parliament is only asking for one thing, in particular of the Commission, and that is to try to move the European project forward, which happens through the budget. So, you have noted a certain number of issues on which we are entirely in agreement. There is a need for greater flexibility. Evidently, we must manage together to find the capacity to have a much more flexible budget because it is a necessity; Europe’s capacity for reaction is at stake. It is also, of course, a question of setting priorities and organising the European budget efficiently. We are all doubtless in agreement that it is a necessity. However, where we must be clear with one another is on the need for a timetable, on the need for us to set our objectives together. Commissioner, we cannot leave matters as empty words and promises, written texts which are extremely interesting and with which I agree almost 100%. Now we are going to have to get down to the practical matters and, in particular, to an essential issue that we have been skirting round, that of own resources. What do we need to do in order to have own resources tomorrow for Europe, or rather for all the citizens of Europe, so that we are all put back on the path to growth and on an even firmer path for the Europe of tomorrow to take? We await your ambitious proposals, Commissioner. Stéphane Le Foll  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, I too would like to welcome the work done by the rapporteur, Mr Bové, to welcome the Commissioner, and also to welcome the speech by Mr Dess, who spoke before me, on the objectives of this report. I feel it is very important to remember that, in this debate, we have to solve a problem linked to the volatility of agricultural prices and, above all, to the fact that, when prices rise, the increase is very quickly passed on to the distribution sector, but when they fall at production level, there is no knock-on effect for consumers. Therefore, there is clearly a problem with the way in which the chain is organised; there is clearly a problem with the way in which so-called added value is distributed within it. I believe that Mr Bové’s report offers ideas, in several areas, that we must take further – and here I am really addressing the Commission – in order to try and emerge from this fundamentally negative spiral. The first, of course, is to organise the chain and the balance of power within it. What proposals are we making to ensure that producers who work together and are organised carry more weight within the chain in order to negotiate? That is the question you asked, Commissioner, with regard to interprofessions, but it is also a question that relates to the contractual basis that is going to be implemented. I call for this contractual basis to have a European framework – a point made in the report. We cannot let each country solve this problem. There has to be a European framework. It must be flexible, but it must exist. This proposal, this course of action, is inextricably linked as far as I am concerned. Secondly, of course, there is the issue of price transparency. Here, I am in favour of creating this observatory, which we absolutely must have so that consumers can be kept informed of price trends. Those are the points I wished to make. I support the proposals that have been made and I hope, as Mr Dess said, that the rapporteur’s proposals receive the support of the majority. Stéphane Le Foll  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I understand that you had a short and happy night. I thank the Commissioner for listening throughout this debate and I would like to congratulate Mr Lyon on the work he has carried out in connection with the report he is presenting this morning. What is the aim here? To make people realise that, in today’s world, agriculture, food and the environment are challenges for the whole of Europe. That is the aim. What do we mean by that? Rejecting the renationalisation of the CAP and increasing cofinancing, that is the first point. Maintaining an agricultural budget that is a match for these challenges and this major issue of food security, that is the second point. Ensuring that agriculture can provide the public goods demanded by society, that is the third element. The fourth element is regulating and preventing market volatility, which I believe is essential. We must return to this topic and we need to go a little further still. My final point concerns the first and the second pillar. I warn all those who defend this structure – and they are perhaps right – that, ultimately, within the framework of the budgetary discussion, there is a danger of the first pillar being reduced significantly, with everything being transferred to the second pillar, itself cofinanced, which would contradict the objective we have set of avoiding the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy. I am saying that this morning because this is the debate we are holding. Commissioner, I would like to finish with a simple idea. The CAP was created at the same time as the European Economic Community. We are now in the European Union. I really feel that we ought to have a major policy … (The President cut off the speaker) Stéphane Le Foll,

 Mr President, it therefore falls to us to close these debates this evening, and it is already late. I would like, first of all, to excuse the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr De Castro, who is unable to be here with us this evening for reasons that you know. Like other Members of this House, he has been unable to leave his country to come and participate in our debates in Strasbourg. The issue with which we are concerned results from the general crisis being experienced by the entire agricultural sector. As we know today, we are experiencing a crisis and, above all, seeing a fall in prices and agricultural revenues that is affecting cereal producers, livestock producers, whether pork or beef producers, and also – and I say this on behalf of Mr De Castro – olive oil producers, and which is hitting and has hit dairy producers extremely hard. Faced with this crisis and this price fall, it goes without saying that Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wishes to find out from the Commission what we can do right now and in the future to escape this crisis and, above all, what measures could be adopted in the coming months to support farmers and to ensure that the agricultural markets are less volatile. The first question that I would like to ask the Commissioner is more specifically about the dairy crisis: what is the situation with regard to the measures adopted by Parliament and the Council concerning this dairy crisis and, in particular, to the application of the famous EUR 300 million milk fund that had been agreed? That is the first question because I think that, if we are going to take legislative decisions, then we must know how they are being applied. As I was saying, all types of production are currently being hit by a price fall and a deep crisis in the markets. That brings us to a question and to seek answers on what we might call market regulation and the way in which we can limit this infamous price volatility. Nobody complains when prices are rising, especially not farmers. It is European consumers who fear agricultural price rises, which limit their purchasing power and impact on their ability to buy agricultural products. It is when prices are low and when they are falling for long periods that producers are penalised in terms of their incomes and, above all, and most seriously for European agriculture, in terms of their abilities to invest and to prepare for the future. Agriculture is a hard industry; the investments are substantial and it takes a long time to obtain a return on those investments. We need to stabilise prices. Commissioner, the question from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its Chair, Mr De Castro, is composed of two points. Firstly, you have announced a number of dairy-related measures to be implemented before the end of the year. This is important. Can you give us some details of these? Secondly, there are specific measures that need to be taken on all the markets, not just dairy. Finally, the question that we wished to ask you is how the Commission plans to anticipate and prevent these price falls in the medium term. What market regulation mechanism can be used to limit sudden increases and, above all, sudden price falls? What work is the Commission currently doing and how does it view this issue? Those are the three elements that I wished to mention: the milk fund, perspectives on the dairy crisis and, more generally, the way in which the Commission intends to deal with this issue of price volatility and price falls.

Mr President, Commissioner, the report I am presenting to Parliament sets out to explain that the agricultural sector has a place and a role to play in the fight against global warming. This week, nature has reminded us – this time in the shape of volcanoes – that it can have a major impact on human activities and on the climate. However, this means that, in spite of everything, human beings and Europe in particular must take responsibility for combating what we refer to as global warming. My report aims to show that the agricultural sector can continue to reduce both its carbon emissions and its fossil fuel consumption and, above all, at the same time, can make a very active contribution to carbon fixation so that, at world level, we can achieve lower carbon emissions and ensure that a greater proportion of carbon is stored and captured. The report attempts to illustrate the need for agriculture to move away from a compartmentalised approach, which consists of introducing a new directive on soil, water, pesticides and so on, whenever there is a problem, towards trying to tackle the agricultural issue in a more comprehensive and systematic way. Within this type of approach, we will need to identify avenues which ensure, as I mentioned earlier, that the agricultural sector not only reduces its energy consumption but, at the same time, actively participates in carbon fixation. This role relates, in particular, to photosynthesis and biomass, and especially to an area that is close to my heart, which is soil and the capacity of European soils to store organic carbon. I believe that this approach, which I discuss in this report and which I hope will be endorsed during the vote that is due to take place in the Brussels part-session, will enable agriculture in Europe to enter a new phase of sustainability and to make the transition to a more environmentally aware state which would place it ahead of a number of other continents and other agricultural systems. In doing so, it would have a more positive impact both economically and environmentally and, as a result, a more positive impact in social terms. This report deals, therefore, with the specific issue of agriculture in relation to the fight against global warming, but it also claims – in any case I hope it does – to explore other ways of sustaining, in particular, the debate that will be taking place on the future of agricultural policy post-2013. I am addressing the Commission; I will be addressing the agricultural committees, as I have frequently done, and I will also be addressing the various ministers when I have the opportunity. I believe we need to change direction. The 2013 CAP needs to be ambitious. It must be based on goals that will help citizens to understand why we need a common agricultural policy. We need a common agricultural policy because Europe’s agricultural community needs both to ensure food security and to embark on the path of sustainability. In any case, this is the direction I propose in my report and the one in which I hope a large majority of Parliament will follow me. Stéphane Le Foll  (S&amp;D

Madam President, President Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, I would like first of all to say that, as far as the 2020 strategy is concerned, everyone agrees on the targets. However, the problem our continent has today is that it is emerging from a serious crisis, the characteristics of that being that we have extremely weak, or even negative, growth globally. This therefore requires political awareness and, for me, that has two goals. Firstly, that of knowing how we organise ourselves politically. In the positions you hold, you have two major responsibilities: to encourage coordination of economic policies – this is absolutely vital – and to set targets with tools to achieve them. This brings me on to the second goal, which I believe is essential, and, at the same time, it will be a question. To achieve goals in public policy, a budget is needed. Today, Europe is confronted with this dilemma: the Member States have significant deficits and the more significant their deficits, the less they will throw in Europe’s common pot. Therefore, we are less able to revive our growth. How do we solve this dilemma? This is the question I put to you. It depends on two elements. Firstly, what are the guidelines that you will defend when discussing the budgetary perspectives with the Member States? Secondly, are you able to move towards innovations that will allow the European Investment Bank and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development alike to assume much greater responsibility and – why not? – to enable Europe to borrow to finance this necessity, which is the growth of tomorrow?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall certainly repeat things which have already been said and welcome, in any case, the result of the Irish vote on the Treaty of Lisbon. I should simply like to draw the attention of the Members remaining in the House to the reasons for the change, because we are satisfied with the ‘yes’ but, a year ago, it was a ‘no’. What has changed? The text? Very little. The context? A lot. That is what matters. We can discuss institutional questions here. What the citizens are waiting for are political answers from Europe. That, to my mind, is the analysis that we need to make of this double vote. There is not just one vote, there are two. The ‘no’ to start with and then the ‘yes’. The Irish said that they needed Europe in the crisis and this needs to be heavily emphasised, because they are asking Europe to protect them and that is important. I shall repeat what numerous members have said. I think that we need to proceed quickly now. So we are turning to the Swedish Presidency of the Council and we are turning to the Commission. If we want to reply to the demand by the people of Ireland, we need to give concrete replies. The economic crisis: is Europe capable of stimulating growth on a European scale? The social crisis: is Europe capable of having an employment policy? For me, these are the subjects at the heart of the debate and I am satisfied with another thing which the Treaty of Lisbon gives us and that is that Parliament will have enhanced powers and, in the political debate, I think that it has an essential role to play and that is to show that there are various options and to debate those options. However, now, if this is to be a democratic debate and if Europe is to manage to provide replies, we quickly need to designate a Commission and to ensure that the Czechs ratify as quickly as possible so that Europe can get back on the road to growth and hope.

Madam President, Commissioner, I will be brief. I think that there are two parts to this debate. There is the immediate question of how we can extricate ourselves from this crisis. All measures, ranging from assistance for farmers to intervention measures, are necessary – in fact, absolutely necessary. We must endorse them and even call for them to be enlarged in scope. That is what we, together with several fellow Members, are proposing here in Parliament. Secondly, there is the structural question regarding the management of the dairy market, and this is where our views diverge from yours, Commissioner. You propose that we move in the direction of using contractual relations. I can tell you in advance that introducing contractual relations between industrial firms and farmers will, in the long term, result in those industries competing with each other, on a Europe-wide scale. In order to regulate a market, we need public regulation. There is no other solution. After this crisis, that is what the debate must be about. I think that, in this debate, we must respect all opinions and all options; I fear that we acted too quickly at the time of the health check to settle an issue such as quotas, which up until now, as I would like to point out to all those who have spoken, have made it possible to maintain dairy production in Europe, to ensure that the dairy industry is highly developed and, at the same time, to keep prices at a level that was easily affordable for customers.

 The objectives pursued by this regional convention: to replace more than 100 bilateral protocols with a single protocol; to integrate the countries of the Western Balkans into the pan-Euro-Mediterranean system of rules of origin; and to facilitate trade between the member countries, are contributing to the economic integration of the Euro-Mediterranean region, which has been a major objective of the EU’s Euro-Mediterranean policy since the Barcelona Process. In addition, its conclusion has been sought for a number of years by our partners in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean. After all the talk that accompanied the Arab revolutions, it is time to take action. The adoption of this convention will enable the EU to send for the first time a clear message of openness to trade to the countries of the southern Mediterranean, which are finally opening up to democracy. However, the convention alone will not suffice to bring about the major changes we are expecting in the EU’s trade relations with the southern Mediterranean. We therefore need to continue our efforts to support the development of South-South trade, to improve customs cooperation, to modernise the rules of origin themselves and, more generally, to review EU trade policy towards our Mediterranean partners, in that it should take more account of their interests.

 Mr President, on behalf of my four colleagues, I should like firstly to extend my warmest thanks to the MEPs who enabled the adoption of this initiative, and secondly to say that the European Parliament, in my view, is sending a very strong message today to our southern partners and, especially, to their young people, and that Parliament now expects the Commission to make proposals promptly so that the Erasmus and Leonardo programmes actually become a reality for these countries.

I voted in favour of the report by my fellow Member, Mrs Balzani, defining the position of Parliament in the forthcoming negotiations on the 2012 budget. Today, the European Parliament has given instructions to those of its Members who will represent it before the Council and the Commission in the budget negotiations starting on 11 July. If there is a message in this vote, it is that the vast majority of us are intent on warning the Council against any attempt to reduce the European budget. We are not of course advocating spending for spending’s sake. We are well aware of the terrible crisis ravaging our continent. However – and the Socialists have been saying this for a long time – Europe will not emerge from this crisis by sacrificing its future and selling tomorrow’s growth on the cheap. We should, rather, have the courage to speak out and not fear confronting populism. We do not need less Europe. We need more Europe. Until we give the Union the resources it needs to fulfil its ambitions, it would be an illusion to believe that it will be able to return to the path our citizens want to go down.

This resolution, which I had a hand in drawing up, comes at a critical moment, and thus a key moment, in the resolution of the conflict in South Sudan. In January, the South Sudanese overwhelmingly voted for their independence in a referendum. In one month, a new state will be born. However, there are still several concerns, especially after the recent incidences of violence in the disputed Abyei region. More than ever, in this pivotal period, Parliament intends to reaffirm its complete support for the peace process and to appeal to the Sudanese and South Sudanese, as well as the international community, to remain committed to implementing the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement. In particular, the European Parliament is calling on the Sudanese and South Sudanese to propose specific plans taking account of sensitive subjects, namely citizenship, the sharing of debt and of oil revenues. These plans will also have to deal with the difficult issue of borders in order to ensure that a peaceful and viable coexistence of the two states can be maintained. Vincent Peillon  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report by Mr Coelho proposing the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the ‘Schengen area’. This is one of the greatest achievements of the European integration process. The accession of a new State is conditional on strict compliance with the criteria of the Schengen Agreement. In the case of Bulgaria and Romania, the European Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties – like the European Commission – has concluded after evaluation that these two States meet the conditions laid down in full. Consequently, there is no longer any reason why they cannot integrate into this area of free movement. I would find it unacceptable if certain States, under false pretexts and motivated by internal political calculation, continued to oppose it. The Community acquis should not be regarded as an à la carte
 system where Member States can adapt or suspend provisions as circumstances dictate. Therefore, I solemnly call upon the Council to acknowledge the improvements made by Bulgaria and Romania and admit them into the Schengen area. Vincent Peillon  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the Audy report on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme on research and development. With this text, the European Parliament confirms its support for this programme, which is of vital importance for developing European research and improving the competitiveness of our businesses. It defends the establishment of a permanent budget, which is essential if it is going to be able to meet its targets. This report then sets out specific proposals with the aim of resolving the programme’s weaknesses. It rightly highlights the need to simplify funding procedures and optimise existing instruments, so as to facilitate access for small and medium-sized enterprises. Finally, this report reminds us that the European Commission needs to ensure that promoting innovation does not endanger the progress made in basic research. Vincent Peillon  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report presented by Mr Garriga Polledo on behalf of the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013. In a context where populism is on the increase, the effectiveness and even relevance of EU policies are regularly brought into question. Nonetheless, in the face of current crises, whether financial, economic, social or climatic, we do not need less but rather more Europe. This report therefore proposes finally giving the EU the resources to match its ambitions, by arguing for a substantial increase in the EU budget of a minimum of 5% and a mobilisation of the budgetary resources of the Union for the benefit of the EU 2020 strategy. Thanks to action by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the European Parliament also argues in this report for two strong measures: as far as revenue is concerned, an in-depth reform of the own resources system, in particular, through the creation of a tax on financial transactions (Tobin tax); as far as expenditure is concerned, the creation of a category of ‘intermediate regions’ to increase solidarity between the territories of the EU and ensure a fairer distribution of the regional policy’s Structural Funds.

 I voted against the resolution on the lessons to be drawn for nuclear safety in Europe following the nuclear accident in Japan, because I do not believe that the issue of the future of nuclear power – a crucial one for our fellow citizens – can be resolved by this House in a few hours through amendments adopted without any real debate. All the issues must be put on the table, and no options must be ruled out, which is exactly why we need time. At stake are the credibility of our Parliament and the wellbeing of our fellow citizens, who would not understand – and rightly so – if we were to commit them to long-term courses of action that we did not discuss calmly and exhaustively beforehand, taking into account the different national situations and the constraints of our common fight against climate change. Lastly, I should like to say how sorry I am that, due to extremists on all sides, Parliament has been unable to approve at this time an immediate increase in the safety of nuclear power plants, even though we in our group reached a consensus demanding the most serious, transparent and independent checks possible.

I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague and friend, Mrs Guillaume, on procedures for granting and withdrawing asylum in Europe. This text marks a major step forward in establishing a common European asylum system (CEAS) by 2012, thereby putting an end to the intolerable situation whereby, depending on the European country in which an asylum seeker applies for protection, his or her chances of being recognised as a refugee vary between 1% and 65%. Parliament has therefore spoken out in favour of greater justice and greater efficiency in the processing of asylum procedures. It proposes that each country observe the same enhanced rules on protecting rights and modernising procedures: free legal advice from day one, a framework for the time limit for appeals, special assistance for unaccompanied minors, and a faster examination of cases. Also, although I regret that the European right, which has a majority in Parliament, has managed to adopt amendments to the text which cast widespread, exaggerated suspicion on the sincerity of asylum seekers, I warmly welcome the adoption of this report. The ball is now in the court of those Member States that have yet to decide on our proposals. Vincent Peillon  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague and friend, Mr Arif, on the EU’s foreign direct investment (FDI) policy. With this document, Parliament formulates two, in my opinion, major requirements when defining how to frame future international investment protection agreements that are binding on Europe. The first requirement is that all these agreements include clauses compelling European investors to behave responsibly abroad in economic, social and environmental matters. The second requirement is that all these agreements leave scope for the governments of the countries receiving this investment to legislate for the common good. In the past, some private investment protection clauses enabled the adoption, by the third country, of social or environmental legislation to be regarded as indirect expropriation, resulting in compensation. We need to put an end to these abuses. While this Parliament has, for the first time, a say on such matters, the Arif report has fired a warning shot across the bows of the Council and the Commission as they prepare to open negotiations with India, Canada and, soon, with China.

 Mr President, I should like first of all to thank Mr Kalfin for the excellent work we have been able to carry out together and, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for which I was the rapporteur, to thank my colleagues Mrs Hautala, Mr Lambsdorff and Mrs Giannakou. As he has done so himself, I am not going to review the positive points of the report and the proposal defended by Mr Kalfin on the climate change mandate, the increase in human resources, the attention paid to social and development aspects, the environment, human rights, the shift in focus of the guarantee towards countries that need it most, and a stronger link with EU policies. Parliament is united on all these points – let me make that clear – and it must remain so during the difficult negotiations that, as I have just heard, await us with the Council. I would like to draw attention to two shortcomings at this stage. I regret that neither the need to now prepare the EIB for microcredit nor the need to already begin the debate on the post-2013 ceilings has been taken on board, even though the Committee on Foreign Affairs voted for both of these things in the consensus reached by all the political groups. That is why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament decided, with the consent of Mr Kalfin and of the other rapporteurs, to table amendments in plenary on these two subjects. Lastly, there is one crucial point to which I should like, politically speaking, to draw your attention and which has been the subject of debate for years. When the Berlin Wall fell, we were able to react not only with the enlargement project, the practical arrangements of which some may question, but which is undeniably necessary, but before that, we established the EBRD so as to be able to support the necessary economic and democratic transition. The European Union, and also the EIB, as the power behind it, is the largest provider of funds to the other side of the Mediterranean. At the same time, however, we know that the payment of those funds will not continue beyond one programming period – in other words, beyond 2013, as I mentioned just now – and that the discussions that we are having today show that there may be difficulties in the future. There is a project – already adopted by the European Parliament and endorsed in the report on the Union for the Mediterranean – which is referred to in the Kalfin report being debated today, and it is the creation of a Euro-Mediterreanean codevelopment and investment bank. This would be a practical way, beyond rhetorical statements, of acknowledging the European Union’s will to support the major democratic movement taking place on the other side of the Mediterranean, and I hope that this will be seriously addressed and that steps will be taken, in the coming months, to promote the creation of that bank. Vincent Peillon,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, I should like to start by expressing my warmest thanks to all my colleagues who were involved in this report; this truly is a collective piece of work. We reached 28 compromises; compromises which enriched rather than watered down the strategic vision that we wanted to impart to this report, to our commitment to the Mediterranean. I should therefore like to extend my warmest thanks to Marietta Giannakou for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), Ivo Vajgl for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Hélène Flautre, and the rapporteurs for the opinions of the Committee on International Trade, Mrs De Sarnez, and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Mrs Tzavela. What was important, for us, was to make it understood that there are strategic issues at stake here for Europe. In fact, it is not just a question of thinking that the South needs us; we also need the South, especially in these times of crisis. If we want to have a long-term vision, if we want sustainable growth in a multipolar world, then we also need the South. In light of this, Europe needs to undertake to make the Union for the Mediterranean an area of peace, security and prosperity for its 800 million habitants and to look at this work as a long-term priority. It is this common will that allowed us to come together, because we know that the economic stakes, the demographic stakes, the geopolitical stakes that we are facing, like the social and cultural stakes, presuppose that we are capable of working with the other side of the Mediterranean. For us, it is also cultural and civilisation issues that are at stake. We know this; Parliament has worked in knowledge of the difficulties of setting up the Union for the Mediterranean for two years. We have not avoided tackling the question of conflicts taking place in the South, but we wanted to affirm very forcefully that it was precisely the approach of the Union for the Mediterranean, with specific projects, parity between North and South in decision-making bodies and the possibility, for example, of bringing Israelis and Palestinians to the same table, that was the right method for helping to resolve these conflicts and that, moreover, the Union for the Mediterranean should not be asked to pursue all the objectives at the same time and that it needed to focus on these specific activities. In this project – and I do hope that the second summit of Heads of State or Government will be held in Barcelona on 7 June – we, the European Parliament, wanted to send a strong message to the Heads of State or Government to tell them they must make a commitment because this summit must be a success. In light of this, we have pointed out the approaches that we think are necessary today. First of all, we need to remove certain obstacles, which, of course, include the financial and economic conditions. That is why the European Parliament hopes that the European Union will make a financial commitment commensurate with what is at stake, firstly in terms of what is left of the financial perspective 2007-2013, and that, in the financial perspective 2014-2020, the Union’s undertaking will be much greater, so that the six major projects on the table can be completed. We need to improve the economic and legal environment. We need to improve South-South regional integration. We also need, in addition to economic conditions, new political conditions, which is why we placed an emphasis on cultural integration, education, cultural projects and on the rights of men and women. To conclude: Europe, in this crisis, needs to look far and wide. We must not sacrifice the long term to the short term. We must assume our responsibilities. Europe needs the South. Vincent Peillon,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make three brief comments. Firstly, we have not been lacking in respect for anyone, especially not people who might be victims, but we considered that compassion, moral indignation and insults do not add up to a policy. Secondly, we have not, of course, ignored the conflicts which exist either in Cyprus or in the Sahara or, of course, in the Palestinian territories. Seriously, however, did we think, in the common foreign and security policy or in the various negotiations that have taken place, that it was up to the UfM to deal with these issues? You cannot be everything to everybody and confusion of the mind is not a recipe for efficiency. Thirdly, I too am sorry that the Council is not here. It is not a good sign when you find out that this lack of political will is giving us cause to believe – Dominique Baudis is right – that the summit on 7 June is in the balance. Be that as it may, Parliament will have assumed its responsibilities. The people who constructed Europe did so with a long-term vision and a keen sense – following the fratricidal wars that divided us – of the importance of specific policy. It is this same spirit that we wanted to develop with the Mediterranean in this report. With Europe in the throes of a major crisis, we need to be capable of defining a growth strategy, as I said earlier. We also need to ensure that we do not turn in on ourselves. When you turn in on yourself, when you stop having exchanges with the outside world, then you start to die. That is why I think that this collective piece of work is an important piece of work and I hope that the Heads of State or Government – who have not recently lived up to their historic responsibility – listen and take heed.

Madam President, as our fellow Members have said repeatedly this morning, the problem of financing the developing countries’ fight against global warming may cause the Copenhagen Summit to fail, when we were all hoping it would be a success. As we know, however, these countries are often the main victims of global warming, but they are not responsible for it. The industrialised countries have provided a substantial financial aid package. It is insufficient today, and even the declared amounts are not actually being honoured. This is what obliges us and will oblige us to find new sources of finance. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, following the lead of the Committee on Development, has acknowledged that there is now a need to consider the introduction of a tax on financial transactions of the Tobin tax kind. This 0.01% tax on speculative transactions would bring in USD 100 billion per year; in other words, the amount that it is estimated will be required by 2020 to combat global warming in developing countries. Therefore, Parliament, in following the lead of certain national political leaders, is assuming its responsibilities. I should like to know the position of the Council and the Commission and whether they will support us on this point.Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the strengthening of the rules on the removal of sharks’ fins on board boats. The existing rules permitted exemptions that meant that compliance with the ban on this cruel practice, which involves throwing live sharks back into the sea having removed their fins, could not be guaranteed. While sharks’ fins are the main ingredient in a highly-valued Asian soup, the rest of the meat is less sought-after. There is a great temptation to keep only the valuable part of the shark and to throw the rest of the carcass away, leading to overfishing of an animal of which many species are endangered. However, while the requirement that any fins landed must be attached to the body of the animal should facilitate controls, I remain convinced that the lack of resources allocated to these controls – concerning not only shark finning but also other species – remains the central problem with regard to overfishing, causing harm to the environment and to the overwhelming majority of fishermen, who carry out their work in a responsible and courageous way and face unfair competition that flouts all of the rules.

 I voted in favour of the new certification rules for two-or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles because ultimately they will improve safety for two-wheel users, who are very vulnerable, representing as they do a sixth of deaths on European roads, despite travelling only 2 % of the total distance. Anti-lock braking systems will be mandatory for motorcycles over 125 cc, and the increase in cost should be generally limited by the widespread implementation of this equipment, as has been the case with automobiles. Furthermore, new antipollution standards will be applied gradually between 2016 and 2020. Finally, the entry into force of this regulation in 2016 will signal the end for French motorcyclists of the 100 hp restriction on motorcycles, which has never really proved effective in terms of road safety and could cause insurance cover problems, for example, for a non-restricted vehicle bought abroad.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Monti report’s observation in 2010 was that the rules of the single market were focused primarily on competitiveness and trade in goods, and took no notice of citizens. To put this right, the Commission has presented 50 proposals to relaunch the single market, 12 of them legislative priorities that are currently being examined and are about to be approved. On the 20th anniversary of the single market, which we celebrate this month, the Commission is announcing a new set of proposals for the single market, entitled Act II. These include measures that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has been asking for for a long time, and we are delighted to see them become a reality at last. I refer in particular to the section on social entrepreneurship, cohesion and consumer confidence. I am delighted at the forthcoming improvement of rules on product safety, which is of prime importance for consumers, and at universal access to bank accounts, and the transparency needed on bank account fees. This legislation can demonstrate that Europe protects its citizens, is useful and is not just about austerity policies. The EU has not given up on its social model. We have a duty to maintain this courageous ambition, despite the handicaps. On the other hand, when it comes to Europe being protective and instilling confidence in its citizens, I am slightly more dubious about the proposals on transport and energy networks. I fear that the Commission is still stuck with its ideology of liberalising sectors of the network when we are still a long way from demonstrating the benefits for users, whether in terms of price or quality of services. It seems to me a more pressing issue to respond to the concrete expectations of citizens and consumers with legislation on collective redress, and framework legislation on public services, which we have been asking for for too long. Mr Barroso’s poor communication on public services was clearly not up to the challenge because these services also have a role in the revival of growth in a new industrial strategy. Similarly the Commission is congratulating itself on the potential for mobility that the single market offers citizens. This is to state the obvious, but it would be even better if there were a guarantee that social rights and pension rights would be recognised. The issue of mobility lies at the very heart of the legislation on recognising professional qualifications, on which I am rapporteur. The directive has to and will show that Europe can give real added value to growth, to employment and to its citizens, thanks to smart cooperation between all the institutions and in all the Member States. I am thinking particularly of the major innovation of a European Professional Card. I would like to thank my colleagues for the interest they have shown. We received more than 650 amendments. I know that we will reach some worthwhile compromises, including on sensitive issues like notaries and nurses. All that will remain is for us to persuade the Council to overcome the hesitancy of some Member States, because this is the message we need to give. Yes, the EU can and must be a source of progress and shared wealth to achieve positive, active solidarity between all of its Member States, driven by the same spirit of success from their shared destiny.

This report paints a picture which, regrettably, is hard to deny: we are very far from the goals set in 2004 and 2009. Creation of the Single European Sky is supposed to cut CO2
 emissions by 50 million tonnes and create 328 000 jobs, despite the constraints on growth in the sector as a result of the crisis and increased fuel prices. But, knowing the situation, I am unsure whether it is appropriate to penalise states which do not fulfil their commitments by the cut-off date of December 2012. The introduction of functional airspace blocks is a highly ambitious objective which has implications for national sovereignty and requires the interaction of air traffic control systems that are structured differently and operate differently, so it takes time to ensure a smooth and safe transition. I would be more in favour of incentives, and I think that, before putting forward a new ‘regulatory package’ when this one has not yet been properly implemented, we ought to … wait and conduct some serious assessments.

 The amendments to pharmacovigilance legislation finally introduce the principle of the automatic evaluation of a medicinal product at EU level if the product is withdrawn in a Member State. They also extend the list of drugs subject to additional monitoring. However, the Commission did the very bare minimum after the Mediator scandal. We should remember that its initial proposals on the texts adopted in 2010 were quite simply unacceptable. We had to fight to get rid of measures that were very favourable to the laboratories, making it easier for them to put on the market drugs that had been insufficiently tested with no therapeutic justification in terms of risk and benefit. Unfortunately, these minor changes do not integrate the fundamental measures we had asked for: the financial, hierarchical and intellectual independence of pharmacovigilance activities relating to the industry and medicines agencies, and the implementation of the requirement to demonstrate therapeutic progress in order to obtain a marketing licence. Nonetheless, Ms McAvan’s reports still represent progress in the expectation that a truly ambitious text will be proposed at the earliest possible opportunity. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Single Market Act is to make the market work for citizens again and to bring them and the market together, whilst recognising that an efficient single market can and must give rise to growth and sustainable job creation. Yet, the content of the recent legislative proposals and communications from the Commission show that its concerns are still predominantly focused on the promotion of trade to the detriment of measures aimed at employment and citizens. Some major issues are absent, namely: the promotion of good-quality jobs and rejection of social dumping, safeguarding the social protection model and public services, the portability of social and retirement rights, consumer protection in financial services and the right to collective redress. Parliament must remind the Commission that citizens want and need an innovative Europe that is able to create growth, protect them and also restore their confidence. The resolution that we will adopt tomorrow must send a strong signal in this direction. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, my question is for Commissioner Barnier. Would you mind telling me, please, how much progress the Commission has made with drafting legislation to provide operators in the social and solidarity-based economy with a status? I am referring to mutuals, foundations and cooperatives. These kinds of organisation indeed play a crucial role in cushioning crises and creating jobs and must therefore be protected, supported and encouraged to develop very quickly. Finally, if something concrete is in fact being drafted for the social economy, can we really be content with a simple communication on a quality framework for services of general interest which, in these times of economic and social crisis, also need to be protected by a genuine legal status? Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr Barnier knows as well as we do, and Parliament and the Commission must work together on this point, just how important this sector is for social cohesion and how much it needs legal certainty in order for social services to be exercised in EU countries. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Mr President, this partnership agreement with Morocco for agriculture and fisheries is an important act concerning a country that has had a shared history with Europe for centuries and is an important trading partner, with which the European Union maintains a net trade surplus. I understand the concerns that have been expressed. Although I have some doubts about certain political hijacking, or exploitation with regard to the rights of the people who are affected but not involved, I also have the same questions about the consequences of the liberalisation on the sectors of activity that are already highly vulnerable. That is why it is essential, Commissioners, to put in place effective compensatory measures to avoid any negative repercussions on European production and jobs. On that condition, I support this agreement because economic expansion in Morocco is an essential lever in consolidating a democratic process that all of us in this House sincerely want to see in that strategic part of the Mediterranean basin.

 Following the example of all the French socialist Members, I abstained on the vote on the Council agreement on the draft intergovernmental treaty adopted by the Heads of State or Government on 30 January. This agreement is not only legally questionable, as it flouts the role of Parliament, but also harmful, because the budgetary restrictions imposed will not resolve the crisis but, on the contrary, can only aggravate the recession. The renegotiation that we are calling for is a logical consequence of that. We must create growth in order to come out of this crisis: this is an economic necessity, and the dogmatic view imposed by Merkozy is not remotely adapted to this. We must restart a virtuous circle by coordinating our economic policies with major joint industrial projects, particularly in the fields of energy and the environment, and by boosting major infrastructure. This can only be achieved through the creation of Eurobonds, which are completely absent from this text, and true regulation of the financial markets, which we have long been calling for. Mr Sarkozy and Ms Merkel’s obsession with strict austerity is becoming dangerous for the whole of Europe. Bernadette Vergnaud,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Pervenche Berès on this outstanding report; it is the culmination of several months of work involving nine parliamentary committees. Thus, in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Catherine Stihler’s opinion emphasised the central role of the single market – the economic pillar of the EU – at the heart of governance focused on the aim of sustainable, inclusive and social growth, in line with the Europe 2020 strategy and in the interests of all our fellow citizens. If we are to take up this challenge, however, we must ensure that the European semester is not just an intergovernmental control system that imposes the diktat of certain Council Members on the national parliaments. Parliamentary consent to the public budget is one of the foundations of democracy. Hence it is imperative that the Annual Growth Surveys be adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure, with the European Parliament and the national parliaments cooperating closely with each other. This is a democratic requirement, and we must stand our ground. Bernadette Vergnaud,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, professional mobility is a key factor for competitiveness and growth in Europe, and is an integral part of the EU 2020 strategy and the Single Market Act. It relates to one of the fundamental rights of the EU: freedom of movement and of establishment. However, it remains limited because we are still lacking simple, clear rules for the recognition of professional qualifications. Repeated tidying-up of legislation does not hide the anachronism of some mechanisms that date back to a time when cross-border mobility was still anecdotal. The fact is that today, 50% of young Europeans are willing to go and work in another Member State, and the new directive will need to take up that challenge. This is a major project. The lack of basic harmonisation of training, the high number of regulated professions and the complexity of the recognition process create legal uncertainty, so much so that this issue accounts for 16% of the complaints made to the SOLVIT network. The main aim is to simplify procedures for citizens, guarantee transparent decision making and reduce delays through better cooperation between competent authorities and between Member States. The classification of economic activities should also be reviewed, because professions and related training requirements are constantly evolving. I welcome the fact that the report focuses on the specificities of the health care professions, due to the implications in terms of patient safety, of course. Finally, I clearly support the creation of a voluntary European professional card system. This type of card should, in particular, facilitate the steps involved and improve consumer and patient safety. Beyond that, this card will help to build a European identity and show that the single market is not only about movement of goods and people, but that it can and should be the basis for economic wealth and shared citizenship. I therefore congratulate Ms McClarkin on this good report, which, I hope, will be widely adopted tomorrow. Bernadette Vergnaud,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, public procurement is a wonderful tool for reviving the European economy, creating quality jobs and choosing more socially and environmentally sustainable offers. To achieve all these things, we have to change our policy of making the lowest price the sole criterion: it is the bedfellow of mediocrity insofar as it obliges public authorities to undertake convoluted procedures in order to choose quality. The report on which we will be voting tomorrow introduces the criterion of the most economically advantageous offer, which enables authorities to demand that tenderers meet high standards. I am grateful to Ms Rühle for having defended this principle so well; it will give operators greater flexibility and greater legal certainty. Another key point is access to public procurement markets, under favourable conditions, by operators in the social economy and small and medium-sized enterprises. European rules are very restrictive for these organisations. They must be improved so that these organisations can respond to major invitations to tender without having to act as subcontractors. In this regard, the very frequent use of this system presents real problems for SMEs affected by tariff dumping and for their employees, who do not benefit from the same pay and social conditions as their counterparts who are employed by large groups. A chain of responsibility must be envisaged. It is unacceptable for main service providers to be allowed to transfer their responsibilities to small subcontractors. I therefore call on you to vote in favour of maintaining paragraph 22, so that employees’ rights are respected and job-creating small businesses are protected in every Member State. Lastly, I am pleased that the Member States have been asked to sign ILO Convention C94 on labour clauses (public contracts). That Convention has been around since 1949, but only 11 Member States are signatories to it. However, I regret that it has not been possible to go further with regard to reciprocal access to public procurement markets in industrialised and emerging third countries. Europe can no longer be the only one to respect the rules, and therefore I ask you to vote against the deletion of paragraph 29. This report is a balanced text, and I call on you not to distort it tomorrow. Doing so would undermine the interests of our industry, our businesses and workers. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

I have declared my support for Mrs Sender’s report as it is not only a major step forward for road safety but also for European citizenship. How can we make motorists understand that they have to obey the rules in their country when they see drivers with foreign plates committing offences with total impunity? It is, above all, an issue of equality before the law. Whilst I can only regret that three Member States have refused to participate, it is a first step towards harmonisation and the objective is clearly road safety, as only serious offences, rather than, for example, parking offences, will result in follow-up cross-border proceedings.

 Following the example of the French Socialist delegation, I voted against the Roth-Behrendt report on EU legislation on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) and on related feed and food controls. It is difficult to understand, 15 years after the start of the mad cow crisis, how we could act as if nothing had happened and how we can envisage putting animal meal intended for ruminants back onto the market, even if subject to strict controls. The current crisis in the livestock sector, linked, in particular, to rising world cereal prices, has to be resolved by regulations at the economic and trade level and by combating speculation, and certainly not by endangering health security. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have been working on this issue for three years now and, in view of the challenges and the huge lobbying efforts of the food industry, I am delighted with the result achieved. I particularly welcome the introduction of mandatory complete nutritional labelling, which will enable consumers to choose healthy products. Allergens will be clearly listed, including for non-prepacked food, and a minimum font size will improve the legibility of information. Mandatory origin labelling for all meat is a real step forward. I hope we will be able to extend it to milk products and to processed fish and meat. It was also essential that alcoholic beverages were not included, Commissioner, because, in my view, they should be subject to specific, specially adapted rules. We could have done better, particularly by introducing legible and harmonised front-of-pack nutritional labelling. However, a major step has been taken toward the civic education of European consumers. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Twenty years after it was introduced, 112 is certainly accessible in all Member States, but only 26% of EU citizens know about it. This is an unacceptable state of affairs, which is why I have fought for Parliament to send out a message to the Commission and to Member States. I therefore welcome the vote on Mrs Rapti’s report calling for improvements to service quality and to the information available about this number. More effective regulation is needed, and it is important that we promote the exchange of best practice and ensure that EU funds are properly allocated. It is essential for automated caller location during emergency calls to be faster, and for the future of 112 to be guaranteed by ensuring the reliability of calls made via Skype. We must also introduce the ‘reverse 112’ automated SMS alert system for use in the event of a disaster. As regards universal service, whilst in the long term the plans are to extend the universal broadband service only, I am delighted in particular with the reminder of service providers’ obligation to abide by EU rules on neutrality on the networks. It is unacceptable that their customers might not be able to access the services, content and applications of their choosing over the Internet. Thank you. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 This vote is important because the Commission has to take the necessary measures to prevent unfair competition and non-reciprocity of access to public contracts in relation to third countries. This is not about erecting protectionist barriers, but the Union can no longer be the only one to play by the rules. Indeed, we can no longer ignore the social and economic dumping practised by companies in emerging countries who are winning contracts in countries of the Union, in defiance of social rights and legislation on State subsidies, while, in the meantime, the markets of these countries are closed to European companies. However we must also not forget that the large industrialised countries, despite signing international agreements, do not play by the rules either! After years of inaction, the Commission seems intent on acting, and that is necessary: the survival of our companies and jobs depends on it. Finally, I welcome the adoption of the amendments put forward by the Group of the Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament with regard to compliance, in the context of public procurement, with working, social and environmental standards in force in the Member States. It is now for the Commission to size up this call. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate all those MEPs who had a hand in drafting these reports. I think that we have managed to produce three balanced texts, which send a strong signal from Parliament to the College of Commissioners about our priorities for a Single Market that operates effectively on behalf of our citizens, for growth and for enterprises. As shadow rapporteurs for Mr Buşoi’s report, we have created a clear road map for the Commission. Firstly, and here we are all in agreement, Commissioner, there is a proposal for a legislative framework for public procurement, public/private partnerships and service concessions which should protect small operators, SMEs and awarding local authorities, and which will guarantee reciprocity between the EU, the industrialised countries and the major developing countries. Then there is the need to ensure that we prioritise the common consolidated corporate tax base and a clear VAT framework. That is crucial if we want our SMEs to flourish within a healthy competitive environment. Finally, we must ensure that innovation is funded, in order to stimulate strong and sustainable growth in major European infrastructure projects, through the creation of Eurobonds. I should like to finish by stressing how important it is, to my mind, that we have reached a satisfactory compromise on the key issues of being able to guarantee social rights in the different legislations of the Single Market and of protecting services of general interest within the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon. Commissioner, we are sending you a very clear message: the economy must be at the service of the citizens, and not the other way round. You need our help. Today, we give you this help, along with a major challenge: that of reconciling our citizens with the European project. So do not let us down and give them the confidence they need!

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mrs Gebhardt, for their work. The Commission’s initial proposal was indeed absurd, as it endangered the level of consumer protection by wanting to harmonise it completely. This is only justifiable so long as harmonisation is upwards and not downwards, as proposed. Therefore I welcome most of the compromises reached, which leave the possibility for Member States to apply stricter rules if they so wish, while guaranteeing a high minimum level for all consumers in the Union. Thus, maximum contract duration is limited to 12 months, information on distance contracts or telesales contracts is improved, with payment being required only when the cooling-off period, set at 14 days, has expired. On the other hand, it is unacceptable to keep full harmonisation regarding chapter V, relating to unfair terms. Not only is the chosen level of protection unsatisfactory, it is also tantamount to ignoring the reality of fraudulent practices, since these require a level of responsiveness that European legislation cannot offer. That being the case, taking away all room for manoeuvre from Member States in this area seems like an irresponsible move. Consequently I hope that the colegislators manage to come up with a balanced text which guarantees a genuine and common core of high-level protection. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 Having been rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament on the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I am delighted with the text that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has adopted, which contains many of the proposals we and other associated committees made. In this respect, I think Edite Estrela’s report is excellent, as it places the emphasis on some of the crucial aspects of our European social and healthcare model: equality of access to high quality healthcare for everyone in Europe, better management of reproductive health, monitoring of the efficacy and quality of drugs through independent pharmacovigilance systems and, above all, the necessity of high levels of public funding for healthcare during this period of economic crisis. Health is not a general good like other goods, and our welfare systems have the duty to ensure that the most disadvantaged have access to healthcare. I am naturally astounded therefore at the votes to remove some of the abovementioned points requested by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group. This step smacks of reactionary neoliberalism, and I hope that the final vote will preserve the spirit of this report and be a credit to this Parliament. Bernadette Vergnaud,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Services Directive was the subject of unprecedented public political debate when it was being discussed in Parliament. Thanks to the efforts to reach a compromise, which were led by Mrs Gebhardt, whom I congratulate, the text that Parliament succeeded in adopting in 2006 was one that reconciled the need to stimulate the internal market in services as a source of potential growth and job creation, and respect for social rights, labour law and the specific nature of services of general interest. In order to maintain this very fragile balance, the directive had to be transposed with the utmost care. This caused problems for many Member States, such as difficulties in implementing the points of single contact and the mutual evaluation process. Right now, I am concerned about and question the choice made by France; it is very much a minority choice and will result in provisions being split up between a whole series of laws and decrees. I also regret the very restrictive interpretation of the concept of authorising the provision of services. It will create legal uncertainty for social services relating to the care of young children and the disabled, even though derogation and exclusion possibilities were provided for in the directive. Parliament is playing, and will continue to play, a full part in monitoring the successful implementation of this directive, which is key to ensuring that the single market creates jobs and is closer to the citizens, and that Europe is experienced on a daily basis as something positive, not something negative. I therefore call on the Member States and the Commission to step up their efforts to guarantee a completely transparent process for European citizens.

Compared to the Commission’s initial proposal, which facilitated patient mobility with a market-oriented perspective on health, I welcome the progress reflected in this agreement. It was essential in order to safeguard our social protection systems that we re-establish a prior authorisation system for hospital or cost-intensive treatment. Similarly, the reference to Article 168 of the Treaty was necessary in order to ensure that the prerogatives of the Member States in terms of organising their public health systems were respected. Finally, commendable progress has been made in terms of cooperation and patient information. There are, however, still major deficiencies: the lack of consideration given to the mobility of professionals, medical demography and the ageing population. Other legislative proposals should remedy this – in particular, the proposal regarding professional qualifications – and in those proposals, it will be important to reaffirm that health is a sector with specific characteristics and not a commodity governed solely by the laws of the market, but rather the most precious asset that citizens have.

 The adoption today in plenary of a budgetary amendment to mobilise the EU Solidarity Fund to the tune of EUR 35.6 million following a proposal by the Commission is good news. This is in response to the request made by the French Government following storm Xynthia, which hit the French coast on 27 and 28 February 2010, leaving 53 people dead and 80 injured in Vendée and Charente-Maritime. The procedure is undoubtedly long and in need of improvement, but I am pleased to see European solidarity being shown in this way, in the face of the tragedy the victims have experienced. I had written to Commissioner Hahn to support the French Government’s request for aid, and he has honoured the commitment he made to me during his visit to La Rochelle in early March. This fund is more than much-needed financial assistance; it symbolises the common values shared by our continent. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by pointing out that I did not believe it right to give our opinion so early on with a vote on the events that took place in Laâyoune on 8 November, when we do not have all the facts at our disposal to give us the necessary hindsight and objectivity. Nevertheless, given these conditions, I am relieved to see that we have reached a relatively balanced and measured joint resolution which takes into account the concept of human rights and which does not unduly condemn either party, even though some points are questionable. In any case, the most important thing I think is not to inflame the situation further so that investigations and negotiations can be conducted in an atmosphere of calm, and so I think it wise not to be drawn into challenging the privileged status of a neighbouring partner country on the basis of partial and often contradictory reports.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a few months after Professor Monti’s report, which called for a necessary recovery of the citizen-oriented internal market, I welcome the Commission’s response. What particularly stands out in my mind is the improved recognition of professional qualifications, aid for SMEs, the new legislation on public contracts and service concessions, and legal certainty for the social economy. I therefore welcome this ambition. However, I regret that, in the 50 proposals, there is no clear definition of priorities. I am worried about the piecemeal strategy of the various Directorates-General and Commissioners and call on Mr Barroso to become more involved in order to avoid contradictory proposals. Finally, I deplore the absence of any real commitment on services of general interest given that, for years, we have been asking for protective legislation, which is now possible under the Treaty of Lisbon. For that reason, Mr Barnier, I am waiting to see the final texts before making my mind up and possibly supporting you in this major challenge for the future of Europe and of all its citizens.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Weiler, on her work and the remarkable compromise achieved with the Council, as the Commission’s initial proposal had some major faults. I would like to go back over four important points achieved in this directive. First, I am very pleased that there is a guarantee in place on equal treatment of the public and private sectors. The Commission was expecting heavier sanctions for the public sector, even though the latter works in the general interest. This was the result of ignorance about the reality of the state of the Member States’ public accounts, and could have resulted in a competitive disadvantage for public companies. Another move forward is the extension of payment terms to 60 instead of 30 days for public health services, which have complex budgetary procedures forcing them to have longer payment terms, for which they cannot be held responsible. Still on the subject of payment terms, it was essential to establish a ban on unfair contractual terms affecting creditors in contracts between companies, which often happens between a large group and a small and medium-sized enterprise. Finally, and this relates primarily to the small and medium-sized enterprises which are victims of payment delays, the introduction of an 8% interest rate in the event of a delay and compensation to cover collection costs could encourage these companies to demand damages. Until now, they have tended to refuse to do so at the risk of this jeopardising anything. I am therefore delighted to be able to vote on this bill which, I hope, will constitute real progress for the viability and good health of European businesses, progress that is needed not only for a more successful internal market, but also a fairer one. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, pharmacovigilance, which involves analysing the side effects of medicinal products and calling for their withdrawal from the market in the event of an alert, incited little interest in the midst of the pharmaceutical package. It is, however, essential to the safety and quality of our health systems and, even though I am delighted to see you, Commissioner, I must deplore Mr Dalli’s absence. I was dismayed by the Commission’s proposals, which jeopardised the pharmacovigilance systems for the benefit of the pharmaceutical companies. Fortunately, thanks to the work of Parliament and the Council, the situation has been improved somewhat. Thus, it will not be possible to generalise advance marketing authorisations for new medicinal products. We can also be pleased with the progress made in terms of transparency. However, I think that this agreement represents a missed opportunity to improve pharmacovigilance and I am concerned, above all, at the lack of guarantees regarding the independence of the system. Thus, even though the role of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee has been strengthened, it is not totally independent of the European committee which grants the marketing authorisation. We know from experience that this committee is loath to go back on its decisions. As for national structures, there is absolutely no provision on the matter. Also, I am sorry that the Member States do not have to report possible conflicts of interest of experts on the European committee. Finally, and this is the most serious point, this agreement endorses the end of the best guarantee of independence: public funding for pharmacovigilance activities, most of which will be funded in future by private fees. I congratulate Mrs McAvan on having improved the Commission’s initial proposal but, as there are a number of problematic issues, I question the point of closing this dossier in a single reading. If we had taken our time, we could have increased patients’ confidence in safe, high quality pharmaceutical products. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

I condemn the ostrich politics of those who think that the European Court of Justice’s current case-law on service concessions is satisfactory and that there is absolutely no need to legislate. For years, the socialists have fought and campaigned to obtain framework directives protecting services of general interest, and there is no question of us abandoning this commitment. The only long-term guarantee for public services is real European legislation, not judicial decisions, however well-founded they may be. As we can see with the difficulties in transposing the Services Directive in relation to social services, only a specific framework can provide legal certainty and quality of service. Small and medium-sized enterprises and local and regional authorities expect clarity and legal certainty in the awarding of public procurement contracts such as social housing public procurement contracts. However, neither did we want to vote against this report, which contains important elements, in particular, as regards social and environmental standards, which we must be able to integrate into tender procedures, recommendations to facilitate SME access, and a clear call for vigilance in public-private partnership contracts.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by expressing my deepest sympathy and solidarity with the victims of the Madeira floods and of storm Xynthia. The necessary questions must be asked about the worrying increase in these destructive meteorological phenomena, and about the role played by climate change and the urgent need to find solutions. For now, it is a case of providing urgent solutions to the populations rocked by these disasters. Of course, public and private insurance providers must be responsive but, when it comes to the destroyed infrastructure and rebuilding the areas concerned, European solidarity must be expressed. That is why the French Government has requested aid from the EU Solidarity Fund, created in 2002, which I hope will be granted quickly and meaningfully. This is the thrust of the two letters that I have sent to the Commission since 1 March in my capacity as an elected representative for the west of France region and which I had the opportunity to discuss, last Thursday, in La Rochelle, with Commissioner Hahn, whom I sincerely thank for being so responsive. Commissioner Hahn agreed that the mechanism was complex and difficult to implement. Well, we have to conclude that it could have been made more flexible if the Council had not incomprehensibly blocked the review of the operation of this fund as adopted by a very large majority of MEPs in May 2006. I therefore hope that the Spanish Presidency will break the deadlock on this text so that the system can be made more effective. In more immediate terms, I call on the Commission to authorise a one­off increase in cofinancing via the ERDF and ESF regional funds for projects in the regions affected, within a time frame that will enable their economies to recover by summer. Lastly, this aid should not be used to rebuild in such a way that the same tragic environmental and town planning mistakes are made; rather, it should be used in a considered way, so as to prevent as far as possible a repeat of such tragedies.

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have the opportunity to mention during a priority debate these three reports concerning citizens’ everyday lives. I would like, moreover, to congratulate our rapporteurs on their work and, more specifically, to mention the SOLVIT network. The network has now been in existence for eight years; it has resolved many problems effectively and yet it is completely unknown. How many times have I had to refer people to this network, the existence of which they did not even suspect, even though this tool could strengthen the image of a Europe protective of its citizens’ rights. I must admit – and I am very glad that Mr Barnier is here – that I understand that my country’s government does not really promote it. The increased number of cases would consequently be very tricky to manage for the sole trainee who, currently in 2010, is in charge of the SOLVIT network in France, a country which, it is true, has only 60 million inhabitants and which is only the second Member State in the EU from the point of view of the number of cases submitted in 2009. Indeed, the resolution rate is amazingly good, but the time periods are dreadful, with an average of 15 weeks before cases are dealt with, which is five weeks beyond the maximum allowed. I would therefore ask the Commission and the Member States to grant real financial and human resources and to conduct major information campaigns, aimed especially at businesses, which submitted no more cases in 2009 than in 2004.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have already discussed the fears linked to the transposition of the Services Directive. In this sense, the example of the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications is symbolic. Some States have failed to respect the transposition deadline and are having problems due to the gaps in the text. Although this directive lays a solid foundation for mutual recognition, the specific characteristics of certain professions have not been taken into account. The fact is, recognising qualifications without having established actual common levels of qualification and training, including for higher education, can only cause complications and create mistrust on the part of Member States, professionals and the citizens. The most obvious example is that of the medical professions. For example, French midwives are authorised to write prescriptions and are trained for that, which is not the case in other countries. What happens when a midwife without such authorisation arrives in France without additional training and has to write a medical prescription? Similarly, certain specialisms do not exist in every Member State. This directive is crucial to the free movement of workers, the foundation on which the European project is based, but it must be improved and enhanced, and the difficulties encountered must serve to identify the professions for which language teaching and harmonised training are necessary. I should like to mention the remarkable initiative, which is supported by all health professionals, to create a European card. This is a genuine guarantee as much for the carrier as for the customer or patient, and I call on the Commission to extend it to other professions, since this will enable us to improve mutual recognition and to gain the citizens’ trust.

 I am delighted to see this lengthy, highly controversial work reach its conclusion; it shows the importance of the telecommunications sector not only as an economic player but also as a vital element in today’s society. Our citizens communicate across borders on a daily basis and our aim was to guarantee quality of services while ensuring that users’ fundamental rights were respected. I want to congratulate Mrs Trautmann and the negotiating team for the compromise they have achieved, making any sanctions taken against users subject to a prior contradictory procedure. Furthermore, the Commission was committed to guaranteeing net neutrality and to combating anti-competitive, discriminatory practices carried out by operators. This agreement will mean consumers benefit from many positive developments which were sometimes the result of tough negotiations. I particularly wish to highlight guaranteed access and localisation for calls made to the emergency number (112); improved access for the disabled; greater information on contracts and billing; warnings in cases of unusually high usage; the introduction of a maximum delay when transferring a customer’s telephone number; and information in cases of security breaches relating to personal data.

Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since its adoption and the heated debates that surrounded it, the Services Directive has somewhat faded into obscurity, but it is important to show that we are particularly vigilant in the crucial phase of its transposition. I question the interpretation of the provisions of Article 2 of the directive linked to the exclusion of social services from its scope. Notions such as ‘support for persons in need’ and ‘mandated providers’ seem restrictive when compared with the definition of social services used in certain Member States, and I am concerned that a deliberately strict interpretation may serve to justify the inclusion of whole swathes of these services in the scope of the directive. The exclusion of these services is a key element of the text and a guarantee for the citizens that the European social model will be protected. I hope that certain Member States, including France, will not take advantage of the transposition in order to liberalise social services, under the false pretext that they are complying with European laws. These problems to do with the integration of services of general interest demonstrate the need to have European legislation that is specific to them and not to stick to a default definition as part of a directive on commercial services. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

I voted against Mr Barroso’s candidacy, above all, because I believe in a genuinely political Europe, which cannot be satisfied with a Commission bound by the desiderata of big business. I also believe that one cannot campaign by calling for another form of European leadership only to then give a blank cheque to a champion of liberalism whose programme is sorely lacking in ambition and values. A man who has taken shelter behind the idea of ‘better regulation’ in order to ‘deregulate’ everything that I, as a socialist, defend: public services, social protection of workers, respect for health systems, regulation of the financial economy and protection of consumers and of the environment against the power of industrial groups. Out of respect for my own convictions and those of the electorate, I feel that these values cannot be called into question by ulterior motives and tricks aimed at obtaining derisory concessions from conservatives who control the majority of the Member States, the European Parliament and the Commission, and who will not rest until they have furthered their deregulatory policy.

Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, this summer our Member States reached an agreement on a growth pact. In the autumn, they are foolishly unable to agree on the resources for it. Budgetary discipline is one thing, but it is the citizens who are paying the price of the crisis because of the loss of jobs. They are waiting for policies that promote economic recovery, reinvigorate the internal market and ensure greater solidarity. That is why, like other Members – and I say this straight away to President Barroso – we cannot accept the Commission’s proposal as a ceiling; it is the absolute lowest level to which the European Parliament could sink. The proposals of the Cypriot Presidency, like those of Mr Van Rompuy, are just not enough. They are not enough to enable us to achieve a balance that encourages regional development and regional fairness, between the agriculture and Cohesion Fund policies, for example. They are not enough for a number of activities that guarantee the European Union’s competitiveness, such as industrial policy, research and the Connecting Europe Facility. They are not enough to offer guarantees for young people, access to training, Erasmus funding, or consideration of all young people for lifelong learning, as well as lifelong learning for other groups, such as adults and older people. As Mr Barroso said, that is the fifth freedom. Finally, there are no longer any resources for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund or food aid for the most deprived. Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore ask you to make a real investment in infrastructure, in the economy, and in the future of our young people. Catherine Trautmann,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets
. − Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, among the numerous challenges that the introduction of the European Semester presents, I would like to mention two key aspects. First of all, this mechanism must not simply be an instrument for formal surveillance of budgetary policies between Member States and by the Commission. On the contrary, the European Semester must allow sincere and in-depth collaboration between the European Parliament and national parliaments, in keeping with our respective competences and the democratic principle. It is the only valid way forward with a view to complementarity of national budgetary policies. Secondly, with regard to the European budget: our Parliament, by a massive vote in favour of the Kalfin and Böge report, pointed out that 94 % of this budget was an investment budget. On that basis, I proposed, in my opinion included in the report, exploring the possibility of excluding Member States’ contributions to the EU budget from the calculation of the structural deficit, as defined in the two-pack, the six-pack and the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (TSCG). Our Parliament is conducting the mother of all battles, for a European budget that meets the overall interests of the EU and its citizens. That is the direction of this proposal, addressed both to net contributory and beneficiary States. It would free up budget negotiation. In fact, it would make it possible to leave behind the damaging logic of fair return and the search for rebates and move to an approach based on contribution in the noblest sense of the term. In addition, such a calculation method would make the most of all payments to our common budget, including those made by beneficiaries. Consequently, I ask Mr Gauzès, our rapporteur, to look again at his request, on behalf of the PPE, to remove this proposal. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, Mr Barroso, I think the State of the Union, for us members, is the State of Europeans. Europeans are troubled by three things: financial matters, health and employment. I would have liked to have talked about protecting people’s savings. I would have liked more ambition on the issue of re-equipping our industries through energy, the environment and digital technology. I would also have liked you to show a little more insight. If we are actually going to get out of this crisis, we need a timetable that is appropriate for the efforts of Member States and citizens. I would add, in this respect, that there is no democratic progress without social rights and, on a social level, as some have said, it is still not good enough. We need guarantees in terms of employment, in terms of not attacking the European social model as well as guarantees in terms of the financial and fiscal effort of all those who elect us and who want to regain confidence in the European Union. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).  
– (FR) 
Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, the decision taken in Brussels is a welcome breath of fresh air, and even if there remains a lot to do, the conclusions of this summit mark the end of an era and represent the first stage of a revival for our citizens, that of a Europe that gives itself the means to be fairer and show more solidarity. The issue of growth is no longer taboo and the discussion about the broad economic guidelines is now under way. The European Union will not be able to emerge from the rut of the crisis without breaking the vicious circle of austerity, which could condemn Member States to an endless recession. I am delighted that this sound political sense can at last be found in the conclusions and I am glad that France and its President, Mr Hollande, have contributed to this political rebalancing and are committed, out of solidarity, to the path of integration. However, although hope is essential, full implementation is what will restore confidence permanently. With EUR 120 billion having been mobilised within the framework of the Growth and Employment Pact, and EUR 10 billion of recapitalisation from the European Investment Bank (EIB), these will allow bonds to be issued for the purpose of financing projects. The European Parliament must be heard concerning a coherent financial framework and own resources. The mobilisation of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the launch of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which we would have liked to see granted a banking licence, is the most urgent matter for Spain and Italy, without forgetting the Greek citizens who have been hit hard by the crisis. The quick implementation of a banking supervisor for the euro area is only the first step towards banking union, which Parliament strongly advocates. Moreover, we cannot content ourselves with a limited tax on financial transactions, even if its implementation within the framework of enhanced cooperation could constitute a first step. In this way, we expect a lot from the next European Council, where the group of four – four Presidents, of course – will have to propose an ambitious road map in order to advance economic and monetary union and to enable the definitive resolution of the sovereign debt crisis and the instability of the euro area. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to give our fellow citizens concrete proof of our capacity to resolve the crisis, first and foremost, through growth fuelled by investment. Can you justify, in these times of precarious employment, doing away with the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), which is supposed to support workers who have lost their jobs because of globalisation, especially when we have to reinvent an industrial policy for Europe? Solidarity and insecurity are affecting a new population of young people, unemployed workers, women and pensioners. Yet those same people who were unable to manage this crisis would choose to do away with the European food distribution programme? Mr President, I ask that it be maintained beyond 2013, without doing away with any other essential programmes. The last aspect is cohesion. The regions must not be held responsible for the poor management of the Member States. We reject the strengthening of macro-economic conditionality because, in a time of crisis, we need to be able to adjust the support policies where economic growth is regional and where jobs can be provided. We therefore stand alongside the trade unions and NGOs that are fighting for solidarity, and alongside the regions, which must play a key role in the vitality of the territories in order to promote more growth, employment and social justice. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, Greece has been forced into an endless spiral of austerity and today, these modern-day doctors Diafoirus, these advocates of blood-letting, are refusing to deliver the aid promised. How do we explain this to the Greek citizens who are being doubly punished with pressure and injustice? There are alternative approaches. Let me propose one: the fight against tax avoidance. The tax haven provided by Switzerland costs Greece an estimated EUR 16.4 billion in loss of earnings. Tackling this resolutely would enable Greece to get back on track with the stability pact without sacrificing the future. Greece has been pushed by circumstances into considering a bilateral agreement with Switzerland, similar to the Rubik agreements signed by the United Kingdom and Germany. Executing this partial levy on fraudulent investments, instead of prosecuting fraudsters, is institutional recognition of tax fraud and a bad deal financially. The Union should follow the example of the United States, which has successfully forced Switzerland to provide the bank details of suspected fraudsters. What are the Commission’s plans now that its services have concluded the illegality of these agreements in a note that I believe should be made public? What does it suggest for the future now that its proposed Savings Tax Directive has been buried by the Council and, in particular, by Germany? In short, what does it intend to propose so as to stop constantly penalising the poor? I would like it if the Commissioner could respond because this question is important, but I can see that he has not been listening. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, I am not going to give in to politicking – I want to assure Mr Reul of that – because I believe that this treaty is setting us up for failure and I deeply regret it. I regret it because it is inefficient in its response to the market in the face of the crisis as it does not rebuild confidence. We have seen the problems Greece and Portugal have had in the same period. We are seeing two countries, who are the greatest contributors to our budget, France and Germany, whose growth rates have been halved. We understand that it is the wording of this treaty which, normally, should have served to settle things and reassure everyone, including the people. In reality, it is the action of the ECB which has had a positive effect, by making over EUR 500 billion of liquidities available to the banks. However, in Parliament, we must realise that we have to be consistent. We are elected by our voters; and our voters are the retired people who are in debt, the workers who marched through the streets of Brussels, the unemployed people waiting for work, and the young people who want to have a future. We cannot content ourselves with criticising a treaty which is based solely on fiscal discipline, on penalties, and which, even worse, introduces government by the judiciary to the detriment of the sovereignty of national parliaments. We, the Members of the European Parliament, should rise up against this outcome and put forward proposals. I, for one, have proposals that I should like to put forward. This is not simply about criticising. I believe, Mr President, that what we can propose today for Europe is a virtuous circle, a European pact of responsibility, governance and growth. This treaty must be renegotiated, on a basis which allows for true coordination of economic policies, including industrial projects to provide work for our factories and our workers, projects in the fields of energy and the environment, the creation of Eurobonds, which have regrettably been forgotten about or crossed off the agenda, and financial regulation. We need justice, we need solidarity. That is what we must defend in Parliament. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, the cheers that accompanied this agreement have already stopped. Is anyone surprised? The package offers no immediate solution to the crisis: no pooling of debt via Eurobonds – even though they have Mr Van Rompuy’s backing – and no strengthening of the European Financial Stability Facility or provision of a banking licence to enable it to raise funds via the ECB, which will not intervene in sovereign debt matters. What happened to using the tax on financial transactions as a fair taxation tool and an own resource? Perhaps there is no longer any urgency. After all, Mr Sarkozy, having pushed through two austerity plans in order to maintain France’s AAA rating, declared yesterday that a rating downgrade was not such a big obstacle to overcome. Who are they trying to kid? In the longer term, this agreement will be one of sanctions and fear, and it will put a little more pressure on the Member States, which are already struggling. The austerity policies decreed by ‘Merkozy’ are set to plunge Europe back into recession, and Europeans into unemployment. Where is the solidarity? Where are the jobs and growth? Europe is not a poor Union, but it needs to revitalise its industry, develop its infrastructure and offer its young people prospects for the future. This requires investment, which the Member States and the Union should be helped to finance. This is what justifies revising this Treaty. Any other decision would mean bypassing the national parliaments and the European Parliament and would thus be undemocratic. How can one explain the fact that a future French presidential candidate consulted neither the opposition parties nor his parliament before pledging his country’s signature? That is something that no one can understand or accept. Catherine Trautmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, during the negotiations on the telecoms package, the European Parliament already advocated the need to respect the Internet’s neutrality. Transparency on how traffic is managed in times of network overload and a minimum quality of service are basic requirements, but the persistent blocking of Internet content, as was just mentioned, or applications shows that these requirements are not enough. Let us therefore remember the essential nature of the Internet for fundamental rights and media pluralism and the need to ensure the confidentiality of communications and people’s private lives. Telecoms operators can contribute to economic recovery. They must be given the opportunity to innovate and invest in the development of new services, but the quality of basic Internet services, with which we are familiar, must not under any circumstances be allowed to decline in favour of paid services. We oppose the creation of a two-speed Internet which would be discriminatory for the most modest-income households, who are already hard-hit by the crisis. Finally, if the findings of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) require it, we would ask the Commission to assume its responsibilities and produce a binding text which ensures the Internet’s neutrality. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, our colleague who has just spoken is right. We need networks, we need an economic development model which gives us a future in every sector. Let us take the case of youth employment. There is no way we can believe in the future and trust policies when youth unemployment is over 15% or 20% and when young people are even denied a first job. I was disappointed by what Mr Barroso had to say. I would have liked practical solutions, for instance, priority access to public procurement for companies that hire young people for their first job. I would have also liked the Commission to present a tailored strategy for development. Yes, we have regions in Europe that are worse off than others. Yes, we have pockets of poverty and, with that in mind, we found out that one Head of State was calling into question the sustainability of the funding for the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union (PEAD). If there is no future for young people, if there is no solution for the most deprived, if there is no development strategy, you have enough resources to carry out social impact assessments, sector by sector, to determine where jobs can be created in companies, industry and services. It is not enough to say or claim that we could guarantee job security; we must ensure that the young and unemployed can access qualified jobs that enable them to find a solution, since without a job, there is no social dignity. How much progress has the Commission made on the Posting of Workers Directive, Commissioner? We have been waiting a long time for the divide between our countries concerning human resources and employees to be removed. I would like and hope to receive specific answers from you and I shall conclude by saying that I am disappointed that Mr Barroso only devoted one hour to a year-long programme that is meant to bring about a sustainable recovery and a permanent resolution to our Member States’ sovereign debt. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, this morning my feelings are both of relief and concern. I feel relieved because at least last night’s agreement exists as we could not risk another failure. The restructuring of the Greek debt takes the European contribution to more than EUR 200 billion, adding together private debts, the euro area stability fund and the public aid plan. The first stage of recapitalising the banks loosens the current stranglehold by increasing own funds. I particularly welcome the increase of the European Financial Stability Facility rescue fund to EUR 1 000 billion, at last, in my view, as the socialists have always believed that this fund was not sufficiently resourced. However, as a European, let me share with you the reasons for my concern, which are serious ones. I fear that all we did last night was to increase our capacity to carry out a patch-up job, and that we neglected the foundations of our common edifice. On reading this agreement, I can see grounds for two major reservations: firstly, its ‘short term’ nature. The measures adopted this morning relate exclusively to finance and in no way provide a long-term solution to the need for economic integration. This morning, the Council responded to the European banking, debt and euro crisis: that was a vital step. However, the lack of prospects for growth and the silence on economic convergence and employment allow some people to continue to speculate about how fragile we are. At a time when we should be carrying out structural reforms to invest in and kick-start growth, we are recommended to opt for the ‘Euro Plus Pact’. We do not accept that. Let us not replace excessive dependency on the market by dependency on competitor nations which do not comply either with social or environmental standards. The second reservation: budgetary authoritarianism, which adds enforcement to austerity. In point of fact, we face two crucial tasks today: to clean up our public finances and to kick-start growth. The balance between these two must be a political choice. It flows from a decision that we make for the people of Europe that we represent. The Court of Justice should not be a substitute for political will and our duty to show solidarity. We must not revise the treaty under pressure from speculators. The choice of further integration is our political duty, and that of this Parliament. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission needs to prove today that the industrial policy it stands for is not an empty promise. As has already been said, we cannot accept that economically viable sites equipped with high-performance tools and skilled employees may be shut down because of a cynical calculation of profits. As far as the Florange site is concerned, I call on the Commission to speed up its selection process for the NER 300 programme, because we must examine all the other options for maintaining activity on European soil. Indeed, this site brings together, under the Ultra-Low Carbon dioxide (CO2
) Steelmaking (ULCOS) programme, all the elements needed to set up a pilot project in the field of CO2
 capture and storage, thereby striking a difficult balance between heavy industry and environmental protection. The fact is, the more blast furnaces are shut down for the long term, the more it will cost to start them back up again, and the greater the risk of this project failing, which would be catastrophic not only for the Lorraine steelmaking area but also, on a wider scale, for all the regions in Europe that are interested in reproducing this kind of equipment. The European Union was born out of steel and steelmaking. We cannot let it disintegrate and perish because of a financial crisis and because of the demise of steelmaking, for the sake of our jobs, our regions and our workers. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Madam President, Commissioner, unlike the French Government, I sincerely hope we will have a major public debate. We need comprehensive stress tests. Fukushima has shown that we must imagine the unimaginable. The method currently used fails to take into account risks such as terrorist attacks or plane crashes, and therefore does not meet this requirement. We need a transparent debate, because the choice whether to continue or stop must be based on broad public consensus that is informed but not bypassed by expert discussions. We need an independent debate in the presence of all parties, so as to avoid potential conflicts of interest and promote appeasement. Finally, I am from Alsace and therefore know the extent to which the Fessenheim nuclear power plant concerns our German and Swiss neighbours. Instead of establishing full national control over these issues, why not at least encourage a sharing of expertise between our security agencies? Security would benefit, as would transparency and citizenship at European level. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this very fine report by our fellow Member, Mr Audy, summarises all our discussions with the operators in the sector. I am not going to go over their assessment of our Seventh Framework Programme: that it is indispensable but too complicated and too bureaucratic. I would just like to emphasise two points. Firstly, innovation. Parliament has pledged to promote it, but it must not do so at the expense of fundamental research. As we well know, the main result of research is knowledge, followed by the opportunity to enhance that result in the economic sector, or indeed the industrial sector. A clear distinction must be made, then, between the manipulation and the enhancement of fundamental research. Secondly, financing. We all agree that the budget should match our ambitions. I would go so far as to say that, on this issue, we should be innovative by being consistent. It is pointless bringing in more instruments; let us make the existing ones more effective. In this respect, the risk-sharing finance facility is a real success, but it must take a more inclusive approach to SMEs and research infrastructure. I therefore call on the Commission to do everything in its power to solve the disputes as quickly as possible and to take into account the courses of action proposed in this report. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).  
– (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we set ourselves the objective of strengthening our capacity for innovation and investment or the competitive advantage to be found with the United States and China, we speak of economic development, certainly, but specifically, we also speak of creating jobs. For that reason, we must give ourselves the means to strengthen innovation. I would like to congratulate Mrs Merkies on the one-stop shop, the funding strategy, and the recognition of necessary risk-taking by researchers. Her report points in the right direction and proposes a context that is favourable to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are essential to the success of the European Union. Innovation means attractiveness and competitiveness of the territories, and the involvement of the regional and local authorities is essential in terms of committing appropriations, reducing disparities and enhancing the active role that citizens must play. It is directly on the ground that the measure proposed in this report will contribute effectively to the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives. Catherine Trautmann,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fishermen have told us that it is becoming harder for them to make a living from their work. On top of the particularly painful situation for them of a reduction in fishing quotas and plans for exit from the fleet, there is now the added problem of soaring oil prices. Although the price has fallen slightly, it continues to fluctuate, and for two years now, this situation has been affecting the daily lives of all our European fishermen, in particular, in the small-scale and coastal fishing sector. This situation is extremely worrying, and we are anxious to show fishermen that we are fully behind them. To do so, we call on the European Commission to raise the threshold of de minimis
 aid that can be granted to them to help them cope with this crisis. This is simply a temporary measure, justified by an urgent situation. The Commission already reacted to a similar phenomenon in 2007, and in the face of this new peak, we wish to know what concrete measures – you have already given details of some of them – it intends to take. We also feel it is crucial, as Mrs Fraga Estévez said, to verify that the Member States are using all of the funds currently set aside by the regulation. At a time when the future common fisheries policy appears to be taking shape, I believe that our fishermen are not resistant to change; quite the contrary. Many of them told me that they were willing to make an effort, particularly in terms of preserving stocks. This is, in fact, a collective responsibility. In order to make that effort, they must not fall victim to factors outside their work over which they have absolutely no control. A swift and effective response by you, Commissioner, on this point would send a signal that would also help strengthen what we know are historically fragile links between the Commission and the profession. Catherine Trautmann,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to give our verdict at first reading on the draft radio spectrum policy programme, and I should like to thank the Commission for having supported and transformed this proposal, which was first tabled during our debates on the telecoms package. I should also like to commend our rapporteur, Mr Hökmark, as well as my fellow shadow rapporteurs, for our good cooperation on a report which reveals some major political issues hidden behind its highly technical aspects. We have had numerous debates, which have really made me see that Parliament and the Commission do, quite naturally, share the same opinion and ambition. The opinion is that spectrum is a scarce resource that does not recognise borders. Everyone seems to agree on this point. However, it is on the solutions to be found to improve its management and on the general ambition that some differences can be observed, in particular with the Member States, which I do not deny have historically had a certain sovereign responsibility. Although not all the compromises tabled and adopted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy are as balanced as I personally would have liked, I support very sincerely the general move to develop a spectrum management approach that is more integrated, realistic and responsive to the social, cultural and economic needs of our fellow citizens. This is a common thread in all the positions adopted by our Parliament, Commissioner, be it on the own-initiative report by my colleague, Mrs Toia, or on the proposals that I myself defended as one of the rapporteurs for the telecoms package. With regard to the radio spectrum policy programme, my group and I placed particular emphasis on several points in our amendments. They include, therefore, introducing transparency so as to learn how spectrum is currently allocated and managed – that is, the inventory principle – and also finding innovative and original solutions to the electronic communications sector’s growing demand for use of frequencies. They need to be qualitative, not just quantitative, solutions. By emphasising spectral efficiency, we will remedy this situation without limiting the diversity of services available on the spectrum. In doing so, we are also using spectrum as a vehicle for bridging the digital divide and developing new services that are within the reach not only of large telecommunications companies but also of SMEs and start-ups, which will need them. I believe that this economic dimension is essential. To conclude, I should like to say a few words about the next stage. As you said yourself, it was clear from the start that a first-reading agreement was out of the question, but it is imperative that we reach an agreement by the end of the year. This is essential for our public services, for meeting consumers’ expectations, and for developing the Internet regardless of the infrastructure in place. It is also essential for planning the economic recovery of our European Union thanks to this resource. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, nuclear power is a non-carbon energy source, but also a transitional energy source which depends on exhaustible resources. It is also a potentially dangerous form of energy. The obvious priority, after Fukushima, is to take a view on the safety of our power stations. These stress tests must be carried out in the most coordinated way possible at Union level, and potentially beyond in our immediate neighbourhood, by independent entities working in accordance with the strictest standards and with the greatest transparency. Next, the fight against climate change requires a coherent and ambitious policy. While nuclear power means that we can emit less CO2
 into the atmosphere to produce the electricity we need, we must not be dependent on it. In countries such as France which produce nuclear power, reducing its share is a precondition for any far-reaching decision. This process means that we must redouble our efforts when it comes to saving energy and increasing the share of renewables, which, in the medium and long-term, will be able to cover almost all of our consumption. This is about the safety of power stations, but it must also be about the security of provision throughout the European Union, so that no country finds itself in economic difficulty. Finally, true solidarity requires the creation of an Energy Community. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, I thank my fellow Member, Mr Rübig, for asking this question. I think that, actually, the French regulator is independent – his proposals are testament to that. I think that, given the logic of what I mentioned concerning the European Energy Community, we should have an independent regulator at European level and make available the supervisory means to ensure that the regulator’s work is independent and that the regulator is genuinely competent. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Mr President, at national level, it is always possible to question the composition and, from this point of view, I agree with Mrs Lepage’s comment. I think that we will soon see a period in which pluralism can be better ensured, but in any case, I would not want to question the honesty of the work by those people who have taken up their task conscientiously, and one person in particular, Mr Lacoste. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, I would like to thank Bernd Lange for his excellent work. Tomorrow, his collaborative method will be crowned with success. Moreover, Commissioner, this is an opportunity for the Commission, which provided us with a rather disappointing communication. As someone who hails from a large region heavily hit by the crisis, when it had already been affected by industrial restructuring, I have listened to the message of the unions, which have constantly challenged us. We need an industrial policy, all of whose components work towards the same goal: constructing a strategy that is based on sustainable, employment-centred growth that is built around the optimisation of skills and which shows that social and technological innovations are compatible with each other. That is the key to European competitiveness and not the use of the workforce as an adjustment variable, as the Commission proposed in the European semester. The best move the Commission could make is to rapidly integrate the Posting of Workers Directive into the work programme and to begin fiscal harmonisation starting with corporate taxation. Furthermore, this policy should take shape not only at national and European level, but also at local level in the context of an effective cohesion policy. Our choice is a regulated financial market, and we share the desire to consolidate the single market, but not at the expense of an inequitable labour market which is subject to social dumping. Today, Madam President, we are debating an ambitious industrial policy, and this morning, we voted on a tax on financial transactions, and on Eurobonds. Ladies and gentlemen, we must use these means to finance it. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment which is currently being examined by the Lithuanian Parliament and which would make it a punishable offence to publicly promote homosexuality, was drafted within the framework of a law for the protection of minors against the detrimental effects of public information. How can we, supposedly for the sake of protecting minors, undermine both freedom of expression and of information, and, above all, sanction discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation? We know very well that a text of this kind leads to concealing one’s sexual orientation and runs counter to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) rights which we have defended and which this Parliament has defended. Furthermore, at a time when we are witnessing acts of violence and aggression towards homosexuals, this is an incitement to criminalising homosexuality and a call for violence. We cannot give to young people an image of Europe as a society that is closed, intolerant, inward-looking and that disregards respect for other people. For us, therefore, this law is in complete contradiction with European values, as contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. As has been said, it also goes against the whole antidiscriminatory corpus of Union law, which has greatly contributed to making our national laws more egalitarian in many aspects of everyday life from employment to information or education. I thank you, Commissioner, for making a very clear statement, and I would like all groups to understand your argument as well as that of my fellow Members. I would like to call upon all fellow Members from all the political groups to join with the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&amp;D), the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), the Greens/European Free Alliance (Verts/ALE) and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL), who have taken the initiative in drafting this resolution.

 Madam President, the euro is our common asset and, today, the trade unions told Parliament that they were concerned that employees themselves were paying the price for the crisis through a weak euro, a euro under attack and not through a growth-promoting, job-creating euro. It is therefore essential that we do not pursue a simple technical revision of the treaties and that the two major dysfunctions of the euro area revealed by the crisis are addressed. The first approach is to introduce eurobonds, as we have heard. Eurobonds will not only stabilise the level of the euro, they will also immediately counter the speculative attack. The second approach to introducing fiscal justice and to making the financial market pay the price for the crisis is precisely to introduce a tax on financial transactions so that it is not employees who, as a result of fiscal injustice, pay the price for this crisis. Finally, a European debt agency must be established, which must be able to pool some of the sovereign debt of the Member States. Finally, I would also like to support Mr Juncker and to say that increasing the stability fund, which was proposed by Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Director-General of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is a good idea. Early intervention – as we have heard – not being late and choosing to become strong and not weak would enable us to perform an act of governance that would re-introduce the confidence called for by our President, Martin Schultz. (Applause) Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, my group, in fact, wishes to see the two oral questions concerning both the report of the Van Rompuy task force and the six Commission legislative packages on economic governance reinstated in the order of business. Firstly, for an institutional reason, since Article 9 of the Treaty of Lisbon gives us this prerogative and this authority to have applied the horizontal social clause and, in particular, the study on the social impact for the sweeping measures, the sweeping directives and decisions that have consequences for our citizens. Mr John Monks, the General Secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, has just written about his concern at seeing austerity plans having a direct impact on the incomes of wage earners, their wages and also their pensions. The political reason for making this request, Mr President, on behalf of my group, is that we must show that, at a time when we are discussing market regulation, we are not only giving our verdict on the markets, but also voting and legislating in favour of our fellow citizens. I should like to see this House feel able to support the reinstatement of these oral questions. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, this work programme presents the recovery of growth and jobs, as well as economic regulation, as key to restoring confidence. That is true. Our model of economic development can no longer make do with strengthening the enforcement aspect of a Stability Pact that has continually shown its limitations. The recovery of growth must be centred on job creation throughout the Union in its entirety. We need to look at employment and social standards as indicators of economic power and, from that point of view, emphasise the need to put more thought into the European tax on financial transactions and into a greater coordination between the European Union and the European ministers for employment, as well as into the Union’s economic proposals. I support the Members who took the floor to highlight the importance of the directive on the posting of workers and on the services of general interest. I think that the European Union’s digital strategy is a crucial factor for this new economy. We should show more recognition of the Commission’s ambition on this point. With regard to citizenship, the Union should put the citizens back at the heart of the European project, and the increase in financial allocations should not only focus on security aspects, in particular, on managing migratory flows. Finally, I would end, Mr President, by saying that, in essence, this work programme for 2011 should be the very example of a policy that addresses in a positive way this temptation for nations to withdraw, which all our Member States are experiencing. I believe the European Commission has the power to change things. It can rely on a Parliament which will be a proactive force and will support it if it shows more ambition. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Mr President, the state of the Union for us today, in France, is that the citizens, the people, and also the streets are rumbling with discontent. Our fellow European citizens are experiencing an unprecedented crisis of confidence, and they have decided to march to the beat of refusal and demands, but also of hope. What is behind this is a failed proposal for reforming pensions, but not only this. What is at stake is getting older in a dignified manner. What is at stake is ensuring an intergenerational solidarity which allows the youngest people today also to live their working life, their professional life, with a pension from which they can benefit. On this very subject, Mr Barroso, the Commission published a Green Paper on the reform of pension systems which unleashed a wave of anxiety from the trade unions before the summer. The proposal that you have made to increase the retirement age seems unrealistic to me. It would be more useful if the Commission told us how we can make sure that workers are able to keep their jobs up to the legal retirement age. I would like to hear your proposals, and I would also like to hear some details on what you called the fiscal consolidation rather than the economic coordination of our Member States, which I think must be oriented towards social solidarity. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, I would like to congratulate our fellow Member Mr Cadec on his excellent work. The text put to the vote today marks a certain change in the way our institution views the concept of free trade. Without being protectionist, the line defended here may be described as less naïve. We all agree that European production is insufficient, and rather than immediately resorting to imports, we must first try to intensify our efforts to safeguard and regenerate stocks, including through the use of aquaculture, to ensure the sustainability of the sector and its jobs in the Union, as well as European fisheries that are less dependent on third countries. As for imports, we must guarantee that the European market in fishery and aquaculture products does not suffer unfair competition as a result of less strict health and social conditions and ludicrously low tariffs. That is why I favour a European label, in accordance with our standards, both environmental and social. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, you told us earlier that Europeans must be firm and united if they are to succeed at the G20, and that the European Union’s credibility on the international stage is at stake. However, what is at stake, above all, is the Union’s credibility in the eyes of its citizens, who expect it to be able to equip itself with credible instruments to exit the crisis. Firstly, I expected the conclusions of the European Council of 17 June to treat EU budgetary discipline, macro-economic surveillance and the regulation of financial services equally. It has to be said that this was not the case. Secondly, having clearly lacked internal solidarity in the face of the crisis, the European Union has a duty to lead the efforts to emerge from it. Let us be frank. Economic and monetary union is suffering from a structural fault, which creates an imbalance between monetary policy and economic policy, even though today, the euro accounts for 27% of the global reserves of central banks. That obliges the Member States and the Eurogroup to coordinate national economic policies. The euro must not be the symbol of high prices for our fellow citizens, and our duty today, at the end of these interim Councils, is no longer to simply reassure the markets. It is to reassure citizens of our ability to exit the crisis together. Thirdly, the tougher stance on budgetary discipline, at this time of crisis, must not aggravate the recession. We want evidence, evidence that the 2020 strategy will actually be accompanied by financial resources that are sufficient to develop, but also guide, the economy towards the spending of the future, towards employment and towards solid and fertile investments. Presidents, we must hear the warning being expressed today in anger and soon in fear. Identified as it is with unfair liberalism, the European Union must not become the symbol of brutal austerity. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, may I congratulate Mr Romeva i Rueda, who has managed to include the technical provisions resulting directly from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) meeting in Recife, as has already been said, while leaving open the possibility of adding further rules that might arise from forthcoming negotiations. This report also includes elements that will enable us to combat the phenomenon of illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing, and provides guidelines as regards stock regulation. I particularly support the report. Our vote is taking place at a fairly fraught time, following the European Commission’s decision last week to close purse seiner bluefin tuna fishing early. While a common ground appears to have been found – and for that I would like to acknowledge the step taken by Commissioner Damanaki, who reached an agreement with France, allocating additional quotas for small-scale and coastal fishing – there is still some doubt over the situation concerning purse seiners. The constraints faced by fishermen are very strict, and it is this kind of uncertainty that we must avoid, for our fishermen have to be sure they have a stable and level playing field. It is this objective of predictability that we will pursue in negotiations on the reform of the common fisheries policy. Predictability and sustainability must go together, particularly as regards decisions necessary for safeguarding stocks and the sector’s long-term future, as well as fishermen’s activity and income in the short term, with the objective being a fisheries sector that respects marine resources. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us say this clearly: the way in which the negotiations on the Anti­Counterfeiting Trade Agreement are being carried out is unacceptable to the European Parliament. As a new colegislator on this issue, the Treaty of Lisbon now guarantees us the right to full information at the same time as it is received by the Council. The documents that have ‘leaked out’ up to now have proved to us that, as far as form is concerned, this dimension absolutely was not respected. What can be said about the content? The fool’s bargain that seems to have been offered to Internet access providers is as follows: should they decide to cooperate in the systematic monitoring of the content carried on their networks, their current non­liability for such content would be maintained. Otherwise, they would be exposing themselves to legal actions by right holders and would be systematically penalised. I find such a turnaround extremely dangerous, as it would call into question the acquis communautaire
, not only on the principle of mere conduit – referred to in French as simple transport 
– in the e­Commerce Directive, but also in relation to respect for the fundamental rights of the citizens, which was brought up recently in our debate on the Telecoms package. I will conclude by reminding you that our Chamber has already shown its attachment to these principles by rejecting the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) Agreement. I have no doubt about its ability to start again. Therefore, I am anxious to stress the importance of the resolution that is being debated this evening. I welcome the work of our coordinator, Mr Arif, and of all of the negotiators from the Committee on International Trade, who have ensured that the signal that the European Parliament will give tomorrow will be extremely symbolic because it is unanimous. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Presidents, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, may I thank all the rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and for the huge task accomplished in spite of what were at times conflicting interests. The first result of our efforts is that Parliament can now state the direction in which it intends to steer the future common fisheries policy. The second result is that, during the negotiations, our priority was to ensure that this text responds to the concerns expressed by fishermen. We have succeeded in this: the provisions relating to transferable individual quotas have been withdrawn, and support for small-scale and coastal fishing has been maintained. The third anticipated result is that the forthcoming document must result in a participative and bottom-up approach, that is to say, in consultation with all those involved in the sector. It must also incorporate those elements that are essential to the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, notably, the human and social dimension of the entire sector, which must be combined effectively with the promotion of sustainable fishing practices and with the conservation of the fish stock as part of an ecosystemic approach. I would like to add that, if we want to succeed in an ambitious reform of the common fisheries policy, then we must devote a budget to it that matches our stated ambitions. Our political commitment will be judged according to the resources that we grant it. We expect the Commission … (The President cut off the speaker) Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Zapatero, thank you first of all, Mr Zapatero, for reintroducing ambition, political perspective and also energy, at a time when the European Union has to bounce back from the crisis and in the wake of the failure in Copenhagen. I expect the Commission and the Presidency to enable us to put the creation of more and higher quality jobs, the fight against social exclusion, and sustainable development at the heart of the 2020 strategy. This is true in particular for the agriculture budget, and also for the fisheries budget. You have committed yourself to this. Mr Zapatero, we are counting on you to provide the resources for this policy, to associate the decontamination of soil with food security, to create the conditions for green jobs and for the preservation of fisheries resources, to ensure food security and to create fairer trading conditions for the countries of the South. We need an ambitious agriculture budget, and I would also ask you to link the fisheries budget with this budget. On these points, our jobs, but also our policy, will be judged on the basis of the results achieved. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Presidents, Minister, the Swedish Presidency has had what may be described as some historic moments: the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the appointments of the first President of the European Council and of the High Representative, but also the climate change conference and the appointment of a new Commission, as well as – please allow me this brief reference – the telecoms package. These events have created hope. All things considered, however, there remain one or two mixed results. Firstly, our Parliament, being committed to the introduction of European supervision of the financial markets, welcomed the proposals made by Mr de Larosière’s group of wise men as a crucial step. However, the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council of 2 December are well below this realistic level of ambition. I wish to mention at this point that Parliament will be sure to restore some balance to the proposals that have been referred to it, in order to make the financial markets more robust. The same applies to the financial commitments pledged to the countries of the South to help them combat climate change. Even though, in Copenhagen, poor countries require real commitments concerning long-term financing, the Council has only managed to pledge EUR 7.2 billion over three years. This is a first step, true, but it falls far short of the requirements, all the more so since part of it comes from a restructuring exercise. Lastly, in the financial field, we welcome the will to impose rules and to act forcefully with regard to both supervision and taxation. I note in particular, in the Council conclusions, the reference to a global financial transaction levy. This is something for which we socialists have been hoping and praying for more than 10 years. There is still work to be done. Seeking out new financial resources to promote employment, solidarity within and outside Europe, and the financing of the fight against climate change, is a major challenge. As it will soon be Christmas, I invite the Council to give us a decision on own resources in the years to come. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, on Thursday the European Union appointed Mr Van Rompuy as its first permanent President of the Council and Mrs Ashton to be in charge of European diplomacy. Ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to return to the debate that has been taking place in our institutions since these appointments were announced. Indeed, in my opinion, beyond the issue of names and functions, there is the central issue of the States. Let me explain what I mean. We are witnessing what could be the worst nightmare of those who conveyed the ideal of the European Community and their desire for union. At that time, it was believed that the roots of the Union were to be found in state legitimacy and that its future lay in transcending national selfishness. Tension between two contradictory mediums, which is sometimes painful, often produces original mechanisms, but, above all, serves a political approach that is unique in the world. This nightmare, ladies and gentlemen, is that of a Europe that would be limited to a community of intergovernmental acquisitions. The result, as we can see today, would be suspicion of incompetence, presumption of illegitimacy and tension between political families. In making this speech, I do not intend, as you will have gathered, to return to making judgments on mere intent. I prefer to recall with you the rights and duties of we MEPs. Our duty is to question the impenetrable haggling that surrounds appointments to the posts that resulted from the Treaty of Lisbon. Our duty, in future, is to force the Council to put an end to this undemocratic, archaic method of appointment that fosters the idea that Europe, in building itself, is sheltered from the peoples. Our duty is to use all our new parliamentary prerogatives to influence the policies that will result from the new powers guaranteed to us under the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament, between a weakened Commission and a strengthened intergovernmental centre, needs to become the institutional point of equilibrium. On this matter, I hope that the Vice-President of the Commission will be subject to the same hearing process by the European Parliament as the other commissioners. Indeed, we have a right to carry out this process; it is conferred by the treaties. I also support the proposal of Mrs Harms, who has suggested a meeting between the new President and the groups as a whole. Our duty is to kick-start European integration, which is in a seriously bad way. No one can reasonably want the mandates entrusted to Mr Van Rompuy or Mrs Ashton to fail and, more especially, I wish Mrs Ashton every success because I am proud that a woman has been appointed to this post of High Representative.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we are once again – this time for the last time – to discuss the telecom package and, more specifically, my report on the ‘framework’, ‘access’ and ‘authorisation’ directives, which represents the final cornerstone. This is an opportunity for me to thank my colleagues, particularly my co-rapporteurs Pilar del Castillo and Malcolm Harbour; the chair of the Conciliation Committee, Mr Vidal-Quadras; the chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Herbert Reul, and all the services of the European Parliament that were involved. I also wish to thank the Commissioner for her involvement and support throughout this period, and I thank her services as well. Finally, I also welcome the efforts of the Swedish Presidency to reach a satisfying conclusion. Let us take a moment to remember Ulrika Barklund Larsson. Tomorrow’s vote will give a very positive signal to those expecting a more dynamic European industrial policy. As the second reading agreement on 99% of the text has been maintained, I shall just summarise the aspects that we made our priority. In particular, we wanted to maintain effective, lasting competition, but also to make that competition useful to economic and social development through complete coverage of European territory in terms of access, high speed internet for all and for all regions – including better management of radio spectrum – and full rights for consumers. This will involve establishing a consistent, operational framework for those who will be using these directives, that is, regulators, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications and the Commission; guaranteeing legal certainty; encouraging the investment needed to relaunch our economy and make the market dynamic for operators, their consumers and employees; and, finally, developing plenty of high-quality services that are accessible to the majority and fairly priced. It is important that we remain within the terms of the agreement and, unfortunately, recent statements made by certain Member States raise some doubt over their commitment on this matter. I shall support the Commission’s interpretation of the result of our negotiations over Article 19. As a matter of interest, the wording chosen for this article is closely linked to the debate on the mechanisms of Articles 7 and 7a. It would be disappointing if the Council, through non-binding declarations, put across the message that it somehow wanted to have its cake and eat it by denying a fair balance of powers between Member States, BEREC and the Commission, as emerged in the final compromise. Finally, of course, the salient point that led us to conciliation: Amendment 138. I would just like to say that the result obtained was the maximum that Parliament could obtain with the legal basis we had: harmonisation of the internal market. So this result must not be taken lightly, since it offers all users of electronic connections solid protection of their right to privacy, to presumption of innocence and to contradictory procedure, no matter what course of action they face and before any sanctions are adopted. I am also delighted by the Commission’s willingness to assess the situation of net neutrality in Europe and to make the appropriate instruments available to Parliament and the Council by the end of the year, based on the result of these observations. To conclude, I therefore ask everyone to think about the transposition of the package. I am already aware that Parliament, to which this package means a great deal, will make sure that the transposition is undertaken with respect for past agreements. Mr President, I will now listen carefully to my colleagues’ speeches before taking the floor again at the end of the debate. Catherine Trautmann,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR)
 Mr President, may I express my warmest thanks to my colleagues who have taken part in this debate and say that they have certainly made clear what a perilous and difficult job we have had to complete this telecom package. Ultimately, it was held up by an amendment on which we have resoundingly voted several times in this Parliament, but which was not accepted by the Council. Like others, I believe this to be a basis and not an end. We have not succeeded on this point as we have on others. In the Commissioner’s response, she also stressed the same thing about Article 19. I had hoped we would go much further in implementing a procedure of economic arbitration with regard to European regulators, but of course, we could not achieve everything at once. We tried to be efficient, fair and balanced; we wanted to show that, while the internet and digital society are driven by use and mobility, citizens’ rights should never be ridiculed, scorned or ignored. This is the first time that a text of this kind includes such a reference in its first article, making it a basic principle and linking the internet with the exercise of rights and fundamental freedoms; we believe this makes what we are doing quite distinctive when we legislate with the Council and draft texts with the Commission. Indeed, we think that the information society should be both respectful of citizens’ rights and positive from an economic and social point of view, opening up a new cultural sphere. That is why we anticipate that the market will enable this to happen, that users’ rights will be stated and guaranteed, but that we can also have this extended access and connectivity for all. However, this is also why we now have a considerable job to do in the areas of copyright, net neutrality and radio spectrum. The European Parliament will lend its support. I would like to say what a pleasure it has been to work with my colleagues and how delighted I am that this compromise respects the vote that we so strongly expressed together.

Madam President, Mr Barroso, I might as well say it straight away: you did not convince the French socialists for five years, and you are not succeeding in convincing us now with a project in which you are as generous in word as you are general in purpose. How can you say to us ‘vote for me if you want a Europe that is united in its diversity’, when it is precisely because we want this Europe that we are recommending waiting for the Irish vote so as to vote on your candidacy? Armed with the support of the Member States, you preferred to secure your appointment ahead of time and with fewer risks as regards the number of votes required. You thought that the passage before Parliament would be a mere formality: it is not so, and this is just the beginning, for your response does not meet the expectations of the citizens, who are suffering in the crisis and who have demonstrated their anger towards our institutions through their low turnout. You say that the crisis has changed you and you pose as the great navigator of a united Europe, but you have not been able to guide the Member States towards a truly European recovery plan, and we are still awaiting the concrete and binding measures needed for financial regulation. You claim to have given us guarantees regarding the social agenda, but all you are advocating is a new regulation, not a review of the Posting of Workers Directive. Moreover, you have not made a firm, and above all clear, commitment on a directive protecting public services. You show contempt for the MEPs’ memory of events. We have not forgotten that, over the last five years, social issues have never been at the heart of the proposed solutions, and it is only now that you are agreeing to a social impact study for each piece of European legislation. In a period of unprecedented crisis, which is destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs, everything must be done to ensure that the number of European unemployed workers or working poor does not reach 25 million by 2010. For this we need an industrial policy to be adopted. The citizens need to be set an example of solidarity in order to combat the crisis. Neither in your words nor in your declared ambition for Europe will they find this impetus today. To carry on as before is disastrous, said the philosopher, Walter Benjamin. You still have a very long way to go to win over the socialists and the social democrats. For the sake of political consistency and out of respect for our electorate, we shall not vote for you.

 We Socialists have always denounced the lack of transparency in the negotiations on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and our fight to refuse this agreement has steadily been gaining ground in Parliament, where five parliamentary committees have rejected it. There was therefore only one responsible answer that we could give to citizens regarding the ACTA: for Parliament to reject it in plenary. Despite the numerous delaying tactics by the right, and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in particular, that is exactly what we have done here today and I am delighted. Parliament therefore remains at the forefront of protecting the most stringent European standards on fundamental rights. I wish, in this respect, to acknowledge the work of my predecessor, Kader Arif. The ACTA was the worst possible response to what is a real problem: an agreement that has no effect in beating the scourge of counterfeiting, but, what is more, a potentially dangerous agreement for the fundamental freedoms of European citizens with its massive legal uncertainties. In addition, many other concerns were raised about neutrality, about open access to the Internet, about access to generic drugs or about the protection of geographical indications. Clearly, it did not come up to scratch. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

I voted against the Passenger Name Record (PNR) Agreement between the United States and the EU on the use and transfer of the name records of European passengers. I opposed this agreement as the negotiations in Parliament did not enable a compromise to be found on the necessary guarantees to protect the data of European passengers. Indeed, no provisions have been made to specify the purpose to which the data is put, which has been left too vague, to reduce the retention period of 15 years without, however, making provision for them to be deleted at a later date, and guarantees that the Member States concerned have given their consent if their nationals’ data are transferred to third countries`	.  The list of data to be transferred is also disproportionate leaving a great number of issues open, and does not make any provision for confidential treatment of sensitive data. Finally, it is a very rigid agreement, as judicial redress for Europeans in US courts is very limited, and no provision is made for the presence of the European Parliament and Member States in the review procedures for this agreement. I am not questioning the need to achieve transatlantic cooperation against terrorism, but rather the means chosen to achieve this, which run counter to the high data protection standards supported by the French Socialists.

 I voted for the report of the European Parliament on the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base. On the one hand, this report provides for harmonising the corporate tax base for companies at European level, that is taxable profits, and on the other hand, companies and groups of companies operating within the internal market will be able to add together the profits and losses of their own subsidiaries located in different Member States. The net profit will then be apportioned between these different states on the basis of a mathematical formula and pre-defined factors. The European Parliament spoke with a single voice, thanks to this text, in favour of the progressively obligatory nature of this Common Consolidated Tax Base, a major step forward in terms of adopting a political stance against fiscal dumping and relocations within Europe. An essential element in tackling this phenomenon is still lacking, however, insofar as no agreement has been reached, and that was not the aim of this directive, on the tax rates imposed by each Member State, which remain diverse. It is therefore progress in terms of politics, but is unlikely to be taken up by the Council. It is merely the first brick in the wall of a long struggle to regulate the European market.

 The European Parliament has been consulted on the reform of the system of taxation of energy products and electricity. While I voted in favour of Ms Lulling’s report, I believe that if it is to be understood and accepted by citizens, this change should take place gradually, bearing in mind the current socio-economic situation. Today, the cost of fuel is already a major expense for family incomes, and some families have consequently started to change their consumer habits. That is why I am opposed to the ‘proportionality’ principle between the different threshold levels applicable to each type of energy, which is likely to cause a very great increase in the cost of diesel, a widely-used fuel in France. Europe’s ecological objectives must not be achieved at the expense of the objectives of employment, competitiveness, and protection of consumers’ purchasing power, but must go hand in hand with these. Let us hope that the Council, the sole decision maker in fiscal matters, will listen to this message from the MEPs. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 At the end of 2011, the procedure for drawing up the 2012 budget was marked by deep rifts between Parliament and the Council concerning the financing of ITER, the thermonuclear fusion research project based at Cadarache in the Bouches-du-Rhône. EUR 750 million of cost overruns compared with the initial estimates had to be found for 2012 and only EUR 100 million had been agreed by the end of 2011. A compromise therefore had to be found for the remaining EUR 650 million. After long negotiations with the Council, Parliament succeeded in getting this money released by increasing the financial ceiling of the budget heading concerned, while the Council initially envisaged financing solely through the redeployment of funds from the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development. The additional financing needed for the ITER project in 2012 will therefore be available without the other research programmes being compromised. Along with all the Members of the European Parliament, I will nonetheless remain vigilant as to the sources of financing that will be mobilised in 2013 to cover the overrun that has already been announced. It is our duty to ensure that the ITER project will not be financed to the detriment of other priority policies of the EU 2020 strategy. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 While the debates on the future of the post-2014 cohesion policy have just begun in the European Parliament, which has been granted power of codecision on this matter under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament wanted to point out the specific nature of the outermost regions (ORs) – including the French overseas departments and territories – and the need to grant them adequate resources for their economic and social development. On account of their remoteness, their insularity and their extreme climatic conditions, these territories do actually need differential treatment, both for the viability of local agricultural and industrial production and for the successful implementation of the various EU programmes and remits. As such, the Commission’s proposal to halve the budget allocated to offset the additional costs on these territories is highly regrettable. What is more, I had proposed amendments on this subject in the opinion that the Committee on Budgets issued on the Teixeira report, and I had pointed out the need to include the accession of Mayotte to OR status in the 2014-2020 financial forecasts for these regions. In 2014, Mayotte will actually become the fifth outermost French territory recognised by the European Union. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 After 18 long months of negotiations with the Council, Parliament has finally been able to agree to the new regulation on over-the-counter derivatives. Traders are now required to clear these contracts through central counterparties and to report all derivatives, even those not negotiated over the counter. Moreover, the powers of intervention of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) have been increased in terms of settling disputes between national regulators. These decisions were considered essential in order to improve the transparency of the financial markets, given that derivatives had a large part to play in aggravating the volatility of the markets during the 2008 crisis. However, this is only a first step in regulating the financial sector: others, which Parliament could not support because of the Council’s opposition, will have to be examined in the future, in particular, enhancing the role of ESMA.

 While the debates on the general budget for the European Union for 2013 are already showing signs of becoming strained between Parliament and the Council, we, the MEPs, are in the process of drawing up the next operational budget for our institution. Aware of certain budgetary constraints, we have evaluated the change in our funding requirements at + 1.9% in comparison with 2012, an increase below the level of inflation. Some budget lines will be subject to freezing in order to achieve this target, such as Members’ allowances, transport costs, etc. Other areas will also need to be studied closely in order to avoid any overspending: this is the case for costs relating to building maintenance or the establishment of the House of European History. Over the course of the year, we will also need to be more vigilant about some additional necessary loans, such as those relating to the accession of Croatia, which have still not been included in the budget’s provisions. Parliament must be exemplary in establishing its budget to ensure that it has the means to fully guarantee its democratically received powers while controlling its spending within reasonable limits.

 Every year, the European Commission publishes a report on the state of gender equality in Europe. Unfortunately, the same findings recur every year: gender stereotyping, ancestral taboos and an outdated view of the division of roles between women and men persist, preventing any improvement in the circumstances of women in the European Union. In 2011, the crisis helped make the situation worse, since, in affecting women more severely than men, it undermined their economic independence. Employment, access to positions of political and economic responsibility, freedom and sexual health: all issues that still require a continuous struggle in order to achieve genuine gender equality. This also has to be a daily struggle, in everyday life as well as in the European Parliament, where, at every opportunity, almost one third of Members regrettably call into question the issue of access to contraception and abortion.

 By defining the general guidelines for the preparation of the 2013 budget, Parliament wanted to focus mainly on support for jobs (especially for young people) and SMEs. These priorities bear a strange resemblance to the priorities Parliament defined for the 2012 budget. Now, the difficulties of the latest budget negotiations are already putting in doubt the result of the discussions that are soon to take place on the drafting of the 2013 budget. Are the budget guidelines merely Parliament’s pious hopes? I fear so, as the negotiations have followed the same tragic route for two years: the draft budget from the Commission, supported by Parliament, undergoes cuts by the Council, which is more interested in reducing its contribution to the EU budget than in the budget’s added-value. This fool’s game has been played since Parliament failed to use its new powers of budgetary codecision to oppose the Council’s sterile wishes in 2010. 2012 will also be the year when the 2014-2020 financial framework is drafted. It will be difficult to prevent the Council’s short-term ‘in times of crisis’ vision from being applied to the definition of the ‘post-crisis’ financial perspectives. We must, however, support an ambitious position, for a Europe in line with the expectations of Europeans. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Mr President, we should, of course, be glad that the Member States have finally reached an agreement to ensure the immediate future of the European food aid programme for the most deprived citizens. This agreement was vital for millions of Europeans who have already been given a rough ride because of the crisis but it is far, far from enough. In fact, it is conditional upon the withdrawal of the Food Aid Programme in 2014, and on the will of the German Chancellor, a will that unfortunately is not upset, that Europe is no longer funding any social policy of this type beyond that date. We are Europe. We have core values and shared ideals that we support: peace, prosperity, of course, but also solidarity and the right to dignity, given that dignity is the opposite of humiliation … (The President asked the speaker to slow down) Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

The decision taken under the French Presidency to do away with quotas risked leaving milk producers without any safeguards in the case of market disturbances. We therefore welcome the ‘milk package’ proposal as a first step in the right direction. It was necessary to strengthen producers’ negotiating power in relation to the private processing industry by encouraging them to group together and promoting the use of contracts, which are only used for half of all production. My Socialist colleagues, especially Stéphane Le Foll, helped to improve the proposal by ensuring the future of milk production in vulnerable regions where cheeses with protected designations are made. There is still a great deal to do, however. In particular, it will be essential to shift the balance back towards livestock farming and provide other market tools in order to prevent any further crises in the milk sector. We must take the opportunity presented by the CAP reform to supplement this mechanism so as to guarantee farmers’ income and once again put them back where they belong at the heart of the food supply chain and food safety in Europe.

 Mr Fisas Ayxela’s report gave Parliament the opportunity to support the European Commission’s communication of 18 January 2011 on developing the European dimension in sport, this being the Commission’s first policy document on this subject since it became a Community responsibility. While I welcome the report’s commitment to reminding us of the key values that playing sport can convey and suggesting the type of actions that should reflect the Community added value in this field, I wonder about the EU’s current ability to effectively assume this responsibility. With only EUR 4 million specifically dedicated to sport each year (in the form of a ‘preparatory action’, in other words, a temporary action), the Union does not have the resources to effectively combat doping, to support sport for people with disabilities, to promote the development of a ‘European identity’ through sport, etc., an issue that must be addressed in the months ahead, when Member States are being asked to establish the EU budgetary framework for 2014-2020.

 Could Mr Gauzès specify the nature of the commitments made by Renault to Mr Bertrand, the relevant minister, which appear to him to be serious? Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 – (FR)
 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, led by my conscience and my sense of responsibility, I will vote against the French Government’s application for aid on behalf of Renault, and I will do so as an individual. Because, unlike other groups, Renault refused to take account of the situation of former, older, workers laid off in 2009 and soon left with nothing following the entry into force of the reform of the pension system. Because, with profits of more than EUR 3 billion in 2010, the Renault Group exploits the full potentialities of globalisation. Because I think that, at a time when everyone is being urged to tighten their belts, signing a blank cheque for EUR 24.5 million with no quid pro quo
 is outrageous. Because, finally, Commissioner, the training and support measures presented by the applicants as active back-to-work measures, the only ones eligible for funding under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) are, in fact, disconnected from any resumption-of-activity logic. This is not about salving our consciences by creating the illusion that we are supporting European industry. In the end, what counts is that we support the interests of the workers in the industry and the associated jobs. This is a case in which the EGF is being derailed, and we must draw the necessary conclusions in order to adapt it. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, we wish to table an oral amendment. After contact was made on numerous occasions, the management of Renault and the French Government have so far refused to take into account the situation of company workers who, in 2009, agreed to leave the company and are affected by the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) application and who, since then, have seen their rights eroded and their income reduced through the application of the reform of the French pension system. The amendment is as follows: Paragraph 2a: calls on Renault and the French Government to commit themselves formally to take the necessary legal and financial measures to restore all rights and pension benefits, while granting work exemption under equivalent conditions to workers whose pension benefits were affected by reforms having entered into force since their dismissal.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome the strengthening of the mandate for the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) as proposed in this report, and I would like to support this great need to deepen integration of maritime safety by giving the example of transnational cooperation in the English Channel, which is in decline. After 10 years of Franco-British cofinancing of an emergency tow vessel, the UK Government has now decided to stop funding the vessel as part of its cutbacks, thereby reducing the safety of that sea crossing, one of the busiest in the world, which is being hit hard by the impact of privatising these services and the lack of a shared vision. It is therefore vital that the national authorities responsible for transposing this legislation – primarily the national coastguard services – act in unison in order to guarantee the efficiency and durability of transnational actions. I therefore believe it is of utmost importance for EMSA to show concern for safety in the English Channel and coordinate the action taken by Member States in that area. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this report because the European Union must increase aid for its regions, particularly rural ones, in order to encourage economic recovery. We must therefore support the Commission’s proposal to temporarily increase the Union’s maximum cofinancing rate for EAFRD (European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development) programmes in struggling States that receive support from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (euro area) or the balance of payments facility for non-euro area Member States. The Commission’s proposal is nonetheless paradoxical since, at the same time, it claims to be in favour of the Franco-German proposal to suspend the payment of regional funds to struggling States in order to force them to put their public accounts in order. Penalising those States by suspending cohesion policy funds, while offering increased support for EAFRD programmes, amounts to arbitrary discrimination against non-agricultural areas. If it is to recover from the economic crisis, the European Union must lend its support to all of those regions that are struggling. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find it hard to celebrate the fact that we have reached an agreement with the Council on financing the extra cost of ITER. The point of these discussions (which muddied the negotiations on the budget) was not simply to find a solution for ITER. The main issue was, in fact, to deal with the underfunding of the European Union budget, which has become a structural problem to the extent that we are now in a position of questioning whether or not the EU has the capacity to honour its international commitments. The ITER project is yet another illustration of the fact that the EU budget is not adequate to meet either the EU’s ambitions or our strategies. The reason that ITER has become, and will continue to be, one of the greatest sources of ongoing tension between Parliament and the Council is that Member States are demanding ever more from the European Union on the project, but are not willing to bear the financial consequences. By tinkering around the edges, and proposing short term solutions for funding these increasingly costly major projects, Member States are jeopardising the Union’s capacity, from 2013 onwards, to afford the tasks for which it is responsible. For the period 2014 to 2020, by deciding to remove the ITER and GMES projects from the next financial framework, even though they were both established as research and development projects by a majority vote, the Commission is admitting that it is actually unable to guarantee that the financial resources will be there to meet our responsibilities. This is a serious admission of failure and incapacity. The Union does not have the wherewithal to abide by its international commitments, and yet research, innovation and energy are among the major aims of the 2020 strategy, along with employment, sustainable development and growth. Pitting these different priorities against each other is not the way to … (The President cut off the speaker) Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, this 2012 budget is the Council budget, to which the European Parliament has added a little spiritual something by ensuring the inclusion of a few priorities, but priorities in the form of commitment appropriations, which, Commissioner, will exacerbate the problem of amounts outstanding. The countercyclical development and growth targets have again been severely obstructed in the EU budget for 2012. Firstly, because competition between programmes, which is the consequence of cutting costs willy-nilly, has been given priority at the expense of structuring measures that would allow us to take an active role in overcoming the crisis. Secondly, because Member States are refusing to honour payments in a timely manner – despite being legally required to do so – and are therefore deterring project leaders from developing structural initiatives. Lastly, because the Council has refused to increase, among other things, the funding for financial supervisory authorities and to further the creation of a proper fund to manage farming crises, thereby turning a blind eye to the context in which this budget will have to be implemented. The Member States are therefore imposing austerity measures on the European Union, just as they have done for their own citizens. The current negotiations on this budget are merely the precursor to the impending negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework. It will be hard to resolve the apparent lack of confidence between the institutions, resulting, in particular, from the Council’s decision to question the figures provided by the Commission, which I am sure you appreciated, Commissioner, and the failure to comply with decisions that apply to both branches of the budgetary authority. Yet there are instruments in place for that purpose – I am referring to new own resources, which could put an end to the inevitable deadlock created by the antagonism between net contributors and net beneficiaries. There is now no time to waste. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 I voted for Ms Berès’s resolution as it is vitally important for the emergence of European economic governance to go hand in hand with greater democratic scrutiny. In order to deal with the major changes that will have to take place if it is to emerge from the crisis, the EU must ensure the strong democratic legitimacy of its decisions. This legitimacy can only be guaranteed with the European Parliament’s support and involvement in the annual drafting of the EU’s main economic policy guidelines. In particular, it is essential for Parliament to participate in the European Semester procedure, during which each of the 27 draft national budgets is assessed by the European Commission. Following this procedure, Parliament should have the chance to amend the macro-economic policy guidelines proposed to Member States. This democratic development also requires enhanced dialogue with the national parliaments and the social partners in order to support European economic policy coherence and guarantee that the EU 2020 objectives are taken into account. Finally, it is vital that the Treaties be revised only with the agreement and, where necessary, the involvement, of Parliament. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 The maritime area is changing. There are numerous challenges in this area, starting with the need for shared use. In particular, this means developing fishery-related jobs, which must be an objective of the common fisheries policy; strengthening maritime freight; harnessing the extraordinary industrial potential of offshore wind parks; and developing tourism activities. There can be no policy without a budget; we therefore need to ensure that the integrated maritime policy has its place in the future multiannual financial framework. However, I would say that, if this policy is to be a success, it is vital to get the Member States well and truly on board. This policy requires cross-sectoral but also transnational cooperation. However, in the Channel, transnational cooperation is waning. After 10 years of cofinancing an emergency tow vessel with France, the UK Government has now decided, as part of its cutbacks, to privatise its coastguard service, thereby reducing the safety of that sea crossing, one of the busiest in the world, which is being hit hard by the lack of a shared vision. An integrated maritime policy at European level must therefore be based on a synergy between national maritime policies, a synergy enhanced by a European ambition, which is itself equipped with adequate financial resources.

 I voted in favour of the report on illegal fishing at the global level, because its aim is beyond dispute. Illegal fishing unfairly competes with legal fishing and also often goes hand in hand with serious social conditions. There is no international framework today in which to share common standards. It is therefore vital for the European Union to become a proactive force in the bodies to which it belongs. During the forthcoming debates on the common fisheries policy, I will, however, be keeping a close eye on the issue of sanctions, which is raised in this report. Indeed, the resolution recommends withdrawing European subsidies for those who breach the rules. This proposal will need to be discussed with local players before it is taken any further. The entry into force of the point-based licence is also welcomed; I am unable to support this given the state of the current implementing arrangements. Furthermore, and in view of the UK Government’s recent decision to stop subsidising safety in the Channel, I made sure that it was spelt out in the report that the Union needs to improve its own operations, in particular, by creating a European coastguard, so as to ensure that our actions are more coordinated and effective.

 The report on the European platform against poverty and social exclusion, submitted by Frédéric Daerden, highlights a depressing paradox: whilst 116 million Europeans are threatened with poverty and 42 million of them are experiencing extreme material deprivation, the EU 2020 strategy only sets a target of 20 million in terms of reducing the number of people threatened by poverty. Is this an acknowledgement of weakness or an admission of the abandonment of the principle of solidarity, one of the Union’s founding values? Unfortunately, it can be seen in this way, given the ‘solution’ for the Food Distribution Programme for the Most Deprived Persons of the Community: it will be safeguarded for 2012 and 2013, but with unacceptable conditions, namely, the definitive scrapping of this programme and the abandonment of any EU-level social policy from 2014. This proposal is a provocation at a time when citizens are sorely affected by the crisis and austerity plans. It threatens to reinforce the impression of economic, social and moral regression. This is why, out of respect for the idea of a progressive, supportive Europe, we must continue to rally round this programme: for my part, I shall be paying particular attention during the negotiations on the financial perspectives after 2013.

 Mr President, for the second year running we are in a no-win situation, as the Commission – correct me if I am wrong, Commissioner – has produced a budget proposal that will barely be enough to implement the programmes we have undertaken, and will certainly not develop them or take on board the powers of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Council is clinging to its austerity dogma, and arbitrarily deciding on cuts to programmes that are extremely important in the light of the economic and social climate. Our proposal seeks to mobilise the EU budget to work towards the Europe 2020 strategy goals, and places the emphasis on programmes for research, employment, competitiveness, cohesion and public investment. It is a cohesive position, and one which we owe to the strong commitment of our rapporteur, Ms Balzani. We owe her our thanks for this. The EU budget is underfunded, due to the squeeze by Member States whose only goals are austerity, reducing public expenditure, punishing the regions – I am referring to macroeconomic conditionality – and punishing citizens, starting with the most deprived among them. I am referring to the deplorably sad fate that the Council intends to mete out to the European food aid scheme for the most deprived. If we take an honest look at the situation, at present we have no own resources, no Eurobonds, a predominantly intergovernmental method, a budget that is derisory, as this discussion also seems to be, considering the stakes at play in the European Summit and the billions that Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy are waving about to reassure the financial markets.

 I abstained on this resolution because, as the Commission has confirmed to us, referral to the Court of Justice of the European Union would block the parliamentary consent procedure, when the period of validity of the Protocol to the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco is due to expire at the end of February. In order to prevent Parliament, which unfortunately has been consulted far too late, from having its decision-making powers blocked, I chose to abstain by taking the view that the debate should focus not on this resolution but on the Protocol. Furthermore, since the fishermen are already fishing off the Moroccan coast, Parliament’s vote will only have a retroactive effect. If we want to obtain proper guarantees from the Commission and the Moroccan Government regarding the benefits of these activities for all the populations concerned and regarding the economic importance that they represent for the EU, then it is on the future agreement, which will replace the previous agreement from February onwards, that we will have to focus all our efforts. I am confident that the Commission will be able to negotiate a new agreement that lives up to expectations and that it will involve Parliament, so that it is not in danger of having its powers blocked again.

 Along with the majority of members in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I voted against four of the six reports from the economic governance package. I voted in favour of the report on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances and abstained on the report on the enforcement measures to correct macroeconomic imbalances. Most of the new measures, which follow multiple negotiations conducted in Brussels, merely impose austerity on citizens without taking account of the economic recovery that we need if we are to get back on the path to growth and employment. The Ferreira report was alone in offering persuasive solutions in this area. Indeed, this report provides for the guaranteed protection of social rights and the introduction of a very wide range of economic indicators which allow the situation in each country to be properly taken into account. It also advocates a symmetrical approach, pointing the finger at those Member States with huge trade surpluses as being responsible for developing macroeconomic imbalances.

 Mr President, the European Council of Ministers for Agriculture failed to oppose a reduction of 75% in food aid to the most deprived. Seventy-five per cent! What we see on the ground is that the blocking of this programme by a minority of Member States arouses outrage, incomprehension and exasperation among members of the public, charities and their volunteers and, of course, beneficiaries. This situation undermines the credibility and image of the Union. Our citizens are aware that Europe is devoting a great deal of energy and resources to reassuring the markets, as demonstrated in the speech given by Mr Barroso this morning, and that it is mobilising less and less to come to the aid of the populations hardest hit by the crisis. That gives rise to a feeling of injustice and mistrust of the European institutions, which is potentially explosive, socially and democratically. Commissioner, as you said, Parliament has taken its responsibilities seriously, as has the Commission. It is now up to the Member States, including France, whose leaders are shedding crocodile tears over this programme, to reach agreement. If they so wish – as you said, Commissioner, it is matter of political will – on Monday this matter will be closed in the Council of Ministers for Employment and Social Affairs. It should never have been opened out of solidarity and respect for the beneficiaries. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy market integrity and transparency. The regulation lays down new rules that are designed to stop abusive practices in the wholesale energy markets, among other means by giving more powers to monitor and impose penalties to the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), which was set up in 2009. Considering that at present one of the main objectives of EU energy policy is to complete the establishment of the internal gas and electricity market, and that research and investment are concentrating on developing trans-European energy networks, it is extremely important for this new market to be governed by rules that will protect consumers. We can also expect energy trading between Member States to increase over the next few years. The research currently being done in the North Sea on creating a network capable of transporting offshore wind energy is just one example of what is needed for the future. It will therefore be beneficial to provide an appropriate legislative framework for this new market, so that it can develop properly and expand within a clearly defined legal framework.

 I voted in favour of the review of the Regulation on the Frontex Agency because it was vital to clarify its role and responsibilities while ensuring that it respects migrants’ fundamental rights when carrying out its operations. The need for this review has become even more obvious in the light of the Arab revolutions and the migratory movements that have followed. I therefore welcome several of the proposed amendments, such as the establishment of a consultative forum, which will exercise greater control over Frontex’s activities, and the requirement for the agency to undertake rescue at sea during humanitarian emergencies, or face the suspension of its operations. The possibility that the agency will not have to depend any more on the Member States, by acquiring its equipment itself, together with the increased information given to Parliament, are amendments that will help to clarify the link between Frontex and political decisions. One aspect that has particularly caught my attention is the creation, thanks to this regulation, of the status of European border guards. This development, which is only terminological at present, is an innovation that may, we hope, have a bearing on other groups of professionals requiring the same coordination, such as the coastguards of the various Member States, for example.

 I voted in favour of the report by the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis, as drafted by my colleague, Pervenche Berès, as it proposes ambitious yet practical solutions to help the EU come out of the financial, economic and social crisis from which European citizens are suffering on a daily basis. It is only by implementing Europe-wide solutions, such as issuing Eurobonds, which will enable more effective management of sovereign debt, greater investment in education, research and vocational education and the establishment of sound, effective economic governance, that Europe will be able to come out of this crisis for good. In its report by the Special Committee on Policy Challenges of 8 June 2011, Parliament called for EU budget resources to match the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. However, this message was regrettably not repeated in the final version of the Crisis Committee’s report. If we are to implement the Europe 2020 strategy, boost Europe’s economy and promote employment, we will certainly need a substantial increase in the EU budget over the next few years.

 Mr President, I should like to thank our rapporteur and praise the quality of the draft text of this mandate for the trialogue, which stresses the urgency of finally mobilising the annual budgets for the benefit of the Europe 2020 strategy and in a way that is consistent with the European semester approach. Nevertheless, the negotiations promise to be difficult, since the Commission’s guiding principle is to satisfy, by presenting a squeezed budget, the austerity requirements imposed by the Member States, while ignoring citizens’ needs. In this respect, the fate awaiting the food aid programmes targeting the most impoverished populations is symptomatic. Like many of my fellow Members, Commissioner, I was informed by the press that the European Commission is planning to drastically cut funding for the Most Deprived Persons (MDP) programme. Thus, it would be divided by four, from 500 million this year to only 113 million next year. The Union currently spends EUR 1 per capita and per year to defend the fundamental principle of these citizens’ right to food, in a rationale of European solidarity. The scrapping of this symbolic euro on the altar of national self-interests and budgetary austerity illustrates Europe’s moral and political failure. It is often said that the level of development of a human society can be measured by how it cares for its most vulnerable and deprived members. To cite technical and legal difficulties as an excuse for dismantling this food aid programme is disastrous not only for the people concerned but also for Europe’s credibility and image. The Commission is making fools of MEPs and the citizens they represent by proposing amounts in April and then dividing them by four two months later. Commissioner, I hope that you will change your mind on this particular decision, and that you will not remain deaf to the political objectives and budgetary intentions thereof which are expressed in this mandate for the trialogue.

 I voted in favour of this report on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste to send a clear message to the Member States: polluters must be held responsible for their waste. Indeed, whether it is a question of waste resulting from activities relating to the production of electricity or activities in other areas such as medicine, research and industry, the export of radioactive waste to third countries is an irresponsible practice that has been condemned by Parliament in adopting this report. Despite the success of this vote, given the cross-border implications for the safety and health of European citizens, I regret the minor role that Parliament has been given in nuclear matters as it has only a consultative role in this matter. Thanks to an amendment brought by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, this report underlines the need to find a new legal basis for legislation in nuclear matters in order for the interests of European citizens to be better represented on issues that are of such direct concern to them.

 Mr President, the debate on the European Union’s financial perspective raises questions about the European project, its scope and its ambition. This report is laudable because it seeks to mobilise the Union’s budgetary resources in order to comply with the Europe 2020 strategy. This puts it at odds with the narrow vision of most Member States. Whereas Member States see Europe in terms of their financial contribution, which they want to see reduced, and the financial returns, which they want to see increased, this report argues in favour of strong and integrated Community policies, be they long-established policies or new competences under the Treaty of Lisbon. Consequently, this own-initiative report by Parliament should form the basis for future discussions, even if, in my view, it does err on the side of consensus and caution. It is true that a 5% increase in the European budget would be better than the Member States’ budgetary plans for 2012. However, the crux of the matter – and probably the stumbling block – will be agreeing a figure that tallies with the policies described in the report. We are aware of the downsides of austerity policies: how they affect employment and have left growing numbers of citizens despairing. We have a responsibility to finance countercyclical policies, not least through a strong cohesion policy, Mr Pieper, which promotes public investment and employment in all European regions. I would like to stress the importance of creating an intermediate regions category to ensure that the allocation of Structural Funds accurately reflects economic and social realities in the regions. Let me conclude by saying that we need to impose a tax on financial speculation, which would increase our citizens’ support for a well-financed Europe. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 With the adoption of the Garriga report on the political and budgetary challenges facing the European Union after 2013, Parliament is anticipating, much too timidly in my view, the debate to come on the future financial prospects of the Union. This report reiterates its opposition to pitting against each other the different policies that fall within EU competence and insists on the need to mobilise sufficient funds, consistent with the EU 2020 strategy. It sends a clear message to Member States: we intend to support strong integrated policies and to do this by increasing the budget by at least 5%. Furthermore, in a context where citizens are subjected to austerity, we must maintain a strong cohesion policy. That is what we propose in this report, with support for the plan to create an intermediate category of regions, which will enable a distribution of Structural Funds that is more in accordance with the real economic and social situations of our territories. Finally, the Union must grant itself financial resources that match its ambitions. We have therefore reiterated our desire to introduce a tax on financial transactions, a project which is widely supported by the public and which would encourage greater support on their part for the European project.

 This resolution was adopted following the proposal by the Commission aimed at opening the negotiations on renewing the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Mauritania. Voting in favour of a resolution is unfortunately the only thing Parliament can do to be heard in the negotiations of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA). At present, Parliament can only have its say once the negotiations have ended, which leaves it no other option than to either approve these agreements or reject their ratification, thus leaving it very little room for manoeuvre. Now, the Treaties stipulate that Parliament be ‘immediately and fully informed at all stages of the procedure’. Hence, it is essential and legitimate that we ask to be associated with the European Commission and Council during these negotiations. This issue is not new and raises regular questioning of the European Commission by the members of the Committee on Fisheries. It is regrettable that we are not able to make binding our opinion on our priorities relating to the provision of European funds to the countries concerned, in spite of the fact that Parliament has the power to exercise financial control.

The adoption of a Parliament resolution on the European fisheries sector crisis due to the rise in oil prices is an opportunity for me to remind you how urgent it is for us to come to the aid of fishermen. In a context where recruitment is becoming more and more difficult, and where the practices that fishermen must adopt continue to become ever more restrictive, the increase in fuel prices makes conditions even more difficult in this crisis-hit sector. The substantial increase in oil prices is having a strong impact on fishermen’s operational costs, and this caused their revenue to fall between 2008 and 2010. As the elected representative of a port town, it is all the more incumbent on me to call on the Commission to authorise an increase in the ceiling of the de minimis
 aid. This measure would relieve the pressure on fishermen, thereby enabling them to make a decent living from their work without hindering the replenishment of stocks. The upcoming reform of the common fisheries policy will have to gain the support of fishermen. To show them today that the European Union is alert to their needs would be a good start.

 Following recent events which have highlighted the potential abuses of lobbying, it has appeared all the more necessary to increase transparency regarding the work of interest groups at the European institutions. The merging of the lists of lobbyists registered at the Parliament and the Commission represents a first step towards compiling an exhaustive register of the lobbies active in Brussels and, subsequently, towards greater citizen access to democratic checks and balances in the decision-making process. I have, however, fought to prevent the offices representing local authorities at the European institutions from being affected by this measure. Indeed, I consider these structures to be the direct product of democratically-elected bodies (town, departmental, regional councils, etc.). They represent the general interest, and should therefore be distinguished from lobbyists who defend individual interests. Furthermore, I hope that this register will develop to become mandatory one day, and include all lobbyists who are active at the European institutions. The notion of transparency is crucial to European Union policy and it must be extended to cover all interest groups that participate in its operation. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, EU fishermen are, as we know, confronted with three major problems: firstly, the very complex, unpopular quota system has forced them to adopt very restrictive practices. Secondly, the lack of training opportunities and the profession’s perceived loss of prestige are causing significant recruitment problems. Thirdly, and this is the issue we are discussing today, the rise in oil prices is making operating conditions in this crisis-hit sector even more difficult. Between 2008 and 2010, French fishermen, for example, lost EUR 100-200 in income per week as a result of fluctuating oil prices, even though their turnover remained the same. As an elected representative from a port town, I strongly support my fellow Members in demanding that the Commission authorise an increase in the de minimis
 aid ceilings. This measure would relieve the pressure on fishermen, thereby enabling them to make a decent living from their work. However, contrary to what has also been said, it would not affect the replenishment of stocks. The future reform of the common fisheries policy will have to seek the support of fishermen. To show them today, on Europe Day in particular, that the European Union is alert to their needs would already be a good start, Commissioner. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European food aid programme for the most deprived persons in the EU was urgently introduced during the exceptionally cold winter of 1986, then enshrined the following year in the common agricultural policy. This programme has become vital for 13 million Europeans who have little job security. It eases the strain on their food budget through distributions by charities and social services, and adds up to a mere EUR 1 per European per year in aid. Together with the Federation of Food Banks, Secours populaire
, the Red Cross and Restos du Coeur
 in France, I am concerned about the future of this programme after the European Court of Justice called into question its funding within the framework of the CAP. Our Parliament has often emphasised the fundamental nature of the right to food. Our institutions made 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. To cite legal ambiguity as an excuse for dismantling, as some Member States are trying to do, a food aid programme that has proved its worth would be disastrous not only for the people concerned but also for Europe’s credibility and image. That is why I call on the Commission to take the political measures necessary to safeguard, preserve and strengthen that programme. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 The parliamentary resolution on the lessons to be drawn from the nuclear accident in Japan contained some very positive points with regard to the safety of power plants, recommending, for example, ‘stress tests’ carried out in a coordinated manner at EU level by independent bodies working in accordance with the most exacting standards and completely transparently. Furthermore, like everyone else in the French socialist delegation, I supported the amendments in favour of a carefully planned and prepared phasing-out of nuclear power, reflecting the fight against global warming. That phasing-out of nuclear power will have to go hand in hand with increased investment in research and innovation, in order to reduce our energy dependence and increase the number of renewable forms of energy in the energy mix of the EU Member States. I did, however, vote against the motion as a whole, because it was merely a juxtaposition of viewpoints forming an inconsistent motion. After such a disastrous event as Fukushima, the question of the future of a sector as sensitive as nuclear energy requires more than a hastily put together resolution. We will now have to take the time necessary to organise a genuinely constructive debate, addressing all of the associated issues while enabling everyone to voice his or her opinion.

 I voted in favour of this report on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in support of the food industry employees (UNILEVER) in the Czech Republic. I would stress, however, that there is an urgent need to review the regulation of that fund as soon as possible. To this end, during the vote I co-signed and secured the adoption of an amendment specifying that it is detrimental for the regulation not to require an investigation into the financial health, possible tax evasion or state aid situation of multinationals which benefit from the intervention of the EGF. At a time when the European Union is struggling to finance its objectives and is obliged to choose between policies of equally high priority, the Community budget cannot afford to fund the market entry and relocation strategies of large multinational companies whose sole intention is to increase their profits. This must be taken into account in the forthcoming regulation, without prejudicing redundant workers by compromising their access to the EGF. Estelle Grelier,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their committed and constructive participation in the work done by the Committee on Fisheries on this report on transitional technical measures. The report has aroused lively debate, given the huge significance of the technical measures, as they will influence the way fishermen and the sector as a whole do their work, by setting out the methods fishermen may use to catch fish in the zones covered by this regulation, with a view to protecting juveniles and restoring stocks: an aim shared by all, and by fishermen in particular. The subject of this report is sensitive and controversial, as demonstrated by the difficulties the Commission has come up against since 2008 in trying to reach an agreement with the Council on the future of these measures. This was when only those two institutions were involved in the procedure. At present, technical measures are governed by an old regulation that was amended by a succession of transitional measures and then renewed until 30 June 2011 as no agreement was reached with the Council on the Commission’s 2008 proposal for a new regulation, which was aimed at simplifying and clarifying the existing legislation to ensure the rules were implemented more effectively and to cater for the fisheries’ regional features. Today, as the new deadline approaches the situation is radically different. Since the Treaty of Lisbon, for the most part the subject of fisheries now falls under the ordinary legislative procedure, whereby Parliament has an important part to play as co-legislator. It fully intends to play its part by bringing the fishermen’s points of view and those of EU policy-makers closer together. As an elected representative from a port town, I am always struck by how the fishing sector mistrusts and sees itself as remote from the common fisheries policy (CFP), whereas farmers for example clearly feel themselves to be more a part of the common agricultural policy. Added to this, the fishing sector is in crisis. There is growing dissatisfaction. The real challenge is the balance that must be found between the sector’s economic stability and hence the guarantee of decent incomes for fishermen and the sustainability and replenishment of fish stocks. Finally, the expiration of the regulation comes at a time when talks on the reform of the common fisheries policy are starting. This reform must adopt a bold framework and must get the fishing community, consumers and citizens on board. It must involve the whole sector in the scientific analyses that form the basis for the quotas and hence the sector’s level of activity. This new framework presupposes that the Commission will draw up a concrete proposal on the future technical measures, an effort which at present both it and the Council appear to have been saving themselves. The new proposal must make provision to ensure that the technical measures are in keeping with real experience on the ground, through consultation with those working in the sector. It must also be in keeping with the new regulation and the framework of the new CFP, especially on the subject of regional variations in measures. It must ensure that the division of jurisdiction between the Commission and Member States is clearly defined, a factor which will aid understanding and ownership of this EU policy. In the light of this background and these issues, I propose that we agree to the Commission’s request for an extension until 31 December 2012, without substantially changing the current technical measures except for the addition regarding the permissible mesh size for boarfish. However, I realise that this proposal is a form of concession to the Commission and that there are a lot of questions being asked and a strong demand for change in the sector, which is disappointed that this important project has been postponed. I am therefore adding a twofold demand to our approval: a request for an impact assessment on the technical measures currently in force, which is vital if we are to adapt them effectively, and a request for genuine consultation with all of the parties involved, especially fishermen themselves, in drawing up the new regulation. To conclude, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the Commission’s new proposal should be made within a reasonable timescale for a new regulation to come into force on 1 January 2013, which is when the new CFP comes into force. It is vital that the Commission begin work immediately on this new proposal. It would be unreasonable to allow a further extension after this new 18-month extension period for the current regulation. The technical measures to which my report relates are transitional and have only been approved as such. Estelle Grelier,

 Mr President, I will do my best to speak more slowly – I promise.  (FR)
 Mr President, I would like to thank my fellow Members for their generally favourable comments on this report, which also echo the debates that took place during the meetings in the Committee on Fisheries. I share the Commissioner’s standpoint on accepting the amendment specifying the mesh size for boarfish nets and on not agreeing to any specific requests for amendments to certain technical measures, on the grounds that they are not supported by any impact assessments for the vessels and the ecosystems concerned, or because the Member States have not sent the necessary scientific data. These measures are all interconnected and have not been evaluated. I would like to stress, as previous speakers have done this evening, the urgency for the Commission to carry out an evaluation of the current measures as quickly as possible and on the basis of this evaluation to draw up a new proposal that can be dealt with at the same time as the reform of the common fisheries policy, rather than after it. I wanted to draw your attention to this point, Commissioner, and I note your readiness to speed up the drafting of the proposal. To conclude, I must mention once again the importance of joint work between the EU institutions and the fisheries sector on gathering and sharing the scientific data. I believe this is a necessary basis for a new, fair and collaborative common fisheries policy which has sufficient resources – and that is an important point – and which reconciles the economic necessities and the sustainability of the sector in the interests of all: the fishing community, consumers and citizens.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Balzani, for the consistency of her draft resolution on the general guidelines for the 2012 budget. This resolution sends a clear political message. It is because it is fully aware of the budgetary constraints affecting the European Union that Parliament is today calling for the adoption of a 2012 budget that can respond to the political, economic and social challenges we currently face. At a time when the sole topic of discussion among the Member States is the implementation of additional austerity measures, Parliament, at least on this side of the House, intends to demonstrate its commitment to the thousands of workers who, today, are marching through the streets of Brussels to show their rejection of these economically questionable and socially unjust measures, the result of which will be a further increase in structural unemployment in Europe. The fact that the European budget is being aligned with the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy, in a clear way for the first time in 2012, means that employment and growth can be put back at the heart of European policies, which I would point out are our priorities, since the EU 2020 Strategy has set the objective of an employment rate of 75% of the working population. However, let us not delude ourselves. This budgetary procedure will be a long and difficult one, contrary to what Mr Lewandowski indicated in the French press when he anticipated the position of the MEPs. The Member States have already expressed their short-term view of the budget, which advocates discipline, and have called for a limit on their contribution to financing Community action. They see the European Union and its action not as a means to achieve added value or as a means to help it achieve ambitious policies, but rather as an additional cost. Let us not be mistaken. The 2012 budgetary procedure will provide another insight into the tactics being used to define the future multiannual financial framework. The fact is, with a budget which accounts for a mere 2% of the EU’s public expenditure, it will be difficult to pursue ambitious policies in all sectors. We are already seeing stormy debates on whether it will be the CAP or cohesion policy that will be plundered. This pits citizens against each other when it would be to our credit to help them work in synergy. That is why, Commissioner, I would reiterate the importance of your communication on the implementation of own resources. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D
),

 Here we are at the start of a difficult negotiation between Member States on the 2012 budget while, in the background, the debate is already underway on the post-2013 financial perspectives. At this time of crisis, it will be necessary throughout the budgetary process to reiterate our expectations with regard to European policies. Unlike some Council members who consider the EU to be an additional cost, an expense to be reduced at the risk of pitting current and future policies against each other, Parliament, through the resolution on general guidelines for the preparation of the 2012 budget, has reiterated its vision of the Union as a vector of added value and an ally of Member States in implementing ambitious policies. Furthermore, I voted in favour of the resolution presented by Mrs Balzani because of its consistency and the clear political message it carries, calling for the adoption of a budget that is consistent with the objectives for employment and growth of the EU 2020 Strategy. Finally, I took advantage of the debate in plenary to challenge the Commissioner for Financial Programming and the Budget on the urgent need for a communication on the implementation of new own resources, which, I hope, will carry this debate forward.

 In the absence of other alternative solutions proposed by the Council, it was necessary to vote in favour of making the European stability mechanism permanent, in order to provide assistance to our Greek, Portuguese and Irish colleagues. However, the debate is far from over. This concession made by the French socialists is not an indicator of the outcome of other forthcoming debates on the economic governance issue. Faced with the introduction of this intergovernmental mechanism, it is important to move forward and implement instruments which will encourage recovery in growth and business. It is, among other things, to ensure that we are able to finance such instruments that I am campaigning alongside my socialist colleagues for an increase in the European Union’s own resources. We could also use the Structural Funds in conjunction with the European stability mechanism to make deficit countries converge upwards. It is with ambitious budgets and the promotion of a European social model that we will be able to emerge from the crisis. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 The adoption of a parliamentary resolution on the draft strategy for the Atlantic region is an opportunity for me to point out the urgent need to work at European level on a common approach regarding the use of our maritime areas and to find a joint solution to the problems that exist. The Channel is a particularly illuminating example in this respect: a strategic maritime gateway to the European Union, it is both an essential link between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea (it contains 20% of the world’s fleet and more than 500 vessels over 300 tonnes sail through it every day) and an area dedicated to fishing, leisure activities, aggregate extraction and soon – much to my satisfaction – energy production from offshore wind farms. This concentration of activities calls for serious thought to be given to the issue of managing maritime safety in that area at European level, as part of a joint strategy. That is why, during the debate on the strategy for the Atlantic region, I once again called on Mrs Damanaki, Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, to include the Channel in the proposal that she is due to submit in June.

 The adoption of the Podimata report was the chance for Parliament to show unequivocal support for the introduction of a tax on financial transactions at European level. Until now, the European right had always frustrated the proposals by the socialists on this matter, whether in parliamentary committees or in plenary sessions. The fact that a majority of MEPs, and hence a section of the right, have been won over by this project, which has been advocated for many years by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is good news. It shows that, together, we are gradually becoming aware of the merits of this project. This vote marks a new stage in the process of introducing a financial instrument that would serve, in particular, to generate additional own resources for the EU budget, but also to support development initiatives internationally. However, the fight is not over. For the time being, this is only a policy position. Beyond their statements, we must remain alert to the genuine willingness of European Heads of State or Government, a large majority of whom are right-of-centre, to introduce this tax.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted with these plans for an integrated strategy for the Atlantic region. We need a common approach to the uses of our maritime spaces that takes the specific features of each basin into consideration and finds joint solutions to the problems that exist. In particular, as an elected representative of Normandy, I would like to draw your attention to the specific situation of the Channel, which must also be incorporated into the plans for an integrated strategy for the Atlantic region. The Channel is one of the European Union’s strategic maritime gateways and is an essential link between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea. It contains 20% of the world’s fleet and more than 500 ships over 300 tonnes sail through it every day. On top of this transport activity, there are also fisheries, leisure activities, aggregate extraction and soon – much to my satisfaction – energy production from offshore wind farms. This concentration of activities calls for serious thought to be given to the issue of managing maritime safety at European level, which I feel must be discussed as part of the Atlantic strategy also. As you know, the bilateral bases on which funding for safety is based are currently under threat. I have already alerted you to this point Commissioner and I will be paying close attention to the proposals you will be making in June. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Adopted in 2006, the Services Directive, which should have been transposed into national law before 28 December 2009, continues to raise questions in the Member States and within local authorities that are directly affected by it. The parliamentary own-initiative report by Mrs Gebhardt, which proposes an initial assessment of the directive’s implementation, thus touches on some of these difficulties, and especially the uncertainty surrounding social services and services of general economic interest (how are they defined? which areas are affected?), as well as the lack of transparency of the transposition process in some Member States. Moreover, it must be said that France stands out due to its problematic lack of transparency and inflexibility in implementing this directive. It has scores of decrees and implementing laws, and a restrictive interpretation of the exemptions set out in the directive, which raises doubts as to the future of some services, such as childcare and care for the disabled. Now more than ever, this own-initiative report, which has been adopted by a large majority, is an opportunity to point out that MEPs, and especially the Socialists, will continue to be vigilant with regard to the implementation of this directive and its impact on public services.

The adoption of the Commission’s proposal for a regulation setting emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles seems to me, more than anything, to be a gamble on the future. The compromise reached on limiting average CO2
 emissions to 147 g/km by 2020 does not meet the initial ambitions of my fellow Members on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, who had previously advocated a decidedly more ambitious objective (135 g/km). They were supported in this by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. Behind this ‘battle of numbers’, however, there is a balance to be struck between the environmental challenges that everyone recognises and certain social and industrial requirements which must not be forgotten. That is why it seems appropriate to me that the compromise will be adopted only following the revision of the regulation by January 2013 and only following the feasibility study and reassessment of the objectives. Not only will this revision allow us to return to this subject quickly and to go further in the fight against vehicle pollution, but it will also be an opportunity to address the issue of EU research and innovation in the field of road haulage. The date is set for 2012. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Today’s adoption of the 2011 budget has highlighted the European Parliament’s double failure. The budget that it adopted is too small: +2.91%, which falls far short of its first reading (+6%) and of the Commission’s initial proposal (+5.8%). The amounts adopted are exactly the same as those proposed with no real room for the Council to negotiate, hardly reassuring in terms of the negotiability of future budgets. Ever since the Treaty of Lisbon was implemented, Parliament has acted with the Council in codecision on budgetary matters: by not getting any precise commitment to date on the role that we, as MEPs, will have in preparing the next financial framework and on providing the necessary reflection on new own resources, we run the risk of allowing the Council to become lord and master over the future of the European project. So, given the positioning of certain Member States, there is a real risk that this project will flounder. What dismays me the most is the attitude displayed by the European right as they were more than determined at the start of negotiations to drop out the minute the telephones began ringing from Heads of State or Government. Everyone will make their own mind up about the political consistency of such a reversal. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 In my view, the EU Solidarity Fund, like the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, is one of the budgetary tools that give the strongest practical expression to the ‘solidarity’ value that we Members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament strive to promote when drafting Community policies. On 27 and 28 February 2010, storm Xynthia killed 53 and injured around 80 in Vendée and Charente-Maritime. It was a genuinely traumatic experience for the region and the nation, and its psychological and economic impact is still being felt 10 months later. As from the March 2010 plenary session, Parliament took action, adopting by a very large majority a resolution calling for the fund to be used to provide assistance to the victims. Today’s vote, which confirmed the release of EUR 35.6 million for these departments, as well as EUR 31.2 million for Portugal, which suffered flooding in Madeira caused by this storm, is an example of this common desire to show true solidarity between European citizens. This is the Europe we wish to build, a Europe close to its citizens, alert to the issues affecting them, and capable of addressing those issues collectively. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

We have here a case of coincidental timing: Parliament has been asked to give its opinion today on six requests for European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) assistance that have been submitted by the Netherlands while, at the same time, the 2011 budget negotiations are stalling because of the refusal by the Netherlands and by two other Member States to engage in a responsible and constructive dialogue on the future of the European budget. Today’s votes are therefore, in my view, an opportunity to point out that the European budget is not just an accounting tool that everyone finds daunting: it is, first and foremost, the ‘power’ behind the European Union that enables it to work day in day out to protect its citizens, and particularly through the EGF, to protect unemployed workers. The vote on the allocation of EGF aid to the Dutch workers could have been used as a ‘protest vote’ against the Dutch Government, which is criticising on the one hand what it is benefiting from on the other. Instead, it has been an opportunity for Parliament to recall that the principle of solidarity must be the foundation on which all EU decisions are made. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, as a result of the austerity policy conducted by the Cameron government, the United Kingdom has just decided to stop funding the large tugboats designed to assist and rescue ships in the English Channel, a unilateral decision that has been condemned by the port, maritime, trading and political bodies of that area. The announced withdrawal of the United Kingdom could have tragic repercussions for the maritime safety of this sector, which, with more than 250 000 vessels a year, is the busiest trading route in the world. Over the last 10 years, nearly 300 incidents have been recorded there, and experts believe that the pre-positioning of high-powered salvage vessels has prevented a number of these incidents from turning into major accidents. Since maritime safety affects the safety of EU territory and the protection of the environment, emergency towing is the responsibility of the public authority, with the financial assistance of shipowners, and must not be privatised for the benefit of private towing companies. The European Commission therefore has a duty to take up this matter. Indeed, Europe must afford itself the resources to implement the major integrated maritime policy that it is officially calling for. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 As a Member for a port town in Normandy, and member of the Intergroup for Seas and Coastal Affairs, I have followed the report on the integrated maritime policy (IMP) closely. On various occasions, I have emphasised the need for ensuring harmonious cohabitation between the different uses of the sea, one that promotes traditional activities (such as fishing, and I asked for it to be placed top of the list of maritime activities included in the report, as a symbolic gesture), and one that also facilitates the development of new activities. Thus I noted that the sector of renewable energies, including off-shore wind energy, should be supported in particular, because it is in line with European objectives around the diversification of sources of energy supply, and can, between now and 2020, mean a gain of 410 000 jobs in Europe, according to a study by the Commission. Finally, with the rapporteur, I amended the report to apprise the Commission of the need to fund the IMP. The initial exchanges within the Committee on ‘policy challenges and budgetary resources for after 2013’, of which I am a member, indeed raised doubts about the long-term funding of the regional cohesion policy, some of the programmes of which relate to the IMP.

Once again, Parliament has been asked to validate payment of aid from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to employees made redundant as a result of the crisis or relocations. Once again, this aid will be spread across budgetary lines initially allocated to other European programmes, as the Globalisation Adjustment Fund does not have any funds of its own within the current financial framework. In order to put an end to this situation, I worked, during the drafting of the 2011 budget, on the creation of a line of payment appropriations specific to the Globalisation Adjustment Fund. The sum of EUR 50 million was therefore adopted by Parliament during the vote on its reading of the budget on 20 October 2010. This sum, which is symbolic compared with annual requirements, has yet to be confirmed, as the European Council initially rejected the proposal to give the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund its own financing. I shall therefore continue to keep an eye on this question, in the hope of achieving budgetary and legislative consolidation of this mechanism. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as our debate again shows, we are all in agreement on one thing: the more Europe enlarges, the greater the powers entrusted to it, the more it displays its ambitions and the fewer resources it has to bring them to fruition. So everyone agrees on the diagnosis, but clearly we are not in agreement about what we need to do to extricate ourselves from this financial deadlock. As what was short-term has lasted, the Union budget has become a prisoner of national contributions, which make up almost 75% of its resources. Today, if we decided to raise the expenditure ceiling to the maximum threshold allowed by the treaties, this would mean an additional levy of more than 5 billion for countries like France and Germany. Everyone here clearly agrees that this is not possible. It is not a question of stepping up discipline, as it is the people and, principally, the poorest people who pay the highest price for the consequences of these national austerity policies. Considering that the financial sector bears the main responsibility for the crisis and explosion in public debt, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament proposes that a line of ‘own resources’ should be created funded by a financial transactions tax; this proposal was rejected within the Committee on Budgets by the right, which may make up for it tomorrow and bring its actions into line with the numerous statements they have made to the media in favour of this measure. It is a little more than two years since the fall of Lehman Brothers, and Parliament must not pass up an historic opportunity to create the foundations for a new development model, based on more lasting resources and certainly ones that are more just in terms of redistribution of wealth and solidarity. For the first budget voted on under the Treaty of Lisbon, this would send a strong political signal from our Parliament, which does not intend to make do with using its new codecision powers to manage penury, that is, to choose which of Peter or Paul is to go without clothing. Giving oneself the means, starting tomorrow, to increase the size of the Union budget, is to give oneself the means to pursue ambitious economic recovery, research, industrial, and employment policies. Let us not fail to grasp this opportunity that European citizens expect of us and which, in any case, the financial operators are expecting of us. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

I voted for Mrs Matera’s report on mobilising the Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the workers of the clothing industry in Spain. As I said in September during the debate on the EGF’s future after 2013, I am disappointed that this fund, set up to support workers made redundant ‘for reasons of recession or globalisation’, is currently not financially guaranteed in the European budget. Indeed, I do not believe that tapping into the financial resources of other European programmes to finance the EGF is a viable solution in the long run. Therefore, when the Committee on Budgets voted for mobilising the EGF for the Spanish employees mentioned in the Matera report, I pointed out, along with the Belgian Socialist MEP Mr Daerden, the need to work towards defining a separate budget heading for this funding. What is at stake here is the European Union’s credibility in supporting citizens affected by economic instability. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in brief, what does the European Commission’s proposal convey? First, a glaring lack of ambition. The Commission, supported by the Council, has refused to revise the multiannual financial framework, and has salved its conscience by proposing technical adjustments only – adjustments that were, in any case, inevitable, since they relate to the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon. Second, a breach of the undertakings given to Parliament. In fact, and this must be said, in 2006, Parliament accepted, albeit half-heartedly, what it had already, and quite rightly, understood to be an out-of-date financial framework, without room for manoeuvre; in short, one of resignation. It therefore made its support conditional on the guarantee of an in-depth overhaul of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) at the half-way stage. A fine demonstration of the lack of importance that the Commission and the Council attach to Parliament’s decisions, in paying no regard to them whatsoever – a Parliament, it must be remembered, that is sovereign and represents the people. Third, this proposal lays bare a paradox, namely one of increased powers, entrusted by the States to the Union, of large-scale projects, preferably European, within a budgetary framework that the Council and the Commission will not allow to evolve, even though they know it is not fit for purpose. They prefer to call on redeployment – a miracle cure in their eyes, but to mine, a narrow vision of the European project. What is more, how can we explain to the people of Europe without blushing that key projects are either not financed at all, such as the financial stabilisation mechanism, despite its heavy media coverage, or financed like the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), by tapping into heading 1a, which is intended for competitiveness, growth and employment, all policies meeting the public’s expectations? We are heading straight for the wall, while sounding the horn. Parliament knows it, and it is one of the virtues of the Böge report that it says so. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 I have supported this joint motion for a resolution because I am convinced that we urgently need to condemn the policy of the French Government, which has deliberately stigmatised an ethnic group by associating it directly with criminality, for the sole purpose of diverting attention away from the difficulties with its home affairs policy. This exploitation of the Roma issue is unacceptable in my view, and Parliament ought to react. Progressive Members, including the Social Democrats, have therefore demanded an end to this discriminatory rhetoric and to the collective expulsions, whereas the European right wing has largely supported the French Government in its drift to the right. We urgently need to implement a global strategy to tackle this subject, which affects 10-12 million EU citizens. This resolution deplores the lack of any reaction from the Commission, which is, however, supposed to be the guardian of the Treaties and as such should have condemned the French Government’s actions. The collective expulsions effectively make a mockery of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.

 I voted for the Portas Report. I support its main aim, which is to continue with the EGF, since, aside from the crisis we are going through, globalisation has a long-term adverse impact for our industrial jobs, which the European right refuses to accept. Furthermore, I helped amend this text so that SMEs and sub-contractors are taken into consideration when the EGF is allocated. Their employees are particularly vulnerable due to their dependence on multinationals, so it is vital that the EGF gives them real prospects for vocational retraining in the event of redundancy. I am also pleased that it has been recognised that studies need to be performed on the state bodies responsible for producing dossiers, so as to optimise utilisation of the EGF, which is often little-known and underused, particularly in France. Given that the European right has refused to continue the EGF after 2013, I will therefore fight in the debate on the next EU financial perspective for it to be kept permanently. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, it is a pity that the European budget, which should be a symbol of solidarity and the will to act together, has become a rigid tool, which the citizens do not understand and which lags behind the expectations of European society, incapable of being deployed to fight the social repercussions of the crisis. From this point of view, not a day passes without the media or a top-ranking politician talking about the need for a stronger European budget. Tension is increasing between revenue that is too modest, too dependent on the contributions of the Member States, and the money that the Union needs to spend in order to kick-start growth. For example, in the draft budget for 2011, the Commission simply presents a margin for manoeuvre of EUR 50 million to support new projects linked to employment and corporate competitiveness, which are top priorities. The revision of the financial framework is therefore a serious challenge for the future of the Union if we want to make it a real political and economic leader and also, and above all, a player that is closer to its citizens at a time when nearly 25 million of them are affected by unemployment. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Mr President, in essence, the vote on the budget is a profoundly political act, and we must learn a political lesson – a major, fundamental political lesson – from the budget being proposed to us. The European Union budget, and particularly this one, reflects the lack of a European political project even though, against a backdrop of crisis and at the start of our new mandates, European citizens need it more than ever. This budget marks the absence of a global vision for Europe. The Council and the Commission have chosen to let the Member States develop their own, often rival, recovery plans, and have abandoned efforts to coordinate an economic, social and environmental recovery at EU level. There has been no leverage attempt, no encouraging of European solidarity. The Council and the Commission are easing their consciences by applying a recovery plan bit by bit. Indeed, the 2010 budget provides funding for the second part of the recovery plan totalling EUR 5 billion, a derisory amount. Admittedly, it will allocate EUR 300 million to the milk fund, but this is insufficient when we know that in France, for example, the net income of farmers fell by 34% in 2009. The 2010 budget earmarks EUR 25 million for microfinance and, against the advice of the Council, allows the draft budget relating to Cohesion Fund interventions to be kept. It is therefore somewhat through the lack of an alternative and by default that we shall vote for this budget, because Europe – the citizens – cannot do without its interventions, however inadequate. Nevertheless, together, we must question – and this is urgent – the methods of financing the ambitious policies with which Europe must equip itself and of extracting the EU budget from its current restricted and unsuitable framework. Above and beyond major political declarations, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, must tell us how he intends to finance the future European policies about which he talks so much, particularly those relating to the new strategy on growth and to climate change. From now on they will be unable to make do with such a feeble budget as the one we are being offered. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, as an MEP from Normandy, I would like to draw the Commission’s and Parliament’s attention to the proposals on offshore Natura 2000 sites, which the French Government has just submitted to the European authorities. These proposals exclude the Antifer dyke situated near Etretat, but compensate for it by enlarging the perimeter to 12 nautical miles. This decision eases the way for Poweo to install a methane terminal at Antifer and restricts a project to create an offshore wind farm off Fécamp, despite the support shown for this project by local elected representatives, the population and even fishermen. A scientific and consistent proposal has been drafted for the region and has the backing of local operators. Under this proposal there will be six miles of zoning along the entire coastline, including Antifer. I have three questions: how much progress has the Commission made in examining the zoning proposals? Does it endorse them even though they go against scientific opinions and against the social, economic and cultural activities of the region? And, with the Copenhagen Summit approaching, can Europe reasonably endorse a decision that promotes gas at the expense of the development of renewable energies? Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 I voted against this appointment. France is preparing to make crucial progress on equal rights by adopting a law on marriage for all, at last joining several other Member States who have done the same. I believe that Tonio Borg’s appointment would contradict that progress in France and in Europe. His proposed portfolio – European Commissioner for Health – is fundamentally incompatible with his past statements and actions on contraception, abortion, and homosexual and transsexual rights. The holder of this position is meant to work for all European citizens, irrespective of their sex and their sexual orientation. Against a backdrop of particularly vicious comments and acts by extremists in France, appointing Tonio Borg would mean that Europe can accommodate such deviations. It is clear to all French Socialists that fundamental rights are not a matter for subsidiarity: they are universal. Irrespective of competence, this is an ethical matter: the European citizens have the right to expect Europe and the European Commissioners to defend these values without fail.

 In the opinion of the French Socialists, the national and European laws must be extremely strict, for example on extraction by hydraulic fracturing –the only type we are currently aware of – in order prevent any damage to the environment. It is not a question of denying the importance of energy independence and the effect of energy prices on the competitiveness of industry. Our priority must be to guarantee a high level of protection for human health and the environment. I regret that an amendment that I co-signed, calling for a European moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, did not obtain a majority today. Despite this setback, I welcome the action of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, which was crucial in ensuring the primacy of two particularly important principles: the precautionary principle and the ‘polluter pays’ principle.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to draw your attention to the case of Aurore Martin, the French citizen arrested in Spain and handed over to the Spanish authorities who is serving a 12-year prison sentence. Her crime consists in having participated in Spain in meetings of the Batasuna party, a party that is illegal in Spain but legal in France where it even has some elected representatives. She is the subject of a European arrest warrant that has been enforced. Although the establishment of the European arrest warrant in 2004 was greeted as the first step towards a European area of security and justice, today there are differences in its implementation that create inequalities between citizens of the European Union, and that is contrary to the very spirit of the framework decision establishing the European arrest warrant. Moreover, where there are important political implications, as in the case of this Basque activist, shouldn’t the European arrest warrant include broader exceptions and not be issued automatically so as to provide a better guarantee of fundamental rights, including the freedom of expression, which has been prejudiced in the case of Aurore Martin?

 Our votes have shown that the majority of Members did not favour transferable fishing concessions (TFCs) aimed at liberalising the fishing industry. The adopted text still, unfortunately, makes reference to TFCs, but they are now optional. A more watered-down position has also been adopted on the compulsory landing of discards; what is currently under consideration is a gradual implementation on a case-by-case basis, taking account of the different characteristics and realities of the fisheries. While the landing of all incidental catches and by-catches was to be approved in the basic regulation, we have also achieved the guarantee of financial compensation for fishing professionals in the text on the common market organisation. Finally, a compromise was reached in relation to maximum sustainable yield, so that this rate could be applied at the latest in 2020, and not in 2015. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 Parliament has today approved a directive on energy efficiency that should enable us to aim for energy savings of 20% by 2020, which represents considerable progress. I particularly welcome the fact that the directive specifies a series of compulsory measures that contribute to the goal of energy efficiency. These include renovating public buildings, a strategy to encourage investment in renovating housing stock and commercial premises, cogeneration, energy saving certificates, and so on. The Commission has also agreed to publish a list of additional sectoral initiatives in order to ensure that the overall target of 20% energy savings by 2020 is really achieved. The course has been set; it is now up to Member States to implement this directive as quickly as possible. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

We must detect, assess and prevent the undesirable effects of medicines that are put on the market in the European Union, and we must do so at European level. Following the Mediator affair, the Commission implemented a ‘stress test’ which allowed us to identify weaknesses in current legislation. The present revisions are the result of this process. The improvements made today are numerous: most notably, the introduction of an automatic urgent procedure, the creation of a new trigger mechanism for the urgent procedure and the clarification of the transparency obligation of companies. The European regulation marks a significant step towards increased health security for Europeans, and we welcome that. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 I voted against this useless and dangerous text, whose only worth is that it has instigated pan-European debate and highlighted the democratic checks in place in Europe to tackle the relentless lobbying of some of the large multinationals. Today, not only have we voted against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), we have actually voted for European democracy. Showing little regard for the EU’s Treaties, citizens and democratic principles, the Commission has been negotiating the ACTA behind Parliament’s back since 2007. The exploitation of the Court of Justice of the European Union is just the latest blatant disregard for the democratic balance which we at the European Parliament uphold.

 Earlier today, we voted in favour of the general introduction of eCall, an in-vehicle emergency call system. This system, which is public and open, could contribute significantly to reducing the road death toll. That is why we have been advocating it since 2003. Unfortunately, for commercial reasons, car manufacturing lobbies want to impose private optional systems, which was supported by France’s former government which did not wish to invest in the scheme, and by several French MEPs from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Saving a life does indeed have a financial cost, but it is our duty as European law makers to show that, with a high-performance safety system, the EU can and must protect citizens. We are now waiting for the Commission to propose legislation quickly so that the system can become operational throughout the European Union by 2015. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

Mr President, at this time, many things have been said. Commissioner, I should personally like to express my most heartfelt thanks. Thanks to your stubbornness, your craftiness with regard to procedure, you have given us the opportunity to prove how important Parliament is as colegislator. Thank you, Commissioner, for having driven hundreds of thousands of citizens out into the streets to protest and 2.8 million people to sign petitions. They have discovered that democracy is played out here, that European elected representatives are the representatives of the people, their representatives. Thank you again for the millions of Internet users who have followed the debates and the votes in committee and who are still following us today. I would like to welcome them. It is a breath of fresh air in our institutions, which are all too often perceived as technocratic. Thank you, Commissioner, but in democracy, there is also another principle. It is the fundamental principle, the principle of responsibility. Tomorrow, we will take responsibility and I should like, tomorrow, to be able to thank you for also taking responsibility for your failure, the failure of your working method.

 Madam President, we will be holding a debate on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) tomorrow, but I wanted to raise an issue this evening which, although peripheral to the subject, I feel is extremely important. I am referring to what Commissioner De Gucht told the Committee on International Trade at its meeting on Wednesday 20 June. I quote: ‘If you decide on a ‘no’ vote before the European Court of Justice has handed down its ruling, let me tell you that the Commission will nonetheless continue with the proceedings currently before the Court. We have committed to this. A ‘no’ vote will not halt the proceedings before the Court of Justice’. Not only do his words disregard the treaties, in my view, but, above all, and this is what I want to condemn, they demonstrate an unacceptable disregard for the European Parliament, for democracy in general, and for the voters we represent.

 Today, Parliament has adopted a proposal for a regulation on food intended for infants and young children and on food for special medical purposes. We socialists are delighted to have achieved a strengthening of the provisions on food intended for vulnerable people, stricter rules on composition and labelling and a framework for food being placed on the market. Another important advancement we have achieved is the creation of a single list at EU level specifying the vitamins and minerals that may be added to foods. My only reservation is that the draft legislation excluded ‘growing milks’ used for children aged one to three. For the socialists, it is important that dairy products intended for young children are also covered by this legislation. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 Parliament has expressed its view on the implementation of the proposals contained in the Single Market Act. By way of a reminder, in April 2011, the Commission presented 50 actions to be carried out by 2014 to build a single market focused on the citizens. In line with the socialists’ amendments to the resolution, I condemn the tenor of the Commission’s recent legislative proposals and communications: a very liberal vision is revealed in the Commission’s proposals, which focus on facilitating business to the detriment of measures aimed at jobs and the citizens. I welcome the fact that Parliament has supported the priorities held by the socialists, such as the rejection of social dumping, the promotion of quality jobs, defence of the social protection model, the fight against tax evasion, but also an ambitious growth initiative based on the social market economy.

 At a time when the Council ought to be discussing a growth initiative, along with the other weighty issues, we need to bear in mind Europeans’ main expectation: keeping a job or finding a new one. The social situation is getting more difficult every day. We are facing the threat of a lost generation: 5.6 million young people are unemployed, that is one young European out of every five. We socialists welcome the Commission’s new attitude towards several issues, such as the minimum wage, which, until now, have been taboo.

 The PIP breast implants scandal – which broke in March 2010 – has brought to light the serious malfunctions in European health safety. These tragedies are forcing us to carry out an in-depth review of the functioning of the European and national bodies responsible for health matters. Parliament’s reaction is in line with the gravity of the scandal: the resolution, which I voted for, calls for greater cooperation between Member States and greater control measures for medical devices placed on the market. This is an ambitious resolution in my view, as it also calls on the Commission to consider a system of pre-market authorisation for certain categories of medical devices. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this text, which reviews the scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP). The European Union has granted trade preferences to developing countries since 1971. These provisions are regularly adapted to take account of each country’s economic growth. Today’s vote is the first review of this system under the codecision procedure. In fact, we could barely have hoped for the compromise agreed with the Council, given the vastly differing positions of the Member States. For French Socialists, this text succeeds on two key issues: ensuring that the large emerging countries no longer benefit from preferential access to the EU market and facilitating exports from the poorest countries. This new trade regime will therefore enable us to provide better support to developing countries and it will be a step forward in our fight for fair trade as it will officially exclude the emerging countries almost entirely.

 I voted for the adoption of the Podimata report on the introduction of a financial transaction tax (FTT). Since the current crisis was brought on by stock market and financial speculation, I therefore consider it logical and just that this tax is finally introduced. The latest Eurobarometer survey shows that 66% of Europeans are in favour of such a tax. Furthermore, the FTT and the new resources to which it leads must contribute to financing growth in Europe. From this perspective, we must defend a tax base that is as broad as possible and fight against exemptions and loopholes which would favour speculators. In this regard, I regret the overcautiousness of the European right wing, which preferred to exclude pension funds, as if that financial instrument could not, like any other financial instrument, be at the service of speculation!

 I voted for the adoption of this report, which calls for the establishment of more balanced and fairer trade relations between the European Union and China, because I take the view that globalisation must not be based on unfair competition. The aim of this text is to urge China, the second-biggest trading partner of the European Union, to respect not only the principle of reciprocity in terms of trade, but also the principles of balance and compliance with social and environmental standards. Furthermore, it is necessary to rebalance access to China’s internal market to bring it into line with that of the EU, which is much more open and transparent. That is why the EU must establish a genuine strategy to promote ‘fair trade’ and to protect its industries and some of its sectors from social and environmental dumping, which is practised by some of its partners, most notably China.

 I voted in favour of the compromise text, negotiated with the Council, on the ‘roaming’ regulation, which will mean Europeans pay less to use their mobile phones abroad. As the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, we have called for the removal of these artificial borders within the internal market because they go against the very spirit of the European project and its founding fathers. That is why we urged the Commission to act quickly to effectively end roaming from 2016. As well as applying lower mobile roaming tariffs than those currently being charged from July, the text introduces, for the first time ever, structural solutions that will enable consumers to freely choose another operator for roaming services, separately from their domestic operator, from July 2014.

 I voted against this agreement. Although the fight against terrorism is a major challenge for the European Union as it is for its partners, we believe that it should not be pursued at the expense of the fundamental freedoms of citizens. However, this compromise, far from respecting the principle of proportionality, did not offer sufficient progress in terms of protecting privacy to persuade me to support it. All the more so as it appears to be difficult to gauge how effective the control and data storage measures are in the face of terrorist acts which are frequently not very sophisticated. Furthermore, while these data should strictly only be used as part of the fight against terrorism, in reality the purposes for which they can be used are very broad and very ill-defined. The retention period, the need for anonymisation and deletion, as well as the right of access, correction and deletion for the citizens concerned, are also important reasons for my rejection of this agreement. As Ms Guillaume pointed out, this is an unfortunate situation because this agreement should, on the contrary, have provided the opportunity to ensure that high data protection standards prevail, as behoves the European Union.

All local authorities must be able to use the management method of their choice. On this subject, many people are strongly criticising the European Union, its institutions and in particular the Commission for being responsible for privatisations, but we must remember that, at present, there is no compulsory European ‘internal market’ directive, as is the case for other public service networks.

Madam President, Commissioner, I am joining my colleagues to call for the issue of collective management societies to be dealt with quickly. I agree with the proposals you have just made regarding the harmonisation of horizontal rules on transparency and regarding the rules on online music. However, I must insist on the aim of fair remuneration for artists. Since the start of the mandate, for several years even, the issue of remuneration for artists has been mentioned exclusively in the context of infringements to intellectual property rights, making Internet users the scapegoats for artists’ lack of earnings. Yet, we are forgetting that, for each CD, for example, authors and performers only receive, on average, 6% of the sales price and that, for websites that sell music online, they receive hardly anything, around 1% per sale. Fair remuneration for artists must therefore be at the heart of our revision of collective management for the digital era. Of course, we need more transparency. In France, the Standing Monitoring Committee for management societies and distribution of rights published a damning report last year on the remuneration of the managers of these societies, for example. This committee also denounced a wave of invoices and deductions for costs. Artists must be at the heart of our concerns and many voices from all of the political camps together are denouncing a system which, in the end, places more importance on intermediaries than artists — that is what Neelie Kroes said — or even an opaque, confiscatory system as the French Minister of Culture has branded it. Commissioner, I therefore think that, if we revise these collective management rights, our objective and our end goal must be the optimal perception of intellectual property rights. These are conditions which are not merely incidental in the fight against infringements to intellectual property rights but which represent an essential prerequisite to the respect of these rights by users.

 I abstained. As my colleague, Estelle Grelier, so rightly said, this 2012 budget is, in fact, a Council budget, with just a ‘bit of soul’ added by the European Parliament. We are not fooled by the Council’s ploy: the Member States’ main preoccupation is to impose austerity, but they will not openly admit to the impact that this choice will have on EU policies on the ground. In order to cope with the recession that European citizens are enduring, while States are having trouble funding themselves and austerity policies abound, we need an EU budget that will meet this challenge at the very least, and allow us to implement policies for regeneration. Employment and growth in Europe are at stake. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 Today the European Parliament adopted the ‘economic governance’ package, after lengthy negotiations. For us, French and European socialists, it represents an austerity pact that prevents the Member States from kick-starting the economy and protecting themselves from the markets. In the end, only the proposals made by our colleague Elisa Ferreira will enable us to deliver specific solutions to the macroeconomic imbalances that undermine the sustainability and social bases of the euro area.

 The introduction of this common platform of rights for all consumers within the Union represents a real step forward for the citizens of other countries where consumer information requirements are not as high and where the period for withdrawal is less well protected. However, it has given mixed results, as the aim of the Commission and the European right has been above all to facilitate cross-border trade, and not to harmonise upwards consumer protection. It is therefore a small step for the French consumer but a big step for the European consumer. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 We, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialist and Democrats in the European Parliament, introduced radical changes to the draft produced by the German conservative rapporteur of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), regarded by many as woefully inadequate, and we succeeded in obtaining a majority in the European Parliament on the objective of a fairer allocation of agricultural payments. The abolition of historical reference values, aid to farmers with small farms, a rebalancing in favour of the livestock sector and, above all, the adoption of the principle of the degressivity of direct payments, taking employment and the environment into account, represent crucial progress in this regard. I welcome the work carried out, which will also have made it possible to put in place tools committing agriculture to move towards more sustainable development, while taking into account the objectives of food security, the environment, territories and jobs. The greening of payments of the first pillar will also make it possible to encourage farmers to adopt good farming practices and to be more economically and ecologically efficient. Dacian Cioloş, Member of the European Commission responsible for Agriculture and Rural Development, must now use this report to put forward some good proposals by the end of this year.

 I voted in favour of the report. Some Member States, including France, Germany and the Netherlands, want to change the rules of the game. However it is not reasonable to add other criteria such as an assessment of policies on combating corruption and crime. These issues are undoubtedly important, but the proposal is purely politically motivated. Adding new criteria would create a two-tier system for the Member States. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this report. The great virtue of this report is to seek to mobilise all the EU’s budgetary resources in a coherent fashion and as a means to achieve the Europe 2020 strategy, and to take a stand that is diametrically opposed to the narrow approach of most Member States. While these Members bring Europe down to the common denominator of their contributions, which they would like to see fall, and of its financial returns, which they would like to see increase, this report argues for strong, integrated community policies, both in terms of long-standing policies and in terms of the new competences entrusted under the Treaty of Lisbon.

 Mr President, Commissioner, we can see that the application of the European Arrest Warrant raises the issue of detention which is very unevenly applied from one Member State to another. Some States show demonstrable laxity when it comes to respecting fundamental rights in a prison environment. Furthermore, amongst the 600 000 prisoners in the European Union, increasing numbers are detained in a Member State other than their own, due, precisely, to the European Arrest Warrant. Consequently, they do not enjoy the fundamental rights guaranteed by their state of origin. In circumstances such as these, there is no point in hurling abuse at each other; action must be taken. That is why, last January, my colleague, Mr Lambrinidis and I submitted a written statement calling for the harmonisation of detention standards throughout the European Union, and the introduction of independent national inspection mechanisms. I hope, Commissioner, that in the Green Papers that you will propose, you will bear this issue in mind, and that there will soon be a common platform of minimum rights which applies to all Member States.

I voted in favour of this report, not with the aim of putting up protectionist barriers, but because we can no longer have a situation in which the European Union is the only one respecting the rules of the game. We can no longer ignore social and economic dumping in emerging countries, China in particular, which are winning contracts with rock-bottom prices in the countries of the Union, without regard for social rights and legislation on State aid, whereas the markets of these countries remain inaccessible to European companies. We can no longer be naïve: the survival of our businesses and our jobs depends on this. Finally, I am pleased that the amendments submitted by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament concerning respect, in the context of public contracts, for the labour, social and environmental standards in force in the Member States, have largely been adopted. That demonstrates real awareness and represents a positive and necessary change. It is now for the Commission to assess this call fully. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

I voted in favour of this report to enable the transformation of a report which is all too often about exploitation and the law, in an area which represents between 5 and 9% of all jobs within the European Union. All those who work with our elderly people must be able to enjoy freedom of association and rest time, and must not be subject to harassment and arbitrary practices. That is why we wanted to send a strong message of support to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the trades unions prior to the negotiations on the adoption of these new instruments, which will commence in June at the 100th International Labour conference. We regret, however, that the right is happy to express concerns about illegal domestic workers while refusing to recognise that all too often, such situations involve workers with no papers, who are the main victims of precarity and abusive practices.

 I voted in favour of this report, which will enable the exponential demand for access to high frequency-consuming mobile Internet to be met in the short term, in particular, through the allocation of the entire 800 MHz band, freed up by the changeover to digital television in our various countries, to electronic communications services. In the medium to long term, our aim must be to improve the use of spectrum across the board, by recognising its social, cultural and economic value. At the same time, we are promoting innovative technologies (femtocells, cognitive technologies) in order to respond qualitatively to the demand for use of frequencies. This will contribute to the objectives that the Union has set itself, including that of bridging the digital divide, so as to ensure that all Europeans have broadband access by 2015.

 I voted in favour of this report as it is important to clarify matters at a time when the role of lobbies is still giving rise to much debate and, at times, conjecture among European citizens. We regret, however, that the registration of organisations has not been made compulsory, especially as it is a de facto
 obligation to register in order to receive a card to enter our premises. On the other hand, we have fought to ensure that the offices representing local, regional and municipal authorities in the European institutions are not affected by this measure, contrary to what was planned in the initial text. We consider these structures to be the direct product of democratically elected bodies. They represent the general interest, and should therefore be distinguished from lobbyists, who defend individual interests. Nevertheless, this register is an important step forward because, in many areas, the lack of transparency surrounding the role of lobbies can present a real democratic problem.

 I voted against this report. We want a free trade agreement between the EU and India that helps to promote sustainable development, and that is accompanied by clear clauses concerning respect for ILO standards, environmental rules and corporate social responsibility obligations. The right’s rejection of these requests is particularly regrettable. We also deplore the fact that the right-wing in Parliament rejected the amendment designed to ensure equal treatment of European and Indian workers. This is not only harmful to Indian workers; it is also very dangerous for European workers. We must not accept the liberalisation of services and social dumping aimed at bringing down European wages. Moreover, the European Union must not forget its founding principles. The Treaty of Lisbon stipulates that trade policy must contribute to sustainable development, eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 I voted against this joint motion for a resolution. The compromise resolution was a good starting point, and I supported the amendments in favour of a carefully planned and prepared phase-out of nuclear power, reflecting the fight against global warming. I also voted in favour of the amendments calling for investment in research and innovation, in order to promote energy saving and greatly increase the number of renewable forms of energy. However, the outcome of the vote – the incoherent vote – forced me to vote against the amended resolution. It is now vital to hold an in-depth debate on all these issues and to carry out an energy transition in a spirit of solidarity, taking into account the situation in all the Member States.

 The European Union’s trade policy should be consistent with the general objectives set out in the Treaty on European Union and contribute to sustainable development, employment and social progress in Europe and in its partner countries, as well as to a form of globalisation in which human and social rights are respected. Ms Jaakonsaari’s report on a new enhanced partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and Kazakhstan points to the latter’s serious shortcomings with regard to democracy and human rights, in particular workers’ rights. It states that, in order to tackle these practices, which are incompatible with the objectives of the European Union, the trade component of the agreement must include a binding chapter on compliance with social, democratic and environmental standards. I call on the Commission to apply the recommendations set out in this report in the ongoing negotiations. In the event of serious breaches of human rights, the European Union should not be afraid to invoke all conditionality clauses included in the agreement and, if need be, to suspend it temporarily. This conditionality is a prerequisite for maintaining a fair external policy and even-handed trade policy. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 In the resolution on public procurement, the European Parliament has strengthened the Commission’s proposal towards a social Europe: the most significant step forward is that authorities should no longer opt for the lowest bid, but for the most economically advantageous tender – one which includes, for example, environmental aspects. Likewise, the issue of subcontractors is taken into account in order to prevent abuse in relation to working conditions and workers’ safety. Nevertheless, there is still progress to be made where European public procurement policy is concerned. In particular, the Commission must impose the principle of reciprocity on its trading partners: if the Union agrees to open up its public procurement markets to third-country operators, then European companies should also have access to markets and public works in these countries outside the EU. European companies and employment in Europe must be a priority when business opportunities are looked at. The Commission must ensure that its forthcoming Public Procurement Directive serves the dual purpose of providing more quality jobs and offering quality services to users. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Since its inception in 2001, the World Trade Organisation’s Doha trade negotiation round has had the task of redressing the balance of world trade rules in favour of developing countries. These negotiations have now stalled. Various factors have contributed to the stand-off, for which all parties bear some responsibility, but it is developing countries that will be hit hardest by the failure of the negotiations. Every effort must be made to conclude the negotiations, but also to take into account the concerns raised, not least by developing countries, and particularly the situation in sensitive industries and in agriculture, where food security for citizens must be the priority. Public services should still be governed by each country to reflect the public interest, rather than being liberalised as part of enforced horse-trading with no reference to social needs. Subject to these conditions, the conclusion of the Doha Round is both desirable and necessary. The proliferation of bilateral agreements – like those currently under negotiation – will prevent us from establishing clear and fair rules. Multilateralism is still the best framework for ensuring fair trade that will encourage sustainable development across all continents. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the comprehensive economic and trade agreement negotiated with Canada will strengthen our links with a large and long-standing EU partner country. We welcome this, but we must keep track of all its consequences, not just the benefits it will bring for certain economic sectors or certain major international investors. In particular, the agreement must respect the social and environmental models of both parties – of the EU Member States and of Canada – and their capacity to continue to legislate in what are sensitive areas for our societies. These are not mere details or points to be left for another day. As regards public services, the Commission’s chosen ‘negative list’ approach is dangerous. It is far too broad and ill-defined, and we would not like to see it set a precedent. Also, from a general point of view, the chapter on investment must respect both parties’ right to legislate in areas such as the environment, public health, employee and consumer rights, industrial policy and cultural diversity, among others. We call on the Commission to exclude sectors such as culture, education and public health from the scope of the agreements. In this respect, and as other Members have said, the intellectual property part should not call into question issues relating to generic medicine production. As for the environment, we are concerned and call for investment. As regards the impact of the agreement on oil sands drilling, the agreement must not have the effect of weakening European legislation on the application of the Fuel Quality Directive, nor must it limit the possibility for Canada to regulate drilling of its oil sands in the future under its environmental remit. We also call on the Commission – we are asking the question, anyway – to monitor the impact on the fisheries sector in areas such as St Pierre and Miquelon. These are areas of Europe that could be severely affected by the complete liberalisation of that sector. Lastly, I echo Mr Kazak in saying that the sustainable development chapter must include social and environmental commitments and, in particular, social and environmental responsibility on the part of large multinationals. Harlem Désir,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-India free trade agreement negotiations are ambitious, they concern many economic sectors, but they are also a cause for concern in Europe and in India, as I was able to see during last month’s meeting between the trade committee of the two chambers of the Indian Parliament and the European Parliament’s delegation for relations with India. India is booming; it is a strategic partner, as you have reminded us. Everyone understands the importance of developing trade between us. Yet we are not starting from scratch, since the Union is already India’s main trading partner, the main investor in India and the main destination for Indian investors, and India is also the main beneficiary of the system of generalised preferences. We will therefore have to be alert to any new impact that a new and more far-reaching trade agreement may have on fragile sectors of the Indian economy. I am thinking, for example, of agriculture – our Indian colleagues spoke to us about this – and of the consequences for sectors that are particularly exposed to competition from emerging countries in Europe, and I am thinking of the car industry. Such an agreement should serve the development of our societies and of employment and not give rise to uncontrolled liberalisation that would have disastrous effects. That is why my group wishes to emphasise a number of points in these negotiations, which should culminate in an agreement that helps achieve the objectives of sustainable development and poverty eradication, and which should also be accompanied by clear and verifiable commitments, on the basis of cooperation, of course, but then coupled with serious social and environmental commitments. I should like to emphasise a few points in particular. Firstly, regarding agriculture – which I mentioned earlier – we call on the Commission to ensure that none of the agreement’s provisions, either on the liberalisation of agricultural trade or on intellectual property rights, threaten small-scale farming in India. I am thinking of the provisions on seeds, for example. Secondly, regarding generic medicines, India is the biggest producer of generic medicines in the developing world. We call on the Commission to stop demanding data exclusivity, since all the NGOs say it is liable to harm the distribution of those medicines. Thirdly, in the area of services, we call, firstly, for public services to be left out of the sectors to be liberalised and, secondly, concerning mode IV, for the principle of equal treatment to be guaranteed – in other words, for all forms of social dumping to be rejected. Lastly – thank you, Mr President – we believe that the sustainable development chapter must include binding commitments in relation to respect for social and environmental standards, in particular, ILO social standards.

 The report by Mrs Guillaume is an important step towards the revision of EU rules on asylum and protection for applicants for 2012. In view of the terrible tragedies that have taken place, such as the recent sinking of a Libyan boat off Lampedusa, this revision is vital, particularly considering that an applicant’s chances of obtaining asylum may differ greatly according to the Member State. With this text, we are calling on the European Commission to include in the proposed revision the right to free legal advice from the start of the procedure; better consideration of vulnerable applicants, such as unaccompanied minors; and a framework for the time limit for appeals. My one regret, however, is that the European right adopted a tightening of accelerated procedures based on the notion that asylum seekers are primarily potential fraudsters, limiting their rights. However, the adoption of Mrs Guillaume’s report sends a clear signal to the Council and Commission that they need to work to guarantee all asylum seekers in Europe decent, fair conditions and procedures.

Too often, the European Union is distant from its citizens, its policies seem far removed, and the European project lacks meaning in the eyes of Europeans. If the Single Market is only to be a conduit for rampant liberalisation, deregulating public services, social systems and workers’ rights by submitting them to fierce competition, this is a cause for concern, even though it has and may have several positive specific consequences for consumers and in the everyday lives of our fellow citizens. With Mr Correia de Campos’s report, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have fought for better regulation when it comes to strengthening the Single Market, and for this strengthening to serve the general interest of Europeans and not just that of businesses. Such interests include consumers’ rights, the protection of workers’ rights against the tendency towards social dumping, with an explicit recognition of collective labour agreements in all the Member States of the Union, the call for a recognised framework for public services, and universal access to these services. The integration of the Single Market must now go hand in hand with the advances of a social Europe, which is needed more than ever at a time when the recession continues to affect Europeans.

 For over 10 years, the European socialists have been fighting in the European Parliament for a tax on financial transactions. This tax would have many benefits: not only would it discourage financial speculation; it would also fund aid to developing countries and their adaptation to climate change, while contributing to the European Union’s budget. The world is now in a different situation: the recession has made the need to stabilise the financial markets yet more acute, and the European Union needs new resources to overcome this recession – it must overcome it by means of a recovery, not by means of austerity. At the same time, the groundswell in favour of the tax is getting bigger: more and more governments are supporting the idea, and the European Parliament has already voted repeatedly in favour of introducing a tax on financial transactions. This new vote in favour of the tax is an important step: Parliament is saying that we must act immediately at European level, even if there is no global agreement. Parliament’s request is clear, and the vote was an overwhelming one: we must now turn our words into deeds and implement the tax on financial transactions. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Over the last few months, the Lithuanian Parliament has passed a series of laws forbidding or punishing any reference to homosexuality or bisexuality in public. A bill currently being debated in the Parliament aims to amend the Code of Administrative Offences to punish ‘the public promotion of homosexual relations’ with fines of up to EUR 2 900. This legislation is in complete breach of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and of the European Union Treaties which commit the EU and its Member States to upholding freedom of expression and fundamental freedoms and to providing European instruments to fight discrimination and human rights violations. In adopting this resolution, we are calling for this bill to be withdrawn, for respect for sexual orientation to be included in the list of principles protected under the country’s Law on Education, for minors to have the right to freely access information about sexual orientation and for clarification of the prohibition stipulated in the country’s Law on Advertising. This is not the first time that a Member State has impeded European citizens’ rights and freedoms regarding sexual orientation under the pretext of non-interference, thus, in effect, encouraging discrimination. This homophobic hysteria must stop. Harlem Désir,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to begin by thanking my colleagues in the Committee on International Trade and, in particular, the shadow rapporteurs from the various groups for their cooperation in the drafting of this third report on a related topic. Today, we are able, thanks to this cooperation, to present a set of innovative, concrete proposals to move corporate social responsibility forward within the framework of EU trade policy. After the international crisis and the economic and social damage it caused, and after the debates it prompted, the expectations voiced by the public and the political expectations for lessons to be learnt, our common conviction is that Europe’s trade policy must contribute more than ever to the objectives of regulating globalisation and, in particular, to its social and environmental objectives. This regulation concerns the States and their economies, but it is clear that the main economic players are undertakings and, in particular, multinational corporations: they are the main players in world trade. They are the ones that have benefited most from market liberalisation, not only in terms of gaining access to customers, but also in order to externalise part of their production and to diversify their supply arrangements, often by drawing on countries where production costs are low and, above all, where social and environmental rules are applied less rigorously. The liberalisation of trade has been accompanied by fierce competition among countries seeking to attract foreign investors and by stiffer competition between undertakings. All too often this has led to unacceptable abuses in relation to working conditions, and to human rights violations and environmental damage. From the Bhopal disaster at the subsidiary of a chemical multinational in India, which claimed thousands of victims and for which the parent company has still not been punished to this day, to the behaviour of oil and mining companies in Africa, in Burma, and in many other countries, which is destroying their environment and reducing their workers to the rank of slaves; and from child labour in Asian textile factories to the murder of trade unionists on agricultural holdings in Central America, the examples are legion. And they are all the more unacceptable given that they often concern undertakings from industrialised countries, their subsidiaries and their supply chain, including European undertakings. This gave rise, many years ago, to a debate and a campaign which, I might add, was supported on several occasions within this Parliament through the adoption of resolutions on corporate social and environmental responsibility. The progress made in corporate social responsibility (CSR) is not yet on a par with the debate on social standards in trade agreements, the subject of the report by Mrs Saïfi. This is understandable, because trade agreements concern legal rules that are binding among the States, whereas corporate social responsibility concerns voluntary commitments by undertakings. At the same time, however, it is paradoxical, because CSR and the social and environmental clauses pull in the same direction, namely, towards globalisation which is more respectful of human rights and the environment and which is conducive to sustainable development. We therefore propose to incorporate CSR into trade agreements and, specifically, to incorporate a corporate social responsibility clause into the chapters on sustainable development, especially of free trade agreements (FTA), with a number of clear and verifiable commitments by undertakings. First, there must be a reciprocal commitment between the European Union and its partners to encourage undertakings to enter into CSR commitments and to verify them: the establishment of contact points not only to foster the provision of information but also to receive complaints from trade unionists and civil society; a requirement for corporations to publish their balance sheets regularly, which will reinforce transparency; a reporting requirement; and a requirement for undertakings to show due diligence and to take preventive measures. Finally, we propose that, in the event of serious breaches of the principles underpinning CSR and also of the violation of social rights and social and environmental laws, there should be mechanisms ...

 Mr President, as you can see, I had two minutes left. You knew this, so, if you had a time issue earlier, you could have deducted the time from this part of my speech, which could have been shorter. I should especially like to thank my colleagues and the Commissioner for his reply. What has been striking in this debate is the very broad consensus extending beyond the differences between groups. This is, however, qualified by the need to genuinely take greater account of the social and environmental dimensions in trade policy, in the agreements we negotiate. When you cut me off for your very interesting speech, which I am sure our fellow citizens throughout the Union will have found fascinating, I simply wanted to raise a point that the Commissioner himself raised, which is that corporate social responsibility cannot – he is absolutely right – replace compliance with the law and the responsibilities of the Member States. Furthermore, Mr De Gucht is also right when he says that, at this very moment, within the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and also within the World Trade Organisation (WTO), as a result of Professor Ruggie’s report, which Mr Howitt mentioned, new steps have been proposed with regard to the responsibility of multinational companies, not only in relation to mining but also in many other areas of responsibility – especially as regards their foreign subsidiaries – within their spheres of influence or throughout their supply chains. Judicial cooperation will also ensure that a parent company cannot evade its responsibilities in relation to the action of one of its subsidiaries or of a subcontractor, when it has infringed environmental or social rules. All of this is absolutely critical. I simply believe, though I admit it will be difficult, that we must establish a link with trade agreements. There are already a small number of references to corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the agreement with Korea and in the agreements with Latin American countries. I believe that, through the dialogue we have begun today with the Commission, we must continue to ensure that our CSR objectives and our sustainable development objectives are consistent with each other in international trade agreements.

Following Parliament’s vote, the Union is, at long last, going to regulate the activities of the most speculative investment funds. A long time has passed since Poul Rasmussen’s own-initiative report which, back in 2008, proposed that strict limits should be imposed on these ‘financial black holes’. It has taken the financial crisis to make the Member States and the majority of Parliament agree to adopt binding legislation on alternative funds. For the first time, these funds, whether or not they are based in Europe, will be subject to controls, restrictions on their activities and greater transparency; carving up businesses will no longer be possible, and the European Securities and Markets Authority’s supervisory powers will be extended. Much remains to be done to supervise finance effectively in Europe; ESMA, not the national authorities, should be the only authority with responsibility for this matter, and businesses should be protected even more from speculation. Had it not been for the reservations of the conservatives, the Union could have adopted more rigorous and more effective legislation. This is merely a first step. The text we have adopted will be revised in four years’ time. This will be an opportunity to go further, on the basis of an assessment, in order to protect the economy and jobs from the damage caused by speculation. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

In order to ensure the continued security of international transport, especially in the face of the risk posed by terrorism, it is vital for countries to be able to exchange information on passengers – PNR data, collected by airlines. However, it is just as vital to ensure that these provisions do not jeopardise citizens’ fundamental freedoms or result in some people being discriminated against because of their origin or religion. That is why the protection of personal data must be guaranteed better. The European Parliament has one clear demand to make before the Commission starts negotiating the methods of exchanging PNR data with the United States, Canada and Australia: the protection of personal data is too sensitive a subject for these negotiations to be conducted exclusively among Member States, behind closed doors. They must be conducted transparently, at EU level. The data transferred must be used only within a strictly defined context and must not be transferred to a third country. Many types of information will have to be excluded from the data that can be collected, in particular, that information in connection with ethnic origin and religious beliefs. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Parliament has just voted at first reading for extending maternity leave to a minimum of 20 weeks all over Europe, paid at full salary, except for high earners, and the possibility for fathers to take at least two weeks’ leave following the birth of a child. This is a victory for the proponents of a social Europe and a step towards more equality between men and women in Europe. A section of the right used the future cost of these measures as an excuse to reject this progress. Yet helping parents to reconcile family and work life will make it easier for parents to go back to work, will boost European birth rates and will safeguard the health of mothers and babies. The left of Parliament, with Portuguese Socialist rapporteur Mrs Estrela, held strong, the European right was divided and the move towards progress won the day. The battle must now be won at the Council, where several governments are threatening to block this directive. Members of national parliaments should take this up and intervene with their government so that governments do not undo what the European Parliament is proposing for a Europe that protects its citizens’ rights.

 The crisis has revealed the shortcomings of Economic and Monetary Union: it nearly brought down the euro and has resulted in the loss of millions of jobs throughout the continent. With Pervenche Berès’s report, the European Parliament has just adopted a coherent strategy proposal to lift Europe out of the recession and to address the latter’s financial, economic and social repercussions. This proposal includes the introduction of real financial supervision, which we have started to implement, but which will have to be considerably strengthened; the taxing of financial transactions in order to regulate the markets and finance public assets, and to reduce public deficits; the coordination of Member States’ economic policies and budgets for the benefit of sustainable growth; the appointment of a Mr or Mrs Euro to be in charge of the euro area and to unify its representation at the G20 and IMF; and the creation of the European Energy Community. It is now time for Europe to get going again. This is what the public expects. In a constantly changing world, inertia is tantamount to decline.

 The reinforcement of health care systems in sub-Saharan Africa is a crucial aspect of development policies. Compensating for the shortcomings in care systems will also have an impact on public health worldwide, through improved training for medical professionals, appropriate prevention campaigns and reduced treatment costs. This will contribute to a fall in serious epidemics, such as HIV, tuberculosis and dysentery. It is not acceptable for private companies to hinder access to health care for the sake of profits, and it is even less acceptable for conservative religious movements to reject sexual and reproductive health policies and question the right to abortion, thereby putting the health of millions of women at risk. In order to improve the health care systems in sub-Saharan Africa and throughout the world, it is essential for the European Union to be more in step with the rest of the international community. In particular, it has a role to play in encouraging the emergence of non-profit-making, solidarity-based mutual health structures, enabling the promotion of access to quality health care. This is why I support the adoption of Mrs De Keyser’s report. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Yesterday saw the opening of the United Nations summit on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. Even if progress has been achieved, we are far from the objectives set for poverty reduction between now and 2015. In order to achieve them, the first imperative is job creation in the developing countries, as, according to a recent joint report by the IMF and the ILO, there are more than 210 million unemployed in the world in 2010, as the crisis has caused the loss of 30 million jobs since 2008. The ILO is calling for employment to no longer be considered as an outcome of other policies but as a primary objective and pillar of growth strategies. Sustainable development, support for jobs and support for decent work demand support for the diversification of the economy, compliance with ILO standards, a set of social protection rights for all, investment in public services and addressing basic needs such as access to water, to health and to food security. More employment will also be a prerequisite for the stability and strengthening of democracy. That is the thrust of the Theocharous report. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, for the first time, Parliament will be called on to give its assent to a readmission agreement. This is a very important responsibility which I believe Parliament must exercise seriously, since it involves the safety of the people concerned. Pakistan is a state which has neither signed nor ratified the Geneva Refugee Convention or the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons. This agreement could affect not only Pakistani nationals but also citizens of other countries fleeing war and disturbances, and here, I am thinking, in particular, of Afghans who could well find themselves, as a result of this agreement, being sent to a state that offers no guarantees whatsoever. Therefore, Parliament’s first – and, I think, most legitimate – request is that we be given an assessment of the previous readmission agreements, since this was, after all, what the Commission promised. Secondly, we call for Pakistan to sign these Geneva Conventions before any agreement is envisaged. Thirdly – and this is the very least we expect – we ask that Parliament be able to take part in the Joint Readmission Committee; in other words, that it also is able to monitor the terms on which any future agreement is implemented. As the situation stands at the moment, I do not think we should give our assent tomorrow. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 The motion for a resolution on the situation of the Roma people is a major snub for Mr Sarkozy and a scathing call to order from the European Parliament. The stigmatisation of the Roma by the President during a speech on insecurity, the statements by his Minister for Home Affairs against the Romanians and the blatant expulsion of several hundred of them in breach of the law are an insult not only to the values of the French Republic but also to the fundamental values of the Union. Throughout history the Roma have been systematically marginalised, discriminated against and used as scapegoats. Regardless of whether they are French, Romanian or Bulgarian, today they are European citizens. The indignity of the treatment they have received should not be tolerated in a community founded on the principles of law, freedom, equality and non-discrimination, which lie at the heart of the EU Treaty and its Charter of Fundamental Rights. The resolution is therefore a firm and unambiguous condemnation of the French Government’s actions and of the discriminatory rhetoric that accompanied them. It condemns expulsions in breach of the law. It demands that the governments of Europe and the Commission coordinate their actions to integrate the Roma, using the funds allocated by Parliament.

Today, more than 20% of young people in Europe are unemployed, and many others are in casual jobs without social protection. The increase in the number of training courses casualises active young people and is a vector for social dumping affecting other employees, in that it puts pressure on companies to lower salaries and replaces normal jobs. The Turunen report asks the Commission and the Member States to organise their activities so that young people’s access to high quality training courses and jobs becomes a priority, and in order to guarantee them a decent income. It is unacceptable that some Member States are planning a lower minimum wage for young people. In this report, Parliament also calls for the introduction of a ‘European guarantee for youth’, which would give each young person in the EU the right to be offered a job, an apprenticeship, a supplementary training course or a job combined with a training course if that young person has been unemployed for four months. It also calls for the development of a ‘European Quality Charter on Traineeships’, which would include norms on time limits, minimum allowances and course-related social security benefits.

Achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 is a fundamental commitment by the international community. However, it has not provided itself with the resources to fulfil that commitment. Two-thirds of the way through, it is clear that many least developed countries (LDCs) will be unable to achieve any of the goals of eradicating poverty, of providing access to education and health care, and that most developing countries will be far from achieving them too. Europe is the world’s leading donor but, with 0.4% of GNI, it cannot be content with falling so far short of the target of devoting 0.56% to official development assistance (ODA) in 2010, a target that it set itself. The fact is, the aid requirements are greater than ever, especially in the areas of food security, the fight against climate change, education, health – in particular for HIV sufferers – and maternal and reproductive health. With the Cashman report, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is calling for the European Council of 17 June to endorse the proposal for a 0.05% tax on international financial transactions, which would yield EUR 10 billion, and to set itself the target of achieving 0.63% of European GNI in 2012, with a view to increasing it to 0.7%.

Developing countries, in particular, the poorest ones already hard hit by the 2007 food crisis, are today suffering the full force of the economic and social consequences of the international financial crisis that began in the developed countries. The latter are now inclined to reduce their development aid to face up to their own difficulties. Developing countries are thus paying twice for the mess caused by unregulated global capitalism. I voted for the Guerrero Salom report, which reminds Europe of its responsibilities and demands respect for the commitments made in relation to official development assistance, in particular, the goal of contributing 0.7% of GDP to this by 2015. By adopting it, Parliament is also calling for the implementation of an international levy on financial transactions to fund development, access to Global Public Goods and the adaptation of poor countries to the challenges of climate change. It supports cancelling the debt of the least developed countries. All of these recommendations are essential as we approach the review of the Millennium Development Goals at the United Nations in September. The European Union has a moral duty to implement these new tools of international solidarity without delay. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

The 2020 strategy is supposed to replace the Lisbon Strategy. It is, above all, in danger of prolonging the shortcomings, of ending in the same lack of results and of causing the same disappointment. It is neither a true recovery strategy nor a new perspective for the economic, social, budgetary and fiscal policies of the Union. The myriad good intentions are matched only by the absence of new instruments with which to implement them. Europe needs a different ambition; the citizens expect more convincing responses. Since the start of the crisis, the unemployment rate has increased by seven million. The banks are speculating again, hedge funds have not been regulated, the citizens are being asked to tighten their belts, drastic cuts are being made in public services and social protection is being cut back. The Greek crisis serves to reveal our lack of solidarity. That is why Europe must debate a different view of its future, one that is based on true economic coordination, a recovery characterised by solidarity, a green growth strategy, an energy community, a cohesion budget, own resources, investment in education, research, fiscal and social harmonisation, the fight against tax havens and the taxation of international financial transactions.

In 2000, I tabled with the Globalisation Intergroup the first resolution calling for the Commission to examine the feasibility of a tax on speculative capital flows. The resolution was not adopted, since it was just short of the number of votes required. Ten years have passed, the G20, like several Member States, is no longer ruling out the idea of such a tax, and above all, the financial crisis has served to remind us of the damage that volatile financial markets can cause. That is why I welcome the adoption by a wide margin of the resolution on taxes on financial transactions. This is only a small step, but the message is clear. Parliament is calling on the Commission to finally take up the issue and to work on an implementation project. A tax such as this would have the twin advantage of helping to stabilise the markets and of generating huge revenues to help developing countries finance their adaptation to climate change and the fight against poverty. Objectors tell us that it will only be effective if it is global, but make a start we must, as some countries have done with the tax on flight tickets. A wait­and­see policy will get us nowhere. We must show the way. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

The current generalised system of preferences (GSP) will soon be coming to an end. I voted in favour of the resolution, a specific aim of which is to involve Parliament fully in its revision by 2012. This trade regime enables 176 developing countries and regions to benefit from preferential access to the European market in exchange for their ratification of ILO conventions on social rights and of UN conventions on human rights. Its implementation is unsatisfactory, however. That is why we demand, before the revision, a report on the current state of ratification, implementation of the conventions, an impact assessment of the effects of the GSP during the period 2006­2009, the inclusion of a condition stipulating that 27 fundamental UN conventions must be implemented, and more transparent investigation processes – involving, in particular, regular consultation of Parliament. It is regrettable that, during this vote, an amendment calling for an investigation procedure to be carried out in Colombia concerning the numerous killings of trade unionists and the mass graves containing the bodies of hundreds of people killed in the region of La Macarena was not passed because of opposition from the right.

 Mr President, Commissioner, this agreement with Korea will be the first to truly implement the Global Europe strategy as an important agreement, and it ought therefore to be particularly exemplary because it will set a precedent. However, we note that, firstly, there is a problem concerning the information given to Parliament, particularly with regard to the safeguard clauses, then a problem concerning the method used, since we have already been told that it might be possible to implement temporary provisions or temporarily to implement the agreement without even waiting for Parliament’s assent, and finally, a problem concerning the clarity and transparency of the trade framework – this was raised by Mr Rinaldi – since, through the duty drawback, we could in fact have an agreement indirectly concluded with China. I believe we must be particularly clear about these free trade agreements. In addition, there is a consistency problem with regard to the aim of developing social and environmental standards. When it comes to compliance with social standards, we are, for example, a very long way from what the United States has negotiated in its agreement with Korea.

Mr President, Commissioner, you have stated your hope that Tunisia will make progress in the areas of democratic reform and freedom of expression. You are right to do so, since this is quite simply in line with the association agreement and with the commitments that Tunisia has made to the European Union. That is why I am very surprised by the comments made by both Mr Baudis and Mr Michel, which seem to be encouraging you to ignore this aspect of our relationship and our cooperation with Tunisia, and to ultimately abandon Article 2 of the association agreement. Moreover, there is a long way to go before these commitments are honoured, judging from the fate – as already mentioned by my colleague, Mrs Guillaume – of the independent journalist Taoufik Ben Brik, who has been in prison since last October, following a trial in which his lawyers and the procedure were in complete violation of the law. In addition to the unacceptable denial of his freedom, his health is deteriorating and his visiting rights have been restricted. I therefore ask you, Commissioner: does the Commission intend to intervene within the framework of the Association Council to demand Mr Ben Brik’s immediate release and to ensure that his situation and his state of health may be taken into account, at the very least on humanitarian grounds?

 Thank you, Minister, for your reply. I congratulate you on your initiative to hold this conference in Palma de Mallorca in March, as it will follow on from the conference held in Stockholm. The problem is that we have to contend with multinational companies; as you said, Europe has to take the lead in corporate social responsibility, but it also has to take the lead as regards the conduct of European companies located outside Europe. The problem is that these subsidiaries are separate legal entities. Are you prepared to envisage a legal instrument by which parent companies would be obliged to assume responsibility for the conduct of their subsidiaries located in other parts of the world when they fail to meet their obligations in relation to the environment or to respect for human or workers’ rights? Because, if this obligation is not imposed, European companies will slip through the net of this corporate social responsibility that Europe wishes to promote due to the conduct of their subsidiaries located elsewhere in the world.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate Mrs Joly on her work, on the report and also on taking into account the contributions of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, and, although we have again tabled some amendments, we see our contribution in the resolution that she has presented. For our group, the partnership between the European Union and the ACP countries is part of an historic commitment, which must retain all its specific characteristics, which must not be watered down, even by the need to comply with certain rules, such as those of the WTO. We are most concerned that this partnership should preserve, in particular, the consistency of all European Union policies – trade policy, budgetary policy – with objectives in the area of development, but also in relation to the promotion of peace, security and democracy and human rights in ACP countries. It is not a question of imposing a model, but of working with these countries to ensure their development, which must be sustainable development. From this point of view, it is very important for this revision to enable us to take into account new elements of the last five years: the fight against climate change, technology transfers, renewable energy development aid, the fight against food crises, and therefore greater emphasis in our cooperation on agriculture, on food sovereignty, the fight against financial deregulation, good fiscal governance and the fight against tax havens. We see our contribution in all of that. I would like to stress two points. Trade: with the implementation of the Economic Partnership Agreements, certain provisions of the Cotonou Agreement will become obsolete, but we are concerned that this agreement should still mention that the trade clauses and the trade regimes from which the ACP countries benefit must not be less favourable than those from which they benefited previously. It seems to us that we should integrate the GSP, the interim EPAs and all these provisions in the revision of the Cotonou Agreement. Finally, on emigration – our colleagues in the group will emphasise this – we are concerned that it should actually be said that the migration agreements preserve the rights of migrants and that we cannot accept transit regimes to countries that do not guarantee respect for human rights.

Mr President, I just wanted to say that, if I understand our fellow Member Mr Papastamkos’s amendment correctly, it is about recalling the commitment made in Hong Kong by all the WTO members to abolish export subsidies.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Doha talks were opened in 2001 to correct the imbalances, in fact the injustices, of the international trade system that was introduced following the Uruguay Round, when the WTO was created. It was thus acknowledged that the Uruguay Round had not kept all the promises it had made concerning developing countries, and that the countries of the South were at an unfair disadvantage where trade rules were concerned, particularly in the field of agriculture, because these trade rules allow the richest countries both to protect their market and to continue to fund their production, including that intended for export, bankrupting many farmers of the South in the process. Cotton has come to symbolise this situation. In opening the ‘development round’, the WTO members have therefore committed themselves to amending multilateral trade rules in order to ensure that trade really does benefit economic and social development in every country, on every continent. Thus we should always remember that this round of negotiations is not a round like any other, and that, even if, as in all negotiations, everyone is waiting for progress to be made on the issues that concern them – for industrialised countries, that means industrial products and services – it was agreed, from the outset, that this round was, first and foremost, about restoring the balance in favour of developing countries. Today, in the wake of the Seventh Ministerial Conference, as before it, negotiations have essentially stalled on the slopes of Capitol Hill in Washington, just as they sank, in the past, in the sands of Cancún, and, back then, this was largely due to the demands made by the European Union. Having demanded too much during the negotiations, industrialised countries have thus jeopardised the final outcome of the round of negotiations and the credibility even of the WTO. Everyone is focusing solely on personal goals instead of on the overall goal, which is to create a multilateral trade framework that is based on fairer rules to encourage fairer trade, and which promotes sustainable development and the eradication of poverty. The first outcome of this stalemate is the increase in bilateral trade agreements, which are often even more unfavourable to the countries of the South. This is a step backwards. The European Union must therefore adopt a clear position. The priority is to conclude this round as a development round and not to try to outdo one another where industrial products and services are concerned. These negotiations must not be approached in a conventional and narrow-minded manner, where everyone is simply out for themselves. This leads to a deadlock and makes one lose sight of the main issue: the need to create a new way of regulating the international trade system that will form part of the new global governance that everyone has called for, particularly since the G20, in order to address the real challenges of today, which are fair development on all continents, the eradication of poverty, food security, respect for social rights and decent work, and the fight against climate change. During these negotiations, the European Union must show what it is doing to ensure that trade rules will help improve this situation in the future. It is on this basis that each of the following points of discussion must be considered: – on agriculture: honouring the July 2008 commitments; concluding the negotiations on procedures; guaranteeing, in particular, special and differential treatment, respect for special products, and safeguard mechanisms; developing agricultural support in accordance with sustainable agriculture and food security; – on NAMA products: asking developing countries for tariff reductions – I am finishing here – that are in line with their level of development; and – on services: protecting the right of every country to continue to regulate its public services.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 28 September, the people of Guinea took to the streets to appeal for the commitments that had been made to be honoured, and for free and democratic elections to be held, as promised. They have suffered the worst possible repression by a regime that was already devoid of all legitimacy and which, that day, lost all dignity. Men were repressed, women were disembowelled with bayonets, and raped, and the political opponents and trade unionists were tortured and maimed. The European Union must today support the African Union, ECOWAS and the United Nations in refusing to allow this crime to go unpunished and, above all, in showing solidarity towards the Guinean population. This country, which has an abundance of assets, will never be able to use them for its development as long as corrupt dictatorships can seize them for the benefit of a clan. That is why I welcome the firm approach announced by the European Commission, one which our Parliament is able to demonstrate today. We cannot weigh strict economic interests against the commitments that were made by the European Union’s partners, particularly those who signed the Cotonou Agreement, concerning respect for human rights and respect for democratic principles. Today we have a commitment to the people of Guinea: to support them in their fight for freedom and democracy. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation between Europe and the United States is crucial in resolving most of the major crises in the world, and the new US administration certainly provides an opportunity. It has already taken some initiatives that have marked a break with the past: in Iraq, on Guantánamo, on the anti-missile shield. It would be naïve, however, to think that that will be enough to make US and European points of view identical in all situations, and that transatlantic relations will now be very simple. Whether on preparations for Copenhagen or aid to developing countries, on Doha and protectionism, on financial regulation and combating tax havens, on the relaunch of the peace process in the Middle East or a firm policy on the nuclear issue in Iran, the US is extremely unwilling to take action. This goes beyond the issue of whether or not the administration has good intentions, and often relates to the influence of lobby groups on Congress, or simply the defence of its interests by a great power which is being shaken by the new world order. All these spheres will only make progress if Europe plays its proper political role as a separate global player, in a partnership of equals – to use the Commissioner's expression – and fully assumes its responsibilities. From this viewpoint, I must say that there is a certain confusion in the European attitude and sometimes even a certain naivety, and that this also extends to Parliament. The approach being taken to the idea of a large transatlantic market, which was Sir Leon Brittan’s hare-brained scheme back when he was Commissioner, poses certain risks. This affair of barriers to trade is being tackled as if the problems were only of a technical nature. Naturally, economic and commercial trade between the United States and Europe is important for jobs and for businesses. It ought to be developed. First of all, however, trade is not really in danger. Secondly, when there is a conflict, either it relates to defending our economic interests – for example, as in Airbus – or it poses a risk to our health or environmental rules – in the case of beef containing hormones, for instance, or chlorinated chicken – and we should therefore not prioritise the improvement of economic relations over our own internal model, our social model, our environmental model, or development model, as if economic relations were an end in themselves. We must be able to combine the two, and we should not surrender our political autonomy in search of a partnership that is, in itself, a commendable objective. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two Member States – France and the United Kingdom – have announced their intention to send to Afghanistan refugees who came to Europe in an attempt to save their own lives. I do not believe that we can continue to stand back in the face of this very serious threat to their lives. The British newspaper, The Guardian
, reported in October that some Afghan refugees expelled from Australia had been killed upon their arrival in their country. I believe that all of this goes completely against all of our international commitments. The European Commission itself said in an action plan dated June 2008 that legitimate measures to reduce illegal immigration should not result in refugees being denied access to protection within the European Union, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has warned the European Union against making any attempt to undermine the Geneva Convention and the other additional forms of protection that are designed to ensure that Afghan refugees are not deported to Afghanistan. A large number of MEPs, from four different groups, have signed an appeal along these lines. I call on you, Mr President, to talk to the European Commission, the United Kingdom and France, and our House, our Chamber, must take up this issue in order to prevent this crime against the right of asylum from being committed.

 Madam President, the excellent report by Mr Lange has three positive features. Firstly, it proposes an integrated industrial strategy for the European Union; that is to say, a strategy at once continental and cooperative, which differs in all respects from the narrowly national and non-cooperative policies in operation in Europe for the last 15 years. Secondly, this industrial strategy is financed, which is in marked contrast to the 2000 Lisbon strategy. If it were not financed, it would remain empty words. The main source of this funding is EU project bonds, Eurobonds and euro projects. In voting this morning, we faced up to that. Thirdly, this strategy protects our industries. This report is for opening up Europe; it is against giving it away. It is for exchanges founded on reciprocity and balance. Several articles focus on these issues. This is absolutely crucial because, in this area, we appear naive and weak. Henri Weber  (S&amp;D

Madam President, for such an important debate, I would have liked Baroness Ashton to have been present or at least one Member of the Council. Good for China! It has decided to lead the way in green technology; 38% of its massive recovery plan has been invested into these new industries. It is already the number one producer and biggest exporter of solar panels and wind turbines in the world. We would be only too delighted with this new direction, which can help reduce pollution levels in China and world-wide, were production to be carried out in accordance with WTO rules. However, that is not the case. Chinese exporting companies receive massive aid from state banks and local authorities. Although some green technology markets are open to foreign companies and foreign investment, many remain restricted in terms of quotas and some are even closed. Our European industries are under threat in the light of such unfair competition. Commissioner, China has signed WTO agreements. The European Union must ensure that it adheres strictly to the rules.

Mr President, the European Union has many tools to make it a global leader in the manufacture of clean cars and, in particular, of electric cars. The Commission must ensure that this project is a major European objective by encouraging the large car companies on our continent to cooperate with one another, with such cooperation extending from research and development to marketing. It must encourage the widespread installation of accessible and interoperable charging points in Europe, starting with urban areas. It must draft and enforce common rules and standards – if possible, at international level, but certainly at European level – and it must do so without delay. Lastly, it must encourage the Member States to gradually replace their fleet of combustion vehicles with electric cars. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the ban on removing the fins of sharks on board vessels. This practice has been prohibited in the EU since 2003, but some shipowners benefiting from exemptions in Spain and Portugal are suspected of ‘finning’, which involves cutting off a shark’s fin and throwing its flesh back into the water. The report therefore plans to force all fishermen to wait until their vessels have landed before cutting off sharks’ fins. This debate is a perfect illustration of the need to establish a real European fisheries control policy. The practice of ‘finning’ is unacceptable, but there is no proof that it takes place in Europe. However, in view of the doubt, it was necessary to remove any possibility of the continuation of such practices. Since controls have failed, the European Parliament has been forced to eliminate all exemptions, which will not be without consequences for professionals. The challenge now is to ensure that the issue of European fisheries control is dealt with more effectively. In particular, uniformity of controls must be promoted and the resources allocated to this vital tool for our fisheries policy must be increased. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 As shadow rapporteur for this report, I was involved in defining artisanal fishing. This term features repeatedly in texts on the common fisheries policy reform, without appearing to fit the definition established by the Commission. Indeed, the latter admits to having opted for a simplistic definition – currently, all vessels measuring 12 metres or less. However, this fails completely to take account of the diverse nature of European fishing. Given that small operators have more difficulty in gaining access to European funding, a new definition may be required to ensure fairer distribution of this funding. To that end, classification as a micro-, small or medium-sized enterprise and the skipper-on-board requirement appear to be more appropriate criteria. Even if Parliament has not come up with a final definition of artisanal fishing, this report should be welcomed for anticipating the discussions on the financing of fisheries and for wisely acknowledging that there is not one single criterion but a whole range of criteria for defining artisanal fishing.

 I voted in favour of the Lövin report, an own-initiative response to the Commission communication on the external dimension of the common fisheries policy. In the context of a CFP reform in which European fishing rules are becoming ever stricter, this report seeks to promote a sustainable fisheries policy beyond the EU’s borders, so as to protect European fisheries from unfair competition, by proposing that fishery products imported into the European Union should be subject to standards aligned with our own as regards environmental and social sustainability. Fish have no concept of borders. The European Union’s efforts to exploit fish stocks sustainably will be in vain, therefore, if we do not make sure to apply these requirements worldwide. By tackling the issue of the common fisheries policy reform in a global context, this report serves, in its own way, to foreshadow part of the substance of the future CFP. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, the debates on fisheries at this part-session each herald, in their own way, part of the structure of the future common fisheries policy. As architects of this policy, we must always bear in mind that each pillar of sustainable development affects the balance and solidity of that structure. In other words, the fisheries policy must at the same time be economically viable, safeguard jobs and preserve resources. These five reports put the main objectives of the future CAP to the test: maximum sustainable yield, reducing rejects and allocating fishing rights. These objectives cannot be mere slogans, however. Consequently, the technical measures in the Gallagher report, despite being only transitional, highlight the difficulties involved in moving to practical cases, fishery by fishery, stock by stock. The Ferreira report on artisanal fishing rightly recognises that there is not one criterion, but a range of criteria, for defining artisanal fishing. The Gróbarczyk report highlights the lack of data. The Lövin report on the external dimension points out that we are evolving in a global context and looks at the conditions for the exploitation of resources outside European waters as well as the import conditions to ensure fair trade. We cannot allow the restrictions imposed on our fishermen to continue without balancing them with import restrictions to prevent unfair competition. Finally, the Patrão Neves report on sharks emphasises, in particular, the urgent need for stronger EU controls. The success of an ambition cannot just be declared: it requires patient, meticulous work between goals and resources. That is what we are trying to do. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report on protecting children in the digital world. The digital world is a great tool for communication, information and education. However, children today are accessing this world at an increasingly young age. Parents are not always able to protect them in this enlightening but complex universe, where there are dangers such as commercial targeting, sexual abuse, bullying on social networks, etc. I supported this report because it will allow greater coordination of actions at European level. Education about digital media, tackling illegal content and content harmful to minors, protection of privacy and the right of reply will help to protect children. This report has successfully brought together two important principles: protecting children and defending freedoms. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 The Erasmus programme has proved its worth by enabling millions of young people to go and study in another country, improve their qualifications, learn a foreign language and discover another culture. The scheme contributes to European integration but also to the personal integration of young Europeans. Anything that came in its way would be a step backwards at a time when citizens are having their doubts about the EU and our young people are having doubts about the future. The programme is now a victim of the short-term vision of some Member States that, in the name of defending liberal dogma, are endangering one of the EU’s tools for investing in the future, that of training and that of youth. Discussions on the 2012 and 2013 budgets are well on the way to overcoming this deadlock, but this should not be disconnected from the negotiations under way on the financial framework for 2014-2020. The proposal of a freeze on the EU’s budget is unacceptable when we are promoting education and qualifications as the main assets in the fight against unemployment, particularly of young people. On the contrary, a substantial increase in the EU budget is necessary to get through the crisis and prepare for the future. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

I voted for the report on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources, a report voted on unanimously in plenary, which was a historic moment! The report itself presented no problems. The access regime to the current zone of 12 nautical miles, which is managed and controlled by the Member States, is one of the CFP measures introduced in 2002 that has been the most widely supported by stakeholders, and the effectiveness of which is undisputed. The report voted on in plenary only had the effect of extending the time limit of the regime until 31 December 2014, after which it was expected to be brought into line with the CFP reform currently under way by means of a new regulation. The vote was unanimous because certain questions raised by the committee were not addressed, such as the proposal to extend the derogation in coastal zones beyond the current limit. In order to avoid any further extension, the rapporteur also proposed that the regime should be extended indefinitely. These questions will of course be discussed in more detail when the future regulation is adopted, which is expected to cover a period of 10 years. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to support Peugeot employees. Almost EUR 12 million will be released for the 2 089 workers who were made redundant by Peugeot. These funds will be used to finance active reintegration measures additional to those required by virtue of French law and to help the workers to find new jobs. However, I regret that this support for Peugeot employees is one of the EGF’s last on the basis of the ‘crisis’ criterion and that access to the Fund will be restricted in the future. At a time when the recession and unemployment explosion are hitting European countries, the Council has unfortunately decided that this ‘crisis’ criterion may no longer be invoked to mobilise the EGF.

 I voted for the report on the minimum level of training for seafarers. The European Parliament had limited room for manoeuvre, since the Member States had already accepted the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW). These changes constitute progress on training and the harmonisation of the issue of certificates of competency. They also improve the prevention of fraudulent practices and the standards applied in respect of fitness to work, medical requirements and requirements concerning alcohol abuse. In a sector which operates without borders, it is in the interests of seafarers, as well as in the general interest, for the certificates issued by Member States and third countries to be recognised everywhere in Europe. However, to avoid a ‘race to the bottom’, it is necessary to ensure that a certain number of strict common criteria remain in place. We can be satisfied that this is the case. I also welcome the Commission’s initiative of obliging Member States to communicate the available information on certificates, an appropriate provision which will help establish an overall picture of the current state of affairs and a strategy for employment in the sector.

 I voted in favour of the report on measures taken for the purpose of the conservation of fish stocks in relation to countries allowing non-sustainable fishing. The content of this report is crucial, as it seeks to ensure fair competition between European fishermen and third countries. Faced with an ambitious European legislation to protect fish stocks, we must be given a guarantee that our fishing activity is not relocatable at lower environmental costs. This report mentions the option to restrict imports of fishery products originating from countries allowing non-sustainable fishing, to restrict the provision of port services to vessels flying the flag of those countries or to prevent Union fishing vessels from fishing the stock of common interest under the responsibility of the country allowing non-sustainable fishing. However, I note with regret that the report is entirely conditional, so I hope the European Commission will be quick to make a legally binding proposal on this matter. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted for the report on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products, although it would have been a better idea to put it to the vote after the adoption of the basic Regulation on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The progress achieved by the vote is patchy. On the negative side: this report provides for a market of landed by-catch, and yet this landing has not yet been agreed in the basic regulation. It is, however, necessary to have at our disposal a legal framework, without pre-empting any means which will be implemented to limit, or even eliminate, by-catches. I was, on the other hand, very much in favour of Parliament recognising the need to put European funding for the storage mechanism on a sustainable basis and agreeing to create an eco-label. Producer organisations have also been given greater power and recognition, and can, in particular, become transnational. Finally, the report supports the development of aquaculture, a development that I support providing that we bear in mind that this activity is complementary to fishing and must be set within a framework of strict environmental standards, without promoting the creation of a fish meal market.

 I voted in favour of the report on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources. This own-initiative report is satisfactory because it has allowed us to move the debate on the common fisheries policy (CFP) forward, particularly by highlighting the consensus in Parliament on the need to improve data collection, an essential prerequisite if we are to arrive at a sound definition of the CFP’s objectives at a time when the status of some fish stocks is still unknown. However, it is only one vote in the process. This report also points out the need to go in the direction of greater decentralisation, at a time, in particular, when the Commission has stated that there are too many ships in the European fleet compared with available fish stocks. Yet it does not study the realities of each coastline and the different fish stocks found there. The report also notes that one of the prime priorities of the CFP should be jobs, because without fish, there is no fishing, and without fishermen, neither is there any fishing. Finally, Parliament has noted that transferable fishing concessions should be an optional management measure, and recognised that the obligation to land by-catch should be adjusted to the realities of each fishery.

 I voted in favour of the overarching communication on the common fisheries policy (CFP). This non-binding report is acceptable insofar as its content anticipates and influences forthcoming debates on the basic CFP Regulation. It has enabled us to make some progress on the Commission’s proposals, which is important for future negotiations, and which, I hope, will allow for further improvements. In the face of the EU’s very controversial proposal to introduce transferable fishing concessions, a tool for liberalising the fishing industry, Parliament spoke in particular in favour of a voluntary system, allowing Member States to decide whether to implement it or not, which is an encouraging start. Parliament also noted that we should reach the maximum sustainable yield by 2020, and not exceed it, a notion thought to be too vague. The proposal to land all by-catches, which the industry has great difficulty in implementing because of technical constraints, has also been watered down, in favour of a gradual implementation on a case-by-case basis, depending on the characteristics and realities of the different fisheries. There should be further discussion about the technical feasibility of implementing such a measure. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report on the sulphur content of marine fuels. With this directive, the EU is making provision for a reduction in the sulphur content of ship emissions to 0.1% by 2015 in the Baltic Sea, the English Channel and the North Sea. It therefore transposes into EU law an obligation required by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), which was difficult to ignore. The 2015 deadline, however, seems very premature given the economic and technical constraints that it will impose, especially on passenger shipping. The fear is that some ships will have to be withdrawn from the fleets, as there will be no way of adapting them to the new requirements, leading to the loss of hundreds of jobs in an economic context where passenger transport companies are facing difficulties. Negotiations in Parliament have, however, allowed us to confirm that State aid would be authorised to support the operators in this transition. There is also a reminder that Member States can still approach the IMO for an extension to deadlines to allow their fleets to be fitted out within the deadlines. These different safeguard measures have led me to approve the transposition of the European Union’s international obligations in this directive. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report on Education, Training and Europe 2020. Education and training are crucial elements in achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and ensuring the future growth of Europe. The current economic difficulties must not be used as an excuse to reduce the resources set aside for education and training. In order to guarantee the investments for the future, the Socialists proposed excluding investments in education and training from the national deficit calculation of the fiscal compact. As the report points out, dropping out of school early has a higher cost than the crisis. There is thus no point in making short-term savings that would compromise future growth. For the same reasons, we encourage the Member States to devote at least 2% of their GDP to higher education in order to ensure a knowledge-based economy. However, additional efforts are required in the area of early childhood education and schooling, which is a crucial stage in the development of our future workers and citizens.

 We are preparing to vote on a number of texts that will define the future of European fishing. These texts affect hundreds of thousands of jobs, our food autonomy, the preservation of fish resources and the durability of an economic sector. Despite the fact that these major issues are evidently of general interest, the Commission has given its draft reform a very liberal slant. Parliament’s work has, of course, toned down these proposals. It is just a first step, however. Future work must go beyond declarations of intent. From now on, we have to build real tools to achieve an economic, social and environmental balance for this activity, in accordance with the EU’s 2020 strategy. It is just as essential to preserve jobs as it is to preserve resources. We urgently need to establish homogeneous controls throughout the Union. Similarly, we can no longer use different methods to collect scientific data. The renewal of the fleet is essential for the emergence of a future fishing sector that is more selective, safer, cleaner, and more efficient and thus more profitable. Otherwise, we will be left with one question: is the fisheries policy an exception to the 2020 strategy? Kader Arif,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we have just heard, the question of public procurement reform is a fundamental one for Europe, particularly at this time of crisis. European rules are generally focused on the criterion of price, which means that our businesses are helpless in the face of foreign operators that do not hesitate to practise social and economic dumping in order to win public procurement contracts in Europe. That is why it is essential to recognise additional criteria, including in the WTO agreement on government procurement. In the debate that I led in the Committee on International Trade, I stressed the need to reform that agreement and to extend it to new countries, particularly emerging ones. However, the creation of new instruments is also urgently required. In particular, we need an effective and binding tool for establishing a greater degree of reciprocity with countries that do not offer equivalent access to European operators. Since the Commissioner has brought it up, I should also like to receive more details about the legislative proposal that is being drafted. Lastly, we need to create an instrument for supervising buyouts of European businesses by foreign capital, in particular, by sovereign funds. This is a solution that has already been applied by the United States through an ad hoc
 committee and which ensures the protection of this strategic sector. Europe, which can be naive or weak when faced with its foreign competitors, would be well advised to take inspiration from it. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, aside from the work which Mr Caspary has done, I find that the new trade strategy proposed by the Commission does not address the challenges which Europe has to face in light of the financial, economic, social, environmental and food crises we are experiencing, nor does it address the expectations of our fellow citizens who are calling for stronger regulation and for a new sustainable growth and development model for the planet. Unfortunately, however, this does not or no longer comes as a surprise. Faced with these calls for new regulation and new solidarity, the Union must establish a new doctrine for an alternative trade policy. If Europe does not advocate a fairer form of trade that is founded on the values of justice and that generates quality employment in both Europe and the rest of the world, who will? Solely promoting services is not a policy. We need to preserve strong industrial and agricultural sectors through an employment-generating industrial policy and an updated CAP. The inclusion in all of our free trade agreements of social and environmental standards, and stringent human rights rules which guarantee decent working conditions, is fundamental. Europe must lead the way in balancing trade openness with room for public intervention and the legitimate protection of various economic sectors both in Europe and in its partner countries – a fair trade policy for fair trade should be the aim.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ever since the United Nations General Assembly agreed to create two states on the territory that formerly constituted the Palestine Mandate in 1947, we have never stopped waiting for that commitment to be realised. So how can we now accept the caution expressed in the speeches? In the light of this historic opportunity, how can we justify refusing to back President Abbas’s request fully? Let me remind you, Baroness Ashton, that sometimes caution can result in cowardice. I would therefore like to pay tribute to the courage and perseverance of one man, Mahmoud Abbas. He is the bearer of a legitimate hope, that of a people who have a right to a land. For those who object to the fact that this initiative could provoke an outbreak of violence, let me remind you that a few years ago, the suppression of a similar initiative fostered the Second Intifada. My message is simple, Baroness Ashton: at the time of the Arab Spring, it is your duty and ours to support the Palestinian request to the hilt. The European Union boasts of having brought down a wall and of recognising states. It will be able to stand even prouder if it recognises that the Palestinians are also entitled to statehood.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am even wearing a flower-patterned shirt to symbolise the Arab Spring. Who could have expected, a few months ago, this wind of change energised by the universal values of democracy and which is now blowing on the southern shores of the Mediterranean and more widely on the Arab world? No one. Certainly not most European leaders who have been urging us for years to enter into agreements of all kinds with dictatorial regimes for the sake of Europe’s interests. Today, I say to myself that it is never too late to show courage and dignity – the courage to say to our people that there is no Muslim horde about to sweep across Europe, but that there is a young population who, paying with their blood, want to see democracy irreversibly established, and want Europe to be a partner who helps them, so that the rule of law is no longer an illusion but becomes a reality. Tunisia and Egypt are currently in a situation of emergency. There is not enough time here for me to give an overview of the countries where there are uprisings. However, I do want to vigorously condemn with all my heart, here before you, the atrocities committed by the Gaddafi regime in Libya and the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. Naturally, this condemnation is directed at all countries where the word ‘repression’ is opposed to the word ‘freedom’. In moments like these, even if history is sometimes cruel, the international community – of which you are one of the dignitaries, Madam – should react so as to show support to and solidarity with the peoples who have taken up the struggle, but also to condemn in the strongest possible way, and in all instances, all these contemptible regimes and all the countries that do not comply with international law or with United Nations resolutions. In your communication of 25 May, you mentioned this support. I know that this is one of your priorities. However, I urge you, Baroness Ashton, even if this means devoting all your energy, to move from appeasing words to constructive solutions. I would not wish to see, as the only response to this Arab Spring which is changing the face of the world, a European winter where narrow-mindedness sets in, borders close and walls come up.

 I voted against the resolution tabled by the European right, as it promotes an ultraliberal vision of the EU’s trade relations with India. The right systematically opposed the amendments that I tabled on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament in order to rule out any liberalisation of public services, strongly condemn child labour, request legally binding clauses on corporate social responsibility and demand respect for the principle of equal pay for equal work with regard to Indians who will come and work in Europe in the future. The compromise was impossible, the differences of opinion obvious and irreconcilable. Only the resolution tabled by my group, together with those by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, offered a progressive vision of EU-India trade relations. Unsurprisingly, it could not hold out against the right-wing majority in Parliament, which is a shame. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 In anticipation of the EU-Japan Summit at the end of the month, Parliament has adopted this resolution stating its views on trade relations between the two partners. Unlike the European right, which spoke out very strongly in favour of opening negotiations on the conclusion of a free trade agreement, I defended a more cautious approach. Japan is a trade power that needs to be approached with caution when it comes to trade liberalisation. That is why my group opposed the present text presented by the European right and stressed the need to launch specific impact studies assessing the consequences of stronger trade relations for all the sectors concerned (in particular, the automotive sector) and for employment in Europe, before we open any negotiations. At the same time, we emphasised the problem of non-tariff barriers, which prevent European businesses from accessing Japanese public contracts. Indeed, it is wrong that the European Union, the region in the world that is most open to foreign investment, cannot operate on the markets of its industrialised partners under fair conditions.

 In the wake of the floods that devastated Pakistan in 2010, the Council called for emergency measures to support the country. I tabled an amendment rejecting the regulation proposed by the Commission, as trade preferences of this nature are a good idea in theory but not in practice. Our response to a humanitarian crisis cannot be based on trade, especially considering that it is now one year on from the disaster and the urgency is not as strong. This type of support is illogical and prejudicial, as some people in Europe, in particular those working in the textiles industry in several of the southern countries, will end up paying for support for Pakistan that we should all be paying for collectively. Furthermore, by only targeting certain industries, we are not helping all Pakistanis. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Since the Treaty of Lisbon, investment has been an area of exclusive EU competence. Parliament therefore initially gave its verdict on the shape of the future European investment policy. This is the report I myself drafted, which was voted on during the last part-session in April 2011. In Mr Schlyter’s report, Parliament has now examined transitional arrangements for managing investment agreements that Member States have already concluded with third countries. As in the vote in committee, I advocated a Community vision and stated that agreements that were already standing should be closely examined by the Commission in order to check their compatibility with the Treaties and with Union law and Union policy, in particular the objectives of the Union’s external action on sustainable development. However, the vision that has prevailed in the end is a right-wing vision in which protection of private investors is given priority over these objectives based on the general interest. Unfortunately the negotiations that will now be entered into with the Council are not likely to correct our aim, in an EU in which the good of the Union as a whole is rarely able to withstand national egotism. Kader Arif,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by sincerely thanking all those with whom I have had the opportunity to work on this issue. All the contributions have helped in the drafting of this report and, thanks to the cooperation of all the political groups, and I am especially grateful to the shadow rapporteurs, we have on the table today a consistent text that sends out a powerful message. Indeed, we are at a turning point in European investment policy and at a time when we have to seize the new power conferred on us by the Treaty of Lisbon in order to meet a dual challenge. Firstly, that of providing European businesses with the tools they need for high quality foreign investment that is protected by a legal framework providing long-term support. Secondly, Europe must strengthen its position as the world’s leading beneficiary of foreign direct investment and give itself the means to control that investment so as to encourage sustainable development that creates high quality employment. By voting on this report, the first official expression of our institution since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, Parliament is fully assuming its role as a new colegislator in trade regulatory matters and is voicing its priorities at a time when the first investment protection negotiations are about to begin. This expression is essential, because it is intended to relay the concerns of the citizens, who are showing a growing interest in trade matters and whom we must support. In a world, today, where conflicts also take place in a trade context, protecting those businesses of ours that invest abroad must become a priority. International agreements have been created to protect investors from harsh, unjustified expropriations and hidden laws aimed simply at eliminating them from this or that market. This primary objective must be maintained. Although Europe is one of the most open markets in the world, a balance must be restored with our main partners so that European businesses can benefit from a level playing field. This is the proposal made in this report, which stresses the need for future agreements to include standards relating to non-discrimination, fair and equitable treatment, and protection against direct and indirect expropriation. However, those standards must be defined in such a way as to prevent any misinterpretation. Some businesses have, in fact, used the vague wording in first-generation investment agreements to protect their interests beyond what is legitimate, for example, by attacking new social and environmental laws that harm their interests. Appearing before international arbitrators and with no transparency or possibility of appeal, they have demanded considerable compensation by claiming that those laws are on a par with indirect expropriation. Europe, which, in the future, will receive ever more investment, particularly from emerging countries, must guard against such abuses. That is the idea behind the reforms undertaken by the United States and Canada, two countries whose governments and authorities have suffered several setbacks in international arbitration cases and which have radically overhauled their investment agreement model. By proposing new definitions of protection standards, the report strikes a fair balance between the protection of investors’ rights and the right of public authorities to regulate. This also means including in all future agreements specific clauses laying down the possibility for public authorities to legislate and regulate in the areas of national security, the environment, public health, workers’ and consumers’ rights, industrial policy and cultural diversity. Lastly, increased protection for investors must be accompanied by more responsible behaviour, particularly in developing countries, where the social and environmental laws are less binding. That is why the report mentions that social and environmental clauses should be included in all free trade agreements signed by the Union. Furthermore, we must go beyond naming and shaming and include in all future agreements a set of clear corporate social responsibility rules with which businesses must comply and which are based on guidelines set by the OECD. If our aim here really is to shape the contours of a new European investment policy, then I call in this report for it to be exemplary and to promote investment which is sustainable, respects the environment and encourages good quality working conditions in Europe and in third countries alike. That is why this report, by the power vested in it by Wednesday’s vote, must serve as a reference for all future negotiations conducted by the Commission. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first allow to me to express the regret that it took a crisis in Europe to trigger the debate we are having today and the motion for a resolution we will vote on tomorrow. Just last year, when the developing countries rose up in what was called the ‘food riots’, Europe simply proposed emergency response measures, that is, to send seedlings and fertilisers, as though the problem were cyclical, when we have long been warning of structural problems. We have a common agricultural policy (CAP) that lacks effective regulatory mechanisms because the liberal majority still believes that nothing must restrict the market. There is widespread, economically destabilising and morally unacceptable speculation on agricultural products of developing countries that are prisoners of single-crop farming for export, with a Europe that does not support them and allocates only 4% of its development aid to the agricultural sector. With this resolution, Parliament as a whole finally acknowledges that the right to food is a basic human right, that it is unacceptable that the hunger of some is exploited for the benefit of others, that regulation is indispensable in ensuring price stability, and that trade agreements must preserve small family farms and the right to food. Today, Parliament is delivering a clear message. It is up to the Commission and the Council to translate it. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, it can never be said often enough that what is happening in the southern Mediterranean and, more generally, in the Arab world, is historic, especially for those peoples who, half a century after their countries gained independence through decolonisation, are today gaining their individual and collective freedoms. It is historic, but also unexpected, as are all popular revolutions, I hear you say. However, this new situation requires us to totally rethink our vision, our policies and our relationships with these countries. Proposals have been made. Indeed, the caution with which we have reacted to date is easily and worryingly explained by our obsession with stability, by which I mean that safety-first approach fuelled by our fears, an approach of which the sole priorities were the fight against immigration, terrorism and radical Islam, along with some economic interests, not least access to energy. We accepted authoritarian regimes, when their sole aim was to confirm our fears. The people’s revolt has made the failure of our policies plain to see; we no longer have the right to go on basing our analyses on the same fears, or, worse still, the same xenophobia-tinged beliefs. That is why we must stand side by side with those who aspire to greater freedom and democracy, in places where it is possible to be Muslim, democratic and secular. That is the message that we are being sent. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, until now I had suspected that peoples were always ahead of their political elites. Today I am quite sure of this. May I first of all pay tribute to the courage and determination of the Tunisian and Egyptian peoples. They have reminded us that the values that we stand for in the world – human rights and democracy – are not values exclusive to the West, as some proclaim, but rather are universal values shared by all. Europe, in my view, can no longer continue to make mistakes in this part of the world, shilly-shallying as it does from wrong analyses to misguided projects. These peoples are expecting a response from us that is equal to their courage and aspirations. They are not asking for charity but they are certainly asking for solidarity, and even more so for responsibility. In these uncertain times, nobody wants chaos, but nobody should have to accept the status quo any longer, either. We must support the hope created by the events in Tunisia and Egypt in order to help affirm and establish democracies that will benefit these countries and their populations, but which will also benefit us, and I believe that you have expressed this forcefully, Baroness Ashton. I shall conclude by quoting what a poet once said: ‘The world sleeps from a lack of imprudence.’ These peoples, quite rightly, have been imprudent in calling for their freedom, but I hope above all that they will have awakened our consciences.

 Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the elections in Côte d'Ivoire have just taken place. The international community tolerated their being postponed year after year by the regime of Laurent Gbagbo. These successive reports alerted a number of us to the difficulties in which we find ourselves at the moment but, deep within ourselves, we hoped that the democratic spirit would prevail in a country that has suffered a great deal from sterile and unacceptable confrontations focused, in particular, around the concept of Ivorian nationality. The international community and, in particular, the European Union around Baroness Ashton and through my fellow Member, Mr Preda, mobilized to ensure that these elections took place under the best possible conditions, transparently and without violence. This should be commended. In view of the calm that prevailed and the atmosphere of mutual respect among candidates, the electoral campaign gave us cause to hope that the result would be accepted by all the parties. Today, unfortunately, the democratic result that emerged through the ballot box has been rejected by the outgoing President. Tomorrow, like my fellow Members, I will therefore vote in favour of appealing to Mr Gbagbo to accept that what appears to him to be a reversal of fortune or a conspiracy is, in fact, simply the will of the majority of his citizens. He cannot hang on to power without calling into question part of his own militant history, which was to appear, when resident in Europe, as the man who had brought about the newly regained freedom and democracy established in his country. The United Nations representative in Côte d'Ivoire courageously assumed his role and announced the results of the ballot. As First Vice-President of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I would also like to point out that a declaration was adopted by our Assembly on 3 December in Kinshasa firmly condemning the decision of the Ivorian Constitutional Council for invalidating the results. This declaration comes on top of the clear and unambiguous position taken by the leaders of the Member States of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and of the African Union. Today, the regime of Mr Gbagbo is neither wanted by its citizens, nor supported by its neighbours, nor accepted by the international community. It is therefore time that he accepted the victory of Alassane Ouattara, the democratically elected President of Côte d'Ivoire, who must be in a position to take on the responsibility entrusted to him by his people as soon as possible. Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to conclude by asking the European Union to assume its role through the means at its disposal to persuade Laurent Gbagbo and his illegitimate government to accept that the game is over. We will not allow his obstinacy to lead to chaos in Côte d'Ivoire. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the title of this debate is likely to create a certain optimism because in theory, it is about defining the procedures for helping banana-producing ACP countries. The reality is entirely different, and I have to say that the way they have been treated throughout this report is quite simply unacceptable. We must first and foremost bear in mind the fact that the banana sector is vital for many African and Caribbean countries. Yet, despite this, they have made the effort to accept, at the WTO, an agreement which lowers the European customs tariff to EUR 114 per tonne, in order to put an end to a long-standing dispute with Latin American producer countries. However, the Commission seems to have forgotten to inform them of the bilateral negotiations under way with these same countries on a far lower tariff: EUR 75 per tonne. In other words, the commercial consequences of these agreements will be deeply felt in a context in which the lion’s share of the European banana market is already held by multinationals based in Latin America. Faced with this situation, during the last plenary session of the ACP-EU Assembly in Tenerife, all the members agreed to adopt as one a declaration calling for support measures tailored to producers’ needs to be implemented without delay. Back in Brussels and Strasbourg, I see that, unfortunately – and this is no surprise – the right is backtracking and even opposing any reference to this declaration. I am tired of this double-dealing, but, above all, I fear that this weariness is shared by our historical partners, who no longer believe in our will to truly support their development. Kader Arif,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am always very happy to speak after Mr Fjellner, as I am always sure that I will not be in agreement with him. First, I should like to thank our rapporteur as well as all the shadow rapporteurs and, in particular, my friend Mr Susta, for their excellent work and their good cooperation on this text, which will finally enable a system of compulsory marking of origin on certain products imported into Europe to be introduced. I should like to thank you too, Commissioner, for your commitment. Our vote tomorrow will, in fact, be the first stage in the introduction of this regulation, which dates from 2005, and which the European Parliament has always supported and called for. Origin marking is an important step towards transparency and information, which we must constantly improve in favour of European citizens. Indeed, European consumers rightly want to know what they are purchasing, where the product comes from and under what conditions it was produced. They are therefore demanding to be able to consume in a more informed and, hence, responsible way. With this new regulation, we are responding to this demand, because our citizens will be better informed, in particular, of the social and environmental conditions under which the goods they purchase are produced. Contrary to what some people want to believe, the consumer is also a citizen, who agrees to pay more for quality European production, because this legislation is also essential for European companies, whose production is associated with a reputation for quality and high production standards. For those companies that have chosen to maintain production safeguarding know-how and employment in Europe, this regulation will re-establish a level playing field with our third-country trading partners. The text resulting from the vote of the Committee on International Trade is balanced, which is why, when it is voted on in tomorrow’s plenary, I call on the Members of this House not to call this balance into question and to support this text by voting overwhelmingly in favour of it. Kader Arif,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are clearly faced with a text whose complexity troubles many of us and, even more, in my opinion, the citizens of Europe. Commissioner, I asked for transparency and you responded. Today, I am somewhat concerned. Indeed, as I see it, beyond the purely technical issues, the main risk is that of the direction we are beginning to take with regard to this increasingly complex relationship between individual freedoms and the Internet. The world is changing rapidly, and we are all aware of this. We are all aware of the revolution taking place in access not only to information but also to culture via this tool. In today’s world, where such access is immediate and free, traditional reference points are being undermined. Our most complex task is, therefore, to define new regulations, because regulation is necessary not only to protect artists and rights holders; but I do not want to see individual freedoms ignored. As regards the protection of freedoms, one of the most important of which is the protection of the right to privacy, one of my main concerns is the possibility afforded by the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) of travellers’ personal effects and baggage being checked at borders. Does this mean that our mobile telephones, our MP3 players and our computers may be searched by customs authorities looking for illegally downloaded files? According to the Commission, this is just a possibility, because the precise term used in the text is not binding. It is said that the Member States may choose whether or not to allow their personal luggage to be searched. However, let us get serious here for a minute. How can one expect such wording not to be seen as incitement to carry out such checks? Do you really think that a government, especially if it is pressurised to some extent by its music industry – and I cite this example deliberately – will not take this opportunity afforded by ACTA to move its national legislation towards increased screening of passengers entering its territory? Another problem is that, if it is proved that the files held by a private individual are for commercial use, punishment is automatic. However, who determines whether the files we hold are of a commercial nature or not? Some may say that a person with 500 songs on his or her MP3 player necessarily has commercial objectives, but why would others deny themselves the opportunity to fix this limit at 300, 100, 50 or 10? In fact, for an ill-intentioned person, all it takes is to illegally download a single film in order to make thousands of copies of it, and that then becomes commercial activity. Finally, punishment will be meted out by the courts of each country, but a European citizen arrested by the border authorities of a signatory country on the basis of particularly binding legislation will have no means of challenging it. Is it your wish that such an abuse be possible? Was it not the responsibility of the Commission precisely to do everything it could to ensure that the agreement prohibits searches of personal effects? I have deliberately raised only this issue this evening, but you have raised many more, which we will incorporate into the resolution I have requested and which will ordinarily be voted on in next month’s plenary. Commissioner, I would ask you to take account of the outcome of this vote, which will be in line with our commitment, that is, to take account of the word of the European Parliament before you sign the act. Kader Arif,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

Mr President, Commissioner, here we are, finally, after many months of work, aiming to lay the foundations for the European Union’s future External Action Service but, like some of my fellow Members before me, I should like to thank the rapporteurs for the quality of their work. Since our shared vision is to see a real European diplomatic service which is not just an extension of the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States, the Financial Regulation and Staff Regulations, which we will discuss today and vote on tomorrow, are of paramount importance. They must give us the means to face a dual challenge: speaking with one voice on the international stage, but also guaranteeing consistency in all the Union’s external policies. With this in mind, trade policy does not fall within the High Representative’s mandate, but as a former trade commissioner, I have no doubt that she can establish the dialogue which is needed to ensure that trade policy, as specified in the treaty, observes the goals of the Union’s External Action Service, in particular, sustainable development, eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights. Lastly, I should like to stress that our shared political will will be measured by the budgetary resources earmarked; our ability to have political punch on the international stage depends on it. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, and as has just been pointed out, the Treaty of Lisbon strengthens Parliament’s powers. However, few of us are aware of the radical change that it brings about, particularly in the field of trade policy, which I follow closely. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament will ratify all international trade agreements. This is already causing quite a stir, and the discussions on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and on the free trade agreement with Korea are merely a first sign of this. However, the socialists and democrats in the Committee on Trade wanted to go further than the treaty allows. I am their spokesperson, and despite the scepticism of some and the opposition shown by certain others, I conveyed a clear message: if Parliament is to ratify any trade agreement, it must be involved from the start of the process. What used to seem idealistic is now a core element of our relations with the Commission, since we will be fully consulted on the negotiating mandates. I welcome this. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to continue to respect the Community spirit and the democratic will that are at the heart of the treaty. I also call on my fellow Members – since we suffer from a kind of Stockholm syndrome where the Commission and the Council are concerned – to use all our rights, because they are the rights of our fellow citizens. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, please allow me to make a general remark about this report which, in my opinion, is a reflection of our relationship with Turkey. Although I must congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their work, what I mean to say is that it is ambiguous. It reflects our indecision with regard to that country. As, one by one, the amendments were adopted, or otherwise, within the Committee on International Trade, an underlying – almost subliminal – issue, but one which was largely outside the scope of economic and commercial relations with Turkey, kept emerging: are we for or against that country’s accession to the EU? They reflect a kind of hesitation, which has not been taken on board: should Turkey be regarded as just another third country with which commercial relations might well be developed, or as an accession candidate, which thus imposes particular obligations which must be fulfilled by both parties? It is indeed difficult to say today whether this report accurately reflects the reality of our relations with that country, and especially whether it actually defines an EU strategy in this regard. It depends on which side of the fence we stand: do we simply want a privileged partnership, or do we want Turkey to actually accede? I should simply like to warn against the contradictory signals we are sending out. We cannot maintain an ambiguous approach with regard to our common destiny while, at the same time, worrying that Turkey seems to be distancing itself from the EU. A partnership requires frankness but it also requires trust. It requires frankness, because Turkey does, in fact, still need to make a great deal of effort to ensure root and branch reform and fulfil its undertakings. However, it also requires trust, which itself requires us to provide encouragement and send out positive signals. When the Turks voted to reform their constitution a few days ago, they also did what the EU is asking of them: they are gradually bringing their legislation into conformity with our standards so that they can become a fully fledged Member State. There is still a long way to go and a great deal of effort to be made, but let us refrain from creating additional obstacles and diverting our relationship from its aim, which is membership. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I can still only see good things emerging from a reform such as this, which is always highly complex. The signal indicating that the army is less powerful and that democracy is moving forward is, for me, an important signal sent out to the EU. One can always criticise and believe that certain things have not been done, but a step forward is still a step forward. I am not a pessimist by nature, and I think that all the actions taken by Turkey are along the right lines and that it is expressing a desire to accede. Let us therefore try to support it.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you have just said some reassuring things, but I still do not think that the concerns shared by a large number of Members about the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) have been completely dispelled. Back in March, I proposed a resolution, which was passed by a large majority in this Chamber, and which made it possible to publish the negotiating text. During the debate, we called for the acquis communautaire
 – which you have referred to – the safety and supply of generic medicines to be guaranteed and the fundamental freedoms of our fellow citizens to be respected. We also referred to geographical indications, and we did so in order to tell you our priorities, which I am going to keep on repeating to you so that the position which you will defend in a few weeks’ time in Japan is based on the parliamentary debate which we have managed to initiate. Yesterday, during the debate on the State of the Union, many speakers quite rightly pointed out that we MEPs are the spokespeople for our fellow citizens and that, without this link, the Commission is in danger of engaging in a sterile confrontation with Parliament. I am therefore asking you, Commissioner, to consider, as a priority, that the MEPs before you are first and foremost your partners and are not here to simply contradict you. The partnership we want is not one in which we are bound, as your services sometimes seem to want, by a vow of secrecy. Your services have just answered our questions behind closed doors. We are given the latest version of the ACTA text but we are prohibited from sending any messages when we leave these meetings or after we have read the agreement, whereas our role is to alert, explain and ensure things are understood. This is therefore my second request for you to regard the transparency of debates as an element which enriches your deliberations rather than as a breakdown of trust. In addition to these two main issues, and because I am starting to become accustomed to this type of exercise, I am going to inform you of my concerns. First of all, there is access to medicines. This has been mentioned. You tell us that protecting access is one of your priorities, that you are doing everything possible to ensure that nothing in this agreement hinders their manufacture or free movement. At this point, however, I would ask you about patents. Why do you want to include them in this agreement? The desire to step up the legitimate fight against counterfeiting should not be a pretext for using ACTA as a means of extending the rights of patentees way beyond what is set out in the TRIPS agreement. Please do not confuse generic medicines with counterfeit medicines. Another important point is safeguards. Texts cannot be too rigorous in ensuring a true balance between the rights of users and those of rights holders. I refer you to the various formulations contained in the TRIPS agreement. I welcome your comments about the Internet and I have great confidence in the idea that ACTA will not serve to weaken the EU position clearly expressed in the E-Commerce Directive. Commissioner, there are definitely other issues I should raise this morning, but the first duty I am setting myself is to ensure that, thanks to this debate, we are able to provide as much information as possible on this agreement to all our fellow citizens, and to tell you that the key element for me is the protection of their rights and their fundamental freedoms. This is why I expect you to bear in mind the points raised by Members and to defend them during the negotiations. I also call on you to honour your commitment to publish the text as soon as the negotiations have been completed, whether this is at the end of the round in Japan or at a subsequent stage. The public debate will have to take place, for example, in this Chamber. I shall therefore ask for a resolution, and we expect you to take our point of view into account before any signing of ACTA takes place, even if this means returning to the negotiating table.

 I voted today in favour of this resolution because it strongly condemns Israel’s attack on the humanitarian flotilla bound for Gaza, and demands that an international and impartial inquiry be carried out in order to shed all possible light on this deadly assault. This is a firm stance that demonstrates our common desire to see justice served, and I welcome that. For too long, Europe has been an economic giant, the leading provider of development aid to the region, but a political dwarf, incapable of having a decisive influence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict so as to enable a peaceful solution to be found. Today, thanks to the perseverance of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, this House is expressing its clear, strong position in favour of the immediate lifting of the Gaza blockade, which has resulted in a genuine humanitarian disaster. Europe must face up to its responsibilities. It has a duty to play a decisive political role in order to finally achieve concrete results in view of the creation of a viable Palestinian state.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial, economic and social crisis that we are going through is unprecedented. It is hitting our continent and its peoples hard, it is causing huge social and human difficulties, and Greece, unfortunately, is a harsh and shameful example of this for us. Unemployment is constantly rising. Already, millions of Europeans are jobless, and the figure is rising from one day to the next. The response must be political, strong, swift and coordinated, and it must take into account the serious environmental crisis that we are going through, which requires a new development model. These many crises give rise, among our fellow citizens, to a great deal of expectation and to a hope to which the Europe 2020 strategy should have responded. However, in the face of these challenges on an exceptional scale, the response has not materialised, and I regret that. The guidelines laid down in March by the European Council are not up to the task. There is no determination, no ambition, but, unfortunately, that does not surprise me any more. Everywhere, you Members of the Council and of the Commission, you and your Commissioners boast about the consistency of your policies. However, I have the impression that this is just an umbrella concept to disguise your lack of action. You do not have a consistent strategy combining economic, social, trade, industrial, agricultural or research policies to guarantee sustainable and fair development. Moreover, the external dimension of European trade-related action is nowhere to be found or is under the auspices of the untouchable liberal ‘global Europe’ dogma. We want trade to be a proper instrument that helps to create jobs and growth, to combat poverty and to promote development. However, you are pursuing – not for technical reasons, but for political reasons – a different objective: you are racing to reduce costs and to cut wages, you are racing to conclude bilateral free trade agreements to the detriment of multilateralism, thereby causing social and fiscal dumping. That policy is responsible for too many job losses, too many relocations and too much social damage to carry on as it is. To conclude, we expect the Commission and the Council to rekindle the European spirit, and to reject national self-interest so as to make Europe a haven not just of prosperity, but of solidarity too. Ensuring that Europe projects a different image of itself not only to its own citizens, but also to the rest of the world: that is what the resolution by the Group of the Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is all about. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D
),

The resolution on ACTA, which has been adopted today and of which I am one of the initiators, is extremely symbolic because it is unanimous. It is a clear signal sent out to the Commission, which has been negotiating this agreement in the utmost secrecy for two years. Parliament demands complete transparency with regard to the negotiations under way, as well as respect for the treaties, which entitle it to receive the same information as the Council. Whether in terms of the method or in terms of what we know of the substance, I am opposed to the way in which the ACTA negotiations are being conducted. We have many fears with regard to the calling into question of the acquis communautaire
. Aside from the risk of reintroducing the ‘flexible’ response, respect for the fundamental rights of citizens, in terms of freedom of expression and of protection of privacy and of data, and the principle of non­liability of Internet access providers and hosts could be called into question. Parliament has already proved its commitment to these principles, and if the Commission does not change its strategy, I will lead the campaign against the ratification of ACTA by Parliament, as we have already been able to do for the SWIFT Agreement.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is currently experiencing an unprecedented crisis which, beyond the economic and financial crisis, represents first and foremost a crisis of the system. Even before beginning to deal with the effects of the economic crisis on world trade, which forms the topic of our debate, I wish to clarify one point: trade is not a victim of the crisis; it is also one of its contributing factors. Indeed, we are currently experiencing a period of huge global imbalances, fuelled, on the one hand, by certain countries’ excessive trade deficits at the cost of growing domestic indebtedness and, on the other, by trade surpluses stimulated by the exports of certain, especially emerging, countries with internal consumption that is not growing at the same rate. Moreover, the trade liberalisation policy conducted thus far has only exacerbated these imbalances, weakening, in particular, the poorest countries on the planet. These countries, which have been encouraged to specialise in export monocultures, have therefore found themselves destitute in the face of extreme fluctuations in the prices of raw materials, the volatility of which has increased as a result of international speculation. It is a strange world that sets as its first Millennium Development Goal the eradication of poverty and hunger but then, at the same time, speculates on the rise in wheat prices. However, the very people who defended liberalisation and deregulation at any cost in the 1990s are now finding themselves in a difficult situation as well. The continual rise in job losses, stagnant, sometimes even negative, growth, and the developing social crisis are all factors that mean we can no longer afford to let jobs disappear in the name of this cult. In a period of crisis, how do we explain to employees who are losing their jobs that the main thing is to maintain deregulated trade, even at the cost of sudden and sometimes tragic relocations? The crisis we are going through is therefore definitely a systemic crisis, to which we must respond with a new development model. In its current Global Europe strategy, the vision developed by the Commission is essentially based on access to the market and the liberalisation of all sectors. Commissioner, I believe we need to redefine this strategy, which has been on the wrong track and sometimes led to setbacks. It is not by forcing developing countries to open up even more that we will revive our industries’ exports. That would only aggravate the situation in those countries, which already accommodate 70% of the 59 million people in the world who lost their jobs in 2009. On the contrary, it is essential to consider a new strategy that strikes the right balance between openness, protection and support. I would like to return to these ideas. We cannot ignore these developments, which lead the United States to make further use of its trade defence tool or China to take issue with the WTO over European anti-dumping measures. Indeed, when we are faced with unfair practices, it is clear that protection is necessary, but the principle of it must be accepted and defended internationally and the sometimes false accusations of protectionism dismissed once and for all. Moreover, the need for support for trade policies is becoming more obvious every day, and such support depends, in particular, on the policies implemented by the Union being genuinely consistent. Consistency in policies is not an intellectual debate, but an absolute necessity if we want to redefine a new development model. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in September, we were already debating in plenary the free trade agreement between the European Union and Korea. There were already many of us who expressed our fears about the negative consequences of this agreement, especially with regard to the automobile sector. We did not think that events would prove us right so quickly. On 21 January, Opel announced the closure of its Anvers site, the production activities of which will be relocated to South Korea. Are we to believe that this decision has nothing to do with the free trade agreement that has just been negotiated? Allow me to spot a connection there. During this period of economic crisis in which the workers are the first to pay for the mistakes of the financiers, the Commission is duty-bound to consider, now more than ever, the job-related consequences of the agreements that it negotiates. It is no longer possible to give a simplistic response to these employees, for whom we know full well it will be very difficult to find another job. We cannot say to them that international trade is a game of winners and losers and that, unfortunately, they are the ones who will be sacrificed and that we can do nothing about it. We expect answers from you today, Commissioner. First of all, we want to know whether your Directorate-General has assessed the impact of this agreement on jobs in Europe, for I must tell you that the figure greedily announced, that is, the EUR 19 billion profit that European exporters are expected to make, does not convince us. Where does this figure come from? On what study is it based? Leaving aside the expected positive effects, however, have the negative effects also been taken into account? The Commission has drafted a regulation on the methods for implementing safeguard measures within the context of this agreement. These methods relate, in particular, to duty drawback, an advantage that has never before been conceded, not even to our developing trade partners. The proposals put forward provide for complicated procedures for invoking and enforcing the safeguard clauses. Nevertheless I feel reassured because, for the first time ever, Parliament will soon be able to express an opinion on this text under the ordinary legislative procedure. I would, however, like to point out that Europe’s employment problem will not be solved by palliative measures taken on a case-by-case basis. That is why I, together with my whole group, am calling for a real European industrial policy, one that represents a genuine strategy for the future of our industries, to be drawn up at last. In a context of economic crisis and of intensified global competition, this industrial policy must be coordinated effectively with the common trade policy so that our free trade agreements do not lead to job cuts in Europe. A second matter on which we expect clarification is that of the protocol on cultural cooperation included in the agreement. Several Member States have reacted very harshly to the negotiations initiated with Korea, a country that has failed to ratify the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. I condemn the very principle of initiating negotiations on this topic, and I believe that cultural issues should be handled separately from trade negotiations and placed in the hands of the Commissioner for Culture so as to prevent this matter from becoming a negotiating item under the same heading as conventional goods or services. To conclude, Commissioner, you know how essential it is for MEPs to be kept fully informed of the negotiations under way and to be involved at all stages, including from the point at which the negotiating mandate is defined. Leaving aside our differences in approach, I would like to point out that better upstream consultation of Parliament would have made it easier for us to understand the strategy being pursued. I therefore trust I can count on your support and on that of your Commission to assist us in our future work, with everyone acting within the scope of his responsibilities, but always for the benefit of a trade policy that is obviously more European in scope, but that is, above all, fairer. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, trade policy is going to be a major factor in the Union’s external policy. Unfortunately, this trade policy is today the symbol of the disappearance of Community interest, since it is nothing other than the addition of national interests. At a time when we want Europe to defend its values – solidarity, social justice – when we want Europe to be able to integrate into its trade agreements social rights, environmental rights, the protection of human rights and the protection of trade union rights, we realise that the Commission’s only proposal to us is to conclude agreements in which it is felt that there is no alternative to the market and trade and that they are an end in themselves. This, as far as my political family is concerned, is unacceptable. At a time when we want this trade policy to be able to integrate industrial policy and the effects that it may have on employment policies, we realise that the Commission has given no guarantees on these points in the comments made this morning by the President of the Commission. Unfortunately, however, this does not surprise me. Nothing has been said about the horizontal social clause, about the protection of public services, about the way to see Europe change policy again or have a totally different policy. To conclude my remarks on these issues, Mr Barroso, I believe that trust is built within a two-way relationship. With your comments this morning, you have not offered us what we need to put our trust in you. Please note that, since you have not provided these guarantees, I cannot guarantee that we will put our trust in you. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Zapatero, Mr Buzek, ladies and gentlemen, in this period of crisis, trade policy occupies an ever more important place in public debate, as Europeans are increasingly finding that the trade strategy introduced at Union level has a direct impact on growth and employment. Against a background of increased international competition, the race for reduced costs has led to too many job losses or relocations. In the face of this situation, our group considers that trade must be a tool to serve objectives such as job creation, the reduction of inequalities and sustainable development. During his hearing, the Commissioner for Trade, Mr De Gucht, appeared to agree that trade could not be an end in itself. I should therefore like to know if, in the course of your Presidency, you will support a reform of European trade policy to ensure that it creates more jobs and is linked more closely to a true industrial policy. Will you also take action to support fair trade at world level, fair trade that is capable of promoting development, decent work and respect for human rights? In other words, will you introduce binding social and environmental standards into our agreements? Kader Arif,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we have an opportunity today to talk about the anti-homosexual draft legislation submitted to the Ugandan Parliament on 25 September. At a time when we are seeing an increasing number of human rights violations, I feel it is crucial, in the light of this anti-freedom law, for the European Parliament to look beyond the divisions that separate its political families and be able to condemn this bill in the strongest possible terms and to call on the Ugandan Parliament to reject the bill and to review its national legislation in order to decriminalise homosexuality. As Mr Cashman pointed out just now, every single NGO has spoken out against this bill, regarding it, moreover, as a serious obstacle to the fight against AIDS. The Commission, through Commissioner De Gucht, and a large majority of the Member States – adding their voice to the statements made by President Obama – have already condemned this initiative. I therefore call on the Commission to rethink our involvement with Uganda if this bill is adopted. A country that, at that point, would be in violation not only of international law but also of the fundamental principles of the Cotonou agreements could not continue to benefit from the support of the European Union. To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to point out that everyone must have the right to freedom of sexual orientation, without fear of imprisonment or death. This principle is not open to debate. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Doha Round was clear. It was supposed to be a round to promote development, a round allowing developing countries to correct the imbalances created by the liberal policies implemented to date within the framework of the notorious Washington Consensus. It is not surprising – although I deplore the fact – that during this crisis period, positions favouring equitable trade are on the retreat. In the face of the United States, which will not move until the health reform has been passed, and in the context of growing opposition from trade unions and the main industrial lobby groups, Europe is not managing to shift the boundaries, and it is therefore unlikely that an agreement will be reached soon. The majority within this Parliament is therefore taking advantage of the fact to return to its ideology, that of aggressive trade, based solely on the interests of gaining greater market access. Blame the crisis. In acting in this way, in seeking, above all, the opening up of the markets and the removal of all barriers to trade, those on the right wing are, in addition, completely forgetting that it is in our interests to have strong trade partners that are fully integrated into the system of world trade. The reality is that no developing country could end up strengthened by such an agreement. Together with Mr Désir, our group’s rapporteur on this resolution, we have tabled several amendments to the joint compromise text produced by the right-wing European political parties. Of course, I would like to see my own group’s resolution adopted, but this will not happen. That is why our amendments make several points. Firstly, it is absolutely vital that public services remain outside the framework of the negotiations, because they relate to people’s fundamental needs and cannot be left to the markets. Next, special treatment should be given to products which are sensitive for developing countries, particularly in the agricultural sphere. The food crisis has been swept out of people’s minds by the arrival of the financial and economic crisis. Let us not forget that food sovereignty should be our absolute priority, the first of the Millennium Development Goals. Finally, we believe that the public intervention area in developing countries should be maintained, not only by ruling out any liberalisation of public contracts, but also by protecting new industries. These few points, which are not an exhaustive list, are the absolute minimum in order to ensure that the Doha Round will truly promote development. If they do not appear in the final text, I will call upon my group to vote against it. (Applause) Kader Arif,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Moreira for his speech. On 9 December, the Euro-Mediterranean trade ministers will meet to debate the revival of our economic and trade cooperation. Firstly, I would like us all to be clear about something: if the aim of the free trade area was indeed to benefit all of the partners, from the North and from the South, setting 2010 as the date on which it will be introduced was neither realistic nor even desirable, given that there are still huge disparities in development terms between the north and the south sides of the Mediterranean. Moreover, some people are still advocating the fact that, to make progress with the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership – which I would remind you is made up of three pillars: politics, economics, and society and culture – we simply need to brush aside the political difficulties in order to make headway with the economic and trade aspect. As you will have gathered, I do not believe in this magical and pernicious view that trade alone can help us progress towards harmonious integration, peace and stability. I believe in it even less since the facts speak for themselves. For example, the Union for the Mediterranean, in brushing aside the political conflicts, was supposed to revive stagnant Euro-Mediterranean cooperation with so-called concrete and visible projects. Today, it is the Union for the Mediterranean that is stagnating, and the political disputes that have gone unmentioned have come back to haunt it. I am among those who are fiercely attached to the spirit of the Barcelona Process, who believe that progress is not measured solely by trade statistics, which are, incidentally, still too unfavourable to our partners from the South, to their populations. Trade for trade’s sake – no, I definitely do not believe in it. On the other hand, trade that is focused on development and aimed at reducing the gap between rich and poor, at ensuring that prosperity really is shared and that regional integration exists – yes, I can conceive of that. However, the negotiations still need to be steered in this direction. That is why, at this next meeting, I ask that we all be ambitious, that we not just discuss technical matters to do with the removal of barriers to trade, as though that were the aim. It is unacceptable to go on thinking that way. Regional integration, particularly in terms of the South-South network, the solutions to be adopted for the economic crisis – which is having a severe impact with its associated job losses – human, social and environmental considerations, and the human rights issue must sustain the discussions and become our main concerns once again. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I had not anticipated having to respond to Mrs Dodds but I would just like to tell her that she should read the Treaty of Lisbon because, if there is one committee that will be strengthened by the Treaty of Lisbon, it is the Committee on International Trade. Therefore I can say that, when that time comes, the European Parliament will have slightly more influence in the months or years ahead. Mr Moreira put some very precise questions to the commissioner. I heard Mr Tajani answer: Libya and Syria. There was one issue that was, all the same, disposed of very quickly, and that was the whole human rights issue, on which there has been no precise response. I very much want there to be progress in the negotiations with Libya and Syria but, at the same time, precise answers must be given to the EU’s questions, enquiries and requests regarding human rights. My second point is that I feel it is impossible to talk about the Euro-Mediterranean area without raising the Israel-Palestine issue, when we see products being imported today from the occupied territories. I would therefore also like to know where the Commission stands on this issue. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not our first debate on origin marking but, as I am sure that repetition has its benefits, I will take the liberty of joining my fellow Members in stressing the need for European legislation on ‘made in’ origin marking. Indeed, in spite of the opinion expressed by this House in 2005, then in 2007, via the vote on the resolution by our colleague, Mr Barón Crespo, the lack of a majority within the Council has always prevented the adoption of this regulation. However, a text such as this would represent a crucial advance, not only for European consumers, but also for our industries. Indeed, by indicating the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries, consumers would be fully informed of the characteristics of the product they are buying. In such sensitive sectors as clothing, leather goods and furniture, creating the conditions for consumers to make an informed choice is a major issue for those companies that have taken the decision to maintain production in Europe, preserving European knowledge and European jobs. I therefore welcome the proposal that you have just made, Commissioner, but I am anxious to stress that this proposal must remain ambitious. Seeking the support of a majority of Member States must not be done at the expense of our ultimate goal. For example, it would be unacceptable for origin marking to concern only finished products, thus making it possible to import all the components separately, to assemble them in Europe and to describe them as being ‘made in Europe’. Moreover, I would like to support the Commission’s efforts to derive maximum benefit from such an agreement. Therefore, without coming back to a repeated request to improve and to simply the rules of origin, the possibility of creating a pan-Euro-Mediterranean mark would be a significant advance in terms of strengthening sectors built around the Mediterranean and South-South trade. Lastly, I should like to stress that, as part of the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Committee on International Trade will see its powers substantially increased. The Commission will therefore be able to count – I assure you, Commissioner – on the full commitment of MEPs to monitor closely the discussions on this crucial regulation for European consumers and workers. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis that we are going through is profound and long lasting. It is therefore urgent and absolutely essential to put in place the necessary regulations and supervision of the financial sector and the banks, to prevent an even more drastic repeat of today’s crisis. The financial system must once again serve the real economy and not continue to destroy it. From this point of view, the last G20 Summit in London, which has been mentioned, ended in what were, to say the least, partial proposals, but, above all, the words have not been turned into deeds, and the financial drift is there once again. In view of this situation, and so that the Pittsburgh G20 Summit really is useful, the European Union must defend strong regulatory measures that have real consequences. Beyond the essential measures to supervise finance listed by a number of my fellow Members, I personally would like to raise the issues of trade and development, because in Pittsburgh there will also be talk of relaunching the Doha Round. Relaunch it, yes, but with the condition that the initial and central objective of this Round, that is to say development, is not sidelined again. Our southern partners, quite rightly, will not accept that their concerns continue to remain unanswered. The issue at stake in this G20 goes beyond that of the financial crisis: it is about laying the foundations of new global governance. Kader Arif,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to hear a conservative and a liberal fellow Member agree with the Commission; it makes my job as a socialist easier. I hope, in any case, that this evening’s debate will make it possible at last to address the many concerns regarding the impact of this free trade agreement between the European Union and Korea and, in particular, on European industry. You spoke of a consensus but, Commissioner, I would remind you that, for some months now, certain industrial sectors – including car manufacturers and workers’ unions, which support them – have been warning you of the possible tragic consequences of this agreement. Today, the bulk of these issues have still not been addressed. It may be the case, however, that you have chosen to sacrifice the European car industry for the benefit of services. Indeed, why allow Korea to have duty drawback, which is a benefit that has never been granted before, not even to developing countries such as the countries of the Mediterranean? What is the logic behind flexible rules of origin, the impact of which is to be feared, not only for the car industry, but also for the European textile industry? Why allow such distortions of competition and, above all, why set this precedent? In the face of these risks, and, unfortunately, of others, which I cannot expand on here but the details of which you know – you have just mentioned them – the Commission has proposed a last resort, the inclusion of a safeguard clause. However, you know, Commissioner, that the safeguard clause is not automatic and that it will be very difficult to implement and impossible to activate for five years. I will cite just one example to illustrate our fears. If the free trade agreement allows Korea to export 100 000 additional vehicles to Europe – it already exports 600 000 of them annually – 6 000 jobs will be lost. Conversely, Europe is terribly restricted, with each manufacturer being able to export just 1 000 vehicles to Korea, as part of a total European quota of 6 000 vehicles. At this time of crisis, which is having a particular effect on car workers, how do you explain Europe’s committing itself to such an agreement? Do you envisage a renegotiation of the controversial points that I have just mentioned? This is what a number of Member States and industrial sectors that I have just mentioned are calling for, anyway. Will you commit yourself at last, Commissioner, to ensuring greater transparency and to involving us MEPs to a greater extent? We, and the Commission, created the conditions for a negative image of the Polish plumber; let us not create a negative image of the Korean coach builder. Kader Arif (S&amp;D).

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by joining with the previous speakers in condemning in the harshest possible terms the coup d’état 
staged against the government of President Zelaya in Honduras. His arbitrary detention and his expulsion from the country are in breach of the constitutional order, which must be restored as quickly as possible. The military overthrow that led to Roberto Micheletti proclaiming himself as the new president brings to mind the darkest periods in the history of Central America that we have known, and this attack on democracy is unacceptable in our view. I therefore welcome the Organization of American States’ decision to suspend Honduras’ involvement in the organisation, and the acceptance of President Oscar Arias as a mediator helping to find a solution. However, I am also very concerned, Commissioner, about the commercial relations that the European Union maintains with this country. For several months negotiations have been taking place between the European Commission and Central America on a new-generation association agreement. Following the coup d’état
, meetings planned last week have been cancelled. We should be glad about that. I thought I understood you, but I should like to have more details. Is the Commission determined to suspend the negotiations until the institutional political situation in Honduras has returned to normal? That is what I and my political group are asking, but I should like to have more details concerning the Commission’s position on this point. Another issue that I wish to raise, Commissioner, is that of the Generalised System of Preferences Plus, from which Honduras benefits. Several organisations from civil society have reported arbitrary decisions and human rights violations since the coup d’état
, particularly as regards freedom of movement, association and expression. The European Commission has to be very firm on this issue. The GSP+ is an incentive, the benefits of which are dependent on clear commitments. The testimonies are more than enough to cast doubt on whether the State of Honduras is fulfilling its commitments under its self-proclaimed president. I therefore call on the Commission to launch an investigation into the possibility of temporarily withholding the preferences granted to Honduras under the GSP+. Karim Zéribi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is proposing that we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the single market and forge further ahead with its completion. In the field of transport, two areas are identified in Single Market Act II: rail and maritime transport. I am surprised not to see cabotage services provided by road, scheduled for 2013, mentioned here. This will have a massive impact on the environment and lead to more social dumping than is the case at present. I would like to think this was an oversight, though one might consider it a deliberate error. Commissioner, you can be very pleased with the achievements of the last 20 years, but you cannot hide the reality of the social landscape or the crisis affecting Europe on the job front. As far as the forthcoming reforms in both the maritime and the rail sectors are concerned, these are based on a one-size-fits-all approach, that of liberalisation. Commissioner, this headlong rush has to stop. The single market is not dogma. It is a tool that should serve economic development, environmental transition and the social wellbeing of our fellow citizens. We cannot reasonably take any more without introducing social and fiscal harmonisation measures that are effective with any future directive. There has to be a level playing field for everyone. My group will, in particular, be making sure that we avoid the abuses of the past and, for every area where the market is being liberalised, will demand that a social and environmental package be introduced so that competition is fair and brings development and prosperity for our continent.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to draw your attention to the issue of the Roma minority, which is very topical in France and in Europe. The European Union has, to its credit, invested heavily in its programmes to integrate the Roma populations. More than EUR 17 billion will be allocated over the period 2007-2013 via the European Social Fund (ESF), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and, to a lesser extent, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). However, there are numerous indications that these funds have been under-utilised. In Marseille, the city in which I was elected, 1 500 Roma live in inhumane and revolting conditions, which creates tensions. Expelling the Roma does not resolve their situation at all and does not address the real issue, which is their integration. We must act. Commissioner, you say that the integration of the Roma, who are Europeans, is as much the responsibility of the host country as it is of the country of origin. You are right. However, we must therefore strengthen control over the use of EU subsidies and ensure that the Commission reassesses, if necessary, the national strategies adopted. Furthermore, we should entrust the management of Structural Funds granted today to locally elected bodies, which will have an interest in solving the problem because they are closer to the citizen. Parliament will then have to ensure that the use of these funds is assessed regularly. Liem Hoang Ngoc,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the euro area is again entering recession. The exit strategy advocated by the Council and the Commission until last June has plunged us into crisis. Euroscepticism is gaining ground. In this context, the Van Rompuy report, which must define the next stage of economic and monetary union, has particular significance. Sadly, the Council has refused to involve Parliament fully in drafting this roadmap. Ms Thyssen’s report is therefore the opportunity for Parliament to invite itself to the debate in order to send a strong message. I salute the remarkable work done by Ms Thyssen, who has demonstrated the sort of constructive attitude that shows our fellow citizens that Parliamentary debate has a point. The point of this debate is to take stock of the levers so desperately lacking for the functioning of economic and monetary union. Firstly, an integrated banking union is needed to control the banks, guarantee deposits and resolve crises without taxpayers again having to foot the bill. Secondly, a budgetary union is needed, within which the serious budgetary approach of Member States is matched by support for sustainable development on a European scale. This union must be given a budgetary capacity fuelled by new own resources, allocation of which must be debated within the framework of the Union method, this being the only way to guarantee solidarity among the 27 Member States. Thirdly, a genuine democratic leap is needed, without which transfers of sovereignty will continue to be seen by our fellow citizens as so many powers commandeered by bureaucrats. Parliament, as the main agent of representative democracy, must therefore play a part at each stage of the European Semester. Parliament must be involved in the functioning of the European stability mechanism. Parliament must be able to monitor the troika, particularly when the International Monetary Fund itself declares that the troika has made a serious error. Last but not least, a social – fifth – pillar is needed to guarantee wage standards, preventing structural reforms from causing a recessionary spiral. A social pillar to prevent budgetary discipline from reducing the quality of public services and social protection. A social pillar to encourage integration of young people into the labour market and access to housing for all. A social pillar to reassure our fellow citizens, for whom Europe is synonymous with saving the banks on the one hand, but worsening most people’s circumstances on the other. That is the strong mandate that Parliament must give its President on the eve of the November and December Council meetings. The Council will hear this message even more clearly if tomorrow it receives – thanks to you, ladies and gentlemen– the largest possible majority. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, the October Council decided on a timetable for the implementation of June’s decisions. The banking union will therefore see the light of day in 2014. It will allow us to supervise 6 000 banks in the euro area. It will guarantee deposits and be responsible for resolving banking crises. This will prevent the taxpayers from having to pay the price once again, because the citizens, and workers in particular, are not the culprits responsible for the crisis; the real criminals are the greedy financiers. They have taken the role of police, accusing the citizens of always wanting too many social elements. However, the social pillar is exactly what is missing from your interim road map, Mr Van Rompuy; that and the democratic pillar. As a result, many of our citizens are becoming more Eurosceptic today. The members of the EP’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs affirmed in the Thyssen report that there cannot be genuine economic and monetary union without democracy and without a social pact. The European Parliament must have its say at each stage of the European Semester. It must be able to discuss the troika’s decisions. It must be involved in the European Stability Mechanism governance structure. Finally, budgetary discipline must, in each Member State, be accompanied by a substantial European budgetary capacity in order to deal with asymmetric shocks, as you say yourself, Mr Van Rompuy. However, this counter-cyclical fund must be financed using new, sustainable resources, and it must be managed under the Community method in order to prevent the collapse of the Union. Ladies and gentlemen, many of us agree that there cannot be a successful federal transition without solidarity, without social progress and without democratic progress. That is the message that our Parliament and its President must spread in the ongoing debate. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the ‘two-pack’ applies to France, as it does to most countries in the euro area. France, however, has just issued its latest government bonds at historically low rates. It has to get its economy growing again so as to reduce its deficits and continue to benefit from such rates. To that end, Ms Ferreira raises the possibility of proactive investment policies by proposing, like Mario Monti, to change the way deficits are calculated so as to distinguish the role of public investment. She also supports the creation of eurobonds, which are needed to curb speculation. Since the future of the euro is at stake, the conservatives would be taking on a serious responsibility if they rejected the amendments and compromises, including these two proposals. As for the Gauzès report, by generalising the reversed qualified majority principle, it places all the power in the hands of the Commission, whose recommendations are particularly controversial not only in Greece but also in France and elsewhere. The democratic debate should not be closed. Parliament should have the right to veto the Commission’s decisions. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has moved on to practical work and we have tried to improve its draft text in committee. We now have a basis of assessment including exchange transactions, derivatives, equities and bonds traded on the secondary market. Like the Commissioner, we want the financial transaction tax to be imposed on pension funds and undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), which, unfortunately, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wants to exclude. We also have two tax rates, including a lower rate for derivatives, which seems paradoxical given that we want to combat speculation. By and large, however, the compromise we are reaching will be an important step forward, especially if it obtains a large majority in plenary. This would send a strong signal to the Council, where political change in France is opening up new possibilities for European growth initiatives, funding for which could be achieved through the mobilisation of this first European tax instrument. This places the burden fairly and squarely on the financial sector, which is responsible for the crisis, and not on its victims, European citizens. The tax revenue will also help reduce the contribution of the Member States, which are being asked to reduce their deficit. In this way, Parliament is suggesting that it is not impossible to reconcile fiscal justice, deficit reduction and support for growth. This is a good omen, ladies and gentlemen, ahead of the informal European Council summit on growth, which is opening this evening. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur for the political will she has displayed in this report. We all know that some Member States manipulate their corporate tax base more or less secretly to reduce their real level of taxation and practise tax dumping. That is why we, as socialists and federalists, have always supported the idea of moving towards tax harmonisation in the European Union. Unfortunately, by proposing a consolidated base that was merely optional, the European Commission did not seek to take a first step towards harmonising corporate tax, but simply to create a tax optimisation instrument. This was not acceptable to our political grouping, since the Europe we believe in is not a self-service Europe serving only corporate interests.
 It is, above all, a political and social Europe built for all, involving everyone. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I have fought for months to change the logic of the Commission’s text radically, namely, to move from a voluntary to a compulsory system and introduce a minimum level of taxation. Negotiations were not easy but we succeeded in reaching agreement because, beyond our political differences – which are significant – all of us around the table shared an ambitious vision of Europe. Despite her initial reluctance, the rapporteur ultimately accepted the principle of a compulsory common consolidated corporate tax base for all large companies in the EU. Unfortunately, we did not manage to establish a minimum rate but the report clearly identifies the problems posed by too large a spread in rates and calls for the issue of rates to be re-examined when reviewing the application of this text. We will monitor this closely, because for us, it is an indispensable second phase. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I call on you to give overwhelming support to Ms Thyssen’s report. In doing so, we will send a strong message to the Council and, above all, to citizens, who are the first to suffer from the evils of tax competition. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

Blue-card question.

Mr President, Mr Gauzès, you speak of the sovereignty of the people, but you have also spoken of the ‘two-pack’ for which you are the rapporteur. You want to transpose – and I am talking to you about a European text – you want to transpose a treaty into secondary European legislation. You want to transpose the treaty of austerity together with its symbol, the leaden rule. It is a leaden rule that will plunge Europe into recession, as my fellow Member, Mr Canfin, said. You want to transpose this leaden rule into secondary legislation even before the peoples of Europe have been able to take a decision and ratify the treaty. Mr Gauzès, my question is a simple one: you speak of the sovereignty of the people, so are you going to withdraw your Amendment 9 from this ‘two-pack’, which shows true contempt for democracy? Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

) The intergovernmental treaty that the European governments are about to sign is unacceptable for two reasons. It is unacceptable in terms of the procedure adopted, which is anti-democratic and rides roughshod over half a century of the Community method. It is also unacceptable in terms of content, in that it is aimed at tightening the already suffocating straitjacket of the Stability Pact and imposing unprecedented austerity policies throughout Europe. These policies can do nothing but plunge us into a lasting recession, destroy our social model and make the poorest citizens pay the price for a crisis of which they are the first victims. They will not resolve the debt problem as austerity will kill consumption and investment and, with them, any hope of growth or the recovery of public finances. The fact the ECB has just granted the banks a loan of EUR 489 billion for three years at 1% interest, while Greece has a knife put to its throat, is proof that Europe has currently got things completely the wrong way round. Curiously, these banks are not suspected of ‘moral hazard’, in contrast to the Member States, which the ECB is not allowed to finance directly. They will therefore be able to buy back sovereign bonds at 6 or even 10% and continue their speculative activities with this free money. This is not the Europe we want. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D
),

 The new Treaty that the German right intends to push through would deprive the Member States of a budgetary policy by forcing them to implement austerity policies that are set to plunge Europe into recession without reducing deficits. Economic policy choices would be enshrined in the constitutions and placed under the authority of a Court of Justice. Automatic penalties would be applied to countries whose public deficit exceeds 3% of their GDP. However, this Treaty fails to include any measures for resolving the economic and social crisis: there is nothing about Eurobonds or about the ECB intervening on the primary market to purchase government bonds. Therefore, how can anyone be surprised about the rise in euroscepticism? We urgently need to show that a progressive economic strategy is possible. We call for the creation of a European treasury, the embryo of which could be the European Financial Stability Facility, and for an independent rating agency, attached to the European Court of Auditors. The power to rate sovereign debts would be taken away from private agencies, in which there are obvious conflicts of interest. We also propose the creation of an investment pact to revive the economy through the exclusion of investment expenditure from the calculation of public deficits. With an EU budget swelled by Eurobonds and the financial transaction tax, we would fund the upwards convergence of competitiveness levels and social and fiscal rules. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Draghi, ladies and gentlemen, this annual report has finally broken certain taboos. It calls on the Commission to create a European credit rating foundation and to consider temporarily suspending credit ratings for countries that require support from the Union. The report recognises the merit of the European Central Bank (ECB) repurchasing bonds on the secondary market, which has allowed banks to maintain their balance sheets and continue to borrow on the interbank market. This action prevented a liquidity crisis. Yet in order to resolve the sovereign debt crisis, the ECB needs to be authorised to intervene on the primary market when it becomes illiquid. Even Germany is struggling to obtain funds. Italian bonds are being issued at ever-higher rates. If there is no intervention, the risk of Italy defaulting will seriously compromise the health of the banks. The banks will approve fewer loans and will not be able to meet the new solvency ratio requirements. Parliament’s report also stresses the need for a European Treasury able to issue federal bonds at lower rates, as is the case in the United States. In the event of speculator activity, the ECB should be authorised to repurchase these eurobonds, like its counterparts in the US and the United Kingdom. Did you know that these two countries are generating funds at historically low rates, despite a rating downgrade for one of them? Ladies and gentlemen, we are not in the same situation as Germany in the 1920s – nowadays, production capacities are underused. Therefore, demand is not driving inflation. There is no cost inflation because we have wage moderation, or because the gloomy economy is keeping commodities costs low despite speculatory activity. We need to acknowledge that the time has come for bold monetary policies, given the current failure to recognise that budgetary orthodoxy is absurd in times of recession. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 The agreement of 27 October is flabbergasting. The austerity policies that it intends to include in the constitutions will plunge Europe into a recession where tax revenues will dry up and deficits will widen. They will increase the risks associated with holding sovereign debts, leading to higher interest rates. The banks will see their balance sheets deteriorate and will struggle to increase their capital. Only the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) would allow for a restructuring of debts and recapitalisations and defuse any new tension about rates. To do so, it would have to turn into the embryonic European Treasury, issuing Eurobonds which the European Central Bank (ECB) could buy back at a lower rate. There are no plans for this. The fund, which started off with EUR 440 billion, now only has EUR 250 billion. To raise the EUR 1 trillion supposed to reassure the markets, it will transform the sovereign debts held into derivatives to activate the ‘leverage effect’. However, the recession will increase the risk of defaults. We hardly dare imagine the effects of this securitisation of Italian and Spanish debts should these countries partly default. This agreement is explosive for the financial system, already under threat from austerity measures which are crippling growth. Turning to China rather than the ECB is detrimental to industry and employment in Europe. Liem Hoang Ngoc,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there will be no political Europe without a fiscal Europe. Unfortunately, the two issues that we are debating today demonstrate the Commission’s lack of ambition on that subject. As regards the system of taxation for parent companies with subsidiaries in other Member States, under the current directive, these groups are undertaxed, which is detrimental to public finances in the Member States. It has been a boon for transnational groups. In order to remedy this, I proposed in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that a parent company should only be exempt from paying tax on profits generated by subsidiaries on two conditions. Firstly, the parent company must hold the statutory minimum of 15% of company equity in another Member State for an uninterrupted period of at least two years in order to benefit from this tax regime. Sadly, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not accept that minimum period. Secondly, the profits distributed by a subsidiary to the parent company used to be taxed at a rate of 75% or more of the average tax rate in the EU Member States. I am pleased to say that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did agree to maintain the threshold of 70% of the average tax rate. The European Commission chose not to comment during our discussions, which was a pity. Consequently, Commissioner, we are left hoping that you will act on the message that we are sending, since Parliament is still not a colegislator on tax matters. The second symptom of your lack of concern about taxation is your failure to act when the Council quashed the directive on taxation of savings income. The ensuing vacuum has resulted in pick-and-mix bilateral agreements on the exchange of banking information, such as those concluded by the United Kingdom and Germany with Switzerland. Yet the Savings Tax Directive paved the way for automatic exchanges of information with several different tax havens, including Switzerland. The directive was the subject of a report that was adopted by a resounding majority in plenary. Although Mr Barnier has explained that there is no more money available to promote growth, applying the directive would allow us to generate EUR 200 billion for the public purse. A fiscal tool is essential if we are to recover from the crisis. Harmonised taxation is vital for an effective single market. Combating fraud and tax avoidance is crucial if we are to rebalance public accounts. For all these reasons, Commissioner, I can only urge you to do all you can to promote a fiscal Europe, in order to put an end to the Member States’ self-destructive rivalry. The main casualties of that rivalry are growth, public finances and solidarity among European citizens. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our fellow citizens are questioning the merits of austerity policies that are reducing their public services and squeezing their social security. Wherever these policies are rife, they are not succeeding in reducing public debt and bringing down unemployment. The contents of this ‘governance’ package – and I call them ‘contents’ deliberately – that we are discussing today are so ridiculous that even the economists are stunned, because they will prevent budgetary policy from adjusting to economic cycles. During the trialogue, the Commission representatives admitted to us themselves that they have not used any theoretical or econometric model as a basis for making sound predictions and recommendations. They admit that they are working on a purely intuitive basis. In the light of this, it is difficult to understand why the conservative, liberal and eurosceptic Members of this House have blindly attempted to toughen up the text proposed by the Commission. They are even less in a position to preach to us, considering that the governments led by friends of theirs have created these deficits through tax reductions that are as unfair as they are ineffective: is that not right, Mr Gauzès? They make grand statements about the Europe 2020 strategy, but they refuse to allow spending to prepare for the future, such as spending on investment, to be excluded from the calculation of the deficits. Yes, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, that is the crux of the debate as far as we are concerned! Let us reduce the deficits, yes, for example by going back on the tax gifts that have benefited the State’s creditors above all, but let us do it without sacrificing investment, training and jobs, because today’s investments are tomorrow’s jobs and the tax income that will follow, and this will allow us to reduce our deficits. This is the theorem that should appear on the frontispiece of the ‘governance’ package. My fellow conservative and liberal Members, some of you want to punish automatically States that are heretics to your dogma to the tune of billions of euros. They also want to punish countries that will not lower wages in order to regain their external balance. They believe that the deficits are primarily the product of bad intentions on the part of those States, as though the neoliberal model that you never question had not just been through its worst crisis since 1929, and as if it were not already leading to pressure on the buying power of ordinary people and causing a massive contraction in tax income: two problems that were at the root of the rise in private and public indebtedness in the first place. When it comes to the votes, socialists and democrats will send out a clear signal against this austerity package, which can only heighten the indignation that is rising throughout Europe. This clear signal is aimed at all workers in Europe and especially at our fellow citizens in France and Germany as they approach elections that will have a decisive impact on Europe’s future.

 Given the importance of this issue and the strict time constraints to which Parliament has had to work, we can all be pleased with what we have accomplished. In general, I agree with the priorities identified by the various reports, particularly the recognition of professional qualifications, the portability of pension rights, the rationalisation of procurement procedures, initiatives for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and access for all to certain basic banking services Certainly, in my opinion, other measures deserved to be highlighted, such as the issue of collective resources, but I am well aware that it was difficult to decide between these 50 proposals. I am also pleased that we were able to reach a compromise on the social clause, which states that any legislation on the Single Market should be subject to a social impact assessment and, if justified by the findings, should contain a reference to political and social rights. Finally, another reason for us to be satisfied is the fact that Parliament calls for guaranteed access, quality and affordability of services of general economic interest (SGEIs) and social services of general interest (SSGIs), and invites the Commission to take sectoral legislative initiatives in this area.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, 24 March, will be a symbolic day. In the first instance, it will be marked by the amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon that we have just voted for, which will allow a permanent European Stability Mechanism to be established. This mechanism allows the European Union to devise the first Eurobonds, which are designed to finance sovereign debt at low interest rates in the event of speculative attacks. In this respect, it is a shame that the process stopped halfway. To deal with the markets’ irrational exuberance, the revision of the Treaty ought to have been an opportunity to authorise the European Central Bank to do what the United States does and buy back public debt in the event of exchange rate tensions. The process is even more incomplete since the pay-off required is to implement the Competitiveness Pact, re-christened the Pact for the euro. This is the second symbol of tomorrow. This pact is backed unanimously by the Council, the Commission and the European Central Bank. Ladies and gentlemen, you all know the Washington Consensus: you loved it. Well, 24 March sees the birth of the ‘Brussels consensus’. The ‘Brussels consensus’ is the blind, roughshod application of neoliberal dogma: squeezing public services and the welfare state; wage austerity and minimal regulation of the financial markets. Ladies and gentlemen, the Council, the Commission and the ECB have short memories. They are proposing to transpose the Pact for the euro into the governance package so as to enshrine in our system the very policies that led to the economic crisis. In Spain, the UK, Ireland and elsewhere, the rise of household debt, which is fed by the finance industry, has been caused by none other than the crisis in buying power resulting from the pay restraint that has held sway for 20 years. The Pact for the euro unfortunately proposes to make wage austerity a permanent fixture. As for public debt, as well as being a consequence of the economic crisis, it is also a result of pointless tax reductions everywhere, advocated by liberals and conservatives. There was no explosion of public expenditure in Europe: quite the contrary. Budget and wage austerity, combined with the interest rate rises already planned by the European Central Bank, will end up killing off internal demand in Europe and killing off the recovery without reducing deficits. Tomorrow, we will be side by side with employees demonstrating against this ‘Brussels consensus’: this is the third symbol of 24 March. If we do not want to see a return of the likes of the brown shirts, whom Europe was created to stand against, the people’s elected representatives must stand with the people to denounce policies that are as unjust as they are ineffective.

 I am anxious to thank Mr Schwab and the shadow rapporteurs for their work. The Commission’s initial proposal was unacceptable because it intended to harmonise fully the rules concerning consumer rights, without systematically bringing them into line with the most favourable national legislation. In other words, many Member States would have had to remove from their national legislation provisions that in fact granted better protection to consumers. In France, two major acquis
 would have to be abandoned as a result: the ‘latent defect’ rule and the ruling that a doorstep seller is prohibited from collecting payment before the end of the cooling-off period. However my socialist colleagues and I succeeded in getting this approach altered and in making minimum harmonisation the norm. We also managed to enhance consumer rights on a whole range of points, in particular concerning information that has to be provided by the seller and provisions pertaining to the cooling-off period. One problem remains however: chapter V. We cannot accept that the rules on unfair terms be fully harmonised, because that would deprive Member States of their ability to react when faced with commercial practices that change daily and sometimes involve serious risks for consumers.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are debating today offers genuine advances. I am thinking, in particular, of Eurobonds, which the Union will need in order to finance the Europe 2020 strategy. Unfortunately, the right rejected in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs the principle of a tax on financial transactions at European level, despite having voted in favour of it in June. Its arguments for rejecting a European tax on financial transactions as a prelude to a global tax are the same as those put forward by the supporters of tax havens. It tells us that implementing a tax at European level alone would be disastrous for our financial sector. It also says that there would be a flight of capital from Europe. My answer to that is: so what if there is? The current volume of financial transactions is excessive compared to the needs of the real economy. Implementing this tax solely in Europe would help deflate the bubble. Furthermore, if the volume of speculative capital transactions, such as the credit derivatives at the origin of the crisis, were somewhat reduced, it would really help to consolidate the balance sheets of our banks. They would have a much greater incentive to finance the real economy. I would point out to those who are using the absence of an impact assessment for cover that no impact assessment was performed before the green light was given for a proliferation of derivatives. It is time, ladies and gentlemen, for all MEPs to face up to their responsibilities. The European Union must not continue to tag along behind a G20 dominated by the United States and China. It must lead the way in reforming our financial system. That is why I cannot support a text which chooses to overlook a tax on financial transactions. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 I would like to thank Mrs Weiler for this high quality report and the outcome of the negotiations with the Council, as the first reading agreement includes all the key elements that were put forward by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and which were approved in the vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. I am especially pleased to see that private companies and public authorities are now placed on an equal footing. The Commission’s initial proposal contained far more stringent penalties for public authorities, a position which our group felt was unacceptable as, unlike private undertakings, public sector bodies are not focused primarily on profit but rather operate in the general interest. The fact that the lender is entitled to compensation for recovery expenses also represents real progress since, up to now, many companies, particularly SMEs, have chosen not to reclaim late-payment interest from borrowers for the simple reason that the cost of the relevant procedures outweighed any financial gains. Finally, the maximum payment period of 30 days set out in the text seems reasonable, given that there is some scope for flexibility, notably for public healthcare bodies, a point that our group deemed particularly important.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, the ECOFIN Council approved the principle of the European Semester. As a federalist, I can only welcome such progress. However, coordinating budgetary policy is one thing; defining their content is another. That is why strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact is a serious mistake. The austerity treatment dogmatically imposed on the whole of Europe is already making its initial effects felt. Spain and Ireland are experiencing ever more difficulties, and the Markit survey, published at the end of August, shows that this treatment is responsible for the stagnation in European growth and, before long, the stagnation in German growth. The series of repressive measures outlined on the agenda of the next informal ECOFIN meeting is even more serious. Imposing automatic financial sanctions on States that are already facing budget problems is irresponsible. It will inevitably fuel the criticisms in all the Member States with regard to their national contributions to the EU budget. Two and a half million citizens expressed the first opposition to the austerity package on the streets of France yesterday. Instead of preserving social safety nets and establishing the social harmony in the EU that is necessary for the recovery, the Council and the Commission are destroying them. Do they measure the impact of such decisions only by the increasing level of Euroscepticism among citizens? For the sake of European integration and of the citizens for whom it is being undertaken, it must be acknowledged, ladies and gentlemen, that strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact is an economic aberration. It is also a serious political mistake. Liem Hoang Ngoc,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the own-initiative report on which we are voting this week is of particular symbolic importance at a time when the markets are unable to assess the risks associated with the economic situation in the euro area. Having demanded severe budget adjustment policies, they now doubt the capacity of Member Sates to kick-start their growth and, hence, to obtain the tax revenue necessary to pay the interest on their debt. Unfortunately, no risk assessment can be carried out in the deeply uncertain context in which the global economy now finds itself. Such an assessment is all the more important in the European Union, where the production capacity utilisation rate is at an all-time low. Instead of investing, companies are mothballing machines because, despite the initial signs of recovery at the end of 2009, demand is lacking. Growth would even end up going into reverse if restrictive measures were to nip the recovery in the bud. The first aim of our report was precisely to determine the optimum time for launching policies for emerging from the crisis. We proposed maintaining the support measures until the normal production capacity utilisation rate was restored. We therefore suggested ratifying the principle of anti-cyclical budgetary policies, which were successfully established during the first phase of the crisis in 2008 and 2009, and which are in line with the spirit of the reform of the 2005 Stability Pact. These policies entail using automatic stabilisers, in other words, in earmarking surpluses from the primary budget for debt repayment at the top of the cycle, and in allowing Member States to borrow the resources necessary for stimulus packages at the bottom of the cycle. We are currently at the bottom of the cycle. Interest rates are definitely under pressure and are threatening the sustainability of the debt. This being the case, the European Central Bank was right to announce that it would buy back some debt to enable Member States to diversify their sources of finance. Nevertheless, in addition to the fact that this concept of sustainability has never been defined in the economic literature, can the risk premiums demanded by the markets be deemed justifiable? No, if we consider that risk in the mortgage derivatives market, just as in the public-debt market, is impossible to assess. This is why, in our report, we proposed that particular attention be paid to the structural deficit indicator rather than the focus being … (The President cut off the speaker)
 This is why, in our report, we proposed that particular attention be paid to the structural deficit indicator rather than the focus being on the current account deficit, the scale of which is due to the deterioration in the actual budget deficit. This is the result of the crisis, which has weakened growth and concomitant tax revenue. This revenue has also been adversely affected by the lowering of taxes, which did not have the expected impact on supply. Our report seeks to offer three recommendations combined with some operational indicators. The first is to maintain support measures until the recovery has been consolidated. The second is to monitor the structural deficits, which are still close to equilibrium, despite the deterioration in actual budget deficits, in order to send a reassuring signal to the markets as to the state of public finances. The third is to assess the efficiency of tax expenditure and, in particular, of certain tax reductions which are related to the fall in tax revenue. Unfortunately, for the liberals and the conservatives in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, common sense counts for little; the impact of the crisis counts for little; and the fact that the massive debt is also due to the bank bail-out plans counts for little. Only their blind faith in the efficiency of the financial markets counts; only dogmatic compliance with a manifestly out-of-date Stability Pact counts. They do not see any need to create the tools required for economic governance, which is essential in order to strengthen the Union. It is a case of putting Europe on a starvation diet and doggedly trying to meet the criteria in the pact without any guarantee of success and at the risk of destroying the recovery, and too bad for social cohesion. That is the position that they have defended in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Since that vote, the economic health of Europe has deteriorated further. The European Central Bank and the Commission have finally come up with monetary and budgetary instruments which should enable us to improve economic governance in the euro area. However, the markets have fallen once again, unsettled as they are by the austerity plans. The Ecofin Council had to start all over again on Monday. Against this background, the amendments which we are tabling are, all in all, very moderate; and we are tabling some new ones too. They argue for flexible implementation of the Stability Pact, so that an unwelcome austerity cure can be avoided. They advocate a public credit rating agency to shield Member States from the diktat of the markets. These are the signals that Parliament must send out. Mr Karas, the time for ideological knee-jerk reactions has passed, as has the time for short-term national electoral moves. Europe needs policies which are motivated by a real desire to strengthen the Union. If you and your group are not up to this task, if you are no longer capable of representing the general interest, you can be sure that our citizens will be able to draw their own conclusions, for the future of the euro area is now at stake. Liem Hoang Ngoc,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, two taboos have been broken in recent weeks. Firstly, the ECB can now monetise sovereign debts. Secondly, EU expenditure can now be financed by borrowing and, in particular, when the stabilisation and support funds are created. There is a third taboo, which unfortunately has not been broken, and it is the Stability and Growth Pact, which some Members of this House are dogmatically demanding be strengthened. Commissioners, we socialists are in favour of federalism. We are in favour of the coordination of budget policies. However, if the coordination of budget policies means overriding national parliaments so as to put their citizens on a starvation diet, then I fear that that might be a fine EU idea which will itself end up starving to death. This is the real threat which we are all facing at the moment. Commissioners, the austerity plans in Greece, Spain, Portugal and France do not have any chance of succeeding. I ask you to acknowledge this. Liem Hoang Ngoc,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Giegold’s report is particularly significant given the current macro-economic debate. This report is all the more relevant given the fact that its author is a German MEP who wanted to draw the attention of Europeans to the distorted effects, for the countries of the euro area, of the German strategy of reducing labour costs in the single currency system. The German Government is, in fact, about to drag the euro area and the whole of the European Union into generalised wage deflation with damaging macro-economic consequences. Particularly in the absence of consistent structural funds and sufficient budgetary resources, and faced with the impossibility of devaluation, Member States with current accounts in deficit are condemned, in order to resist, to trim their wages and reduce the perimeter of their social security systems. The result is firstly a slowdown in internal demand which, since the second quarter of 2008, has led to negative growth, and this was even before the start of the liquidity crisis. Secondly, we are seeing a rise in the personal debt of households with modest incomes and means, whose purchasing power is no longer increasing. Their debt to acquire homes was fed by the whole deregulated financial machinery, in Spain, in the United Kingdom and in Ireland, with the disastrous consequences we have observed in the subprime crisis. Ladies and gentlemen, listening to the debates in committee, a significant number of MEPs would seem to be forgetting the lessons of this crisis. This crisis is far from behind us. The current recovery is all the more fragile given the fact that Europe is continuing with wage deflation and the Commission, but also the President of the Eurogroup and the President of the European Central Bank – whom we heard on Monday – are calling on the Member States to prematurely adopt exit policies that are comparable to real austerity plans. These policies risk nipping growth in the bud when it has barely become positive again, even though capacity utilisation rates remain low. These policies will fail to reduce the deficits in Greece, in Spain and elsewhere, because the expected tax revenue will fail to materialise also. They will exacerbate unemployment and will fuel social tensions. The Giegold report has the merit of drawing attention to some of these macro-economic imbalances. Unfortunately, the final version, amended by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, refuses to condemn wage deflation. However, on the whole, the debate opened by Mr Giegold may be beneficial at a time when neoliberal dogma thrown into doubt by the crisis is back in force in Parliament, in the Council and in the Commission.

Mr President, Madam President, I thank Mrs Thun Und Hohenstein for the conscientiousness of her work and the overall quality of her report. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I am delighted that the vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has made it possible to integrate into the final report a number of ideas that we wanted to see emerge. The first is the need to adopt a more qualitative approach in respect of the implementation of the Internal Market Scoreboard, enabling the causes of the transposition deficit to be identified. We do not underestimate the usefulness of the statistical data and the pressure that comes from promoting the EU’s good and bad students, but in our opinion, the Commission ought to be more ambitious and try to make this scoreboard a tool designed to appreciate the difficulties encountered by the Member States within the context of the transposition process. All the more so since we all know that the transposition deficit may sometimes be due not to ill will by the Member States, but to the mediocre quality of the European legislation to be transposed. The second aspect I focused on is the need to strengthen dialogue between the Commission and the Member States throughout the transposition period. The more the information exchanges take place upstream, the more it will be possible to prevent the risk of non­transposition or incorrect transposition. The report does, however, pose a problem on one point: this relates to paragraph 10, which did not initially appear in Mrs Thun Und Hohenstein’s draft report. This paragraph proposes the creation of an internal market test for all new proposed legislation. We are strongly opposed to this since such a test seems to us to be pointless at best and dangerous at worst. Indeed, the review of any barriers to the internal market already takes place during the impact studies carried out by the European Commission with each new legislative proposal. We would not like this internal market test to be used as a pretext for undermining social or environmental advances. We could not agree to it in those circumstances. Liem Hoang Ngoc,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this period of crisis, public finances have been heavily used, initially to save the financial system and then to cushion the social and economic impact. In this context, there is much talk of public deficits, the spending of Member States is being attacked, but the fall in tax receipts is allowed to fade into the background. One forgets that, each year in the European Union, EUR 200 billion evades taxation, and these are resources which could have been used for essential recovery policies, resources which would allow us calmly to face up to what some are calling, in inverted commas, the demographic time bomb. This is why the texts that we are discussing today are so important. The introduction of common tools and absolute transparency between the Member States in the area of debt recovery are vital steps if we are to ensure that no citizen, no company, can evade their fiscal responsibility, and that everyone contributes to the collective effort. We must give the tax authorities of each country in the Union the resources to fulfil their missions. We must also emphasise the extent to which a healthy fiscal policy is essential. Everyone is currently concerned about Greece. We are seeing today the extremes to which the lack of an effective fiscal apparatus leads. It is not merely the crisis that is harming the Karamanlis government; it is, above all, its predecessor’s lack of political courage in failing to reform Greece’s fiscal administration and thus to create an effective tax recovery tool. We hope, in this matter, that the Union will use all of the resources at its disposal to confirm its solidarity with Greece. I hope that the vote we take on Wednesday confirms the vote in committee and results in some encouraging tax recovery texts. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

Mr President, to my mind, the Commission’s proposed Agenda for Change raises many questions, chief amongst them the matter of how exactly the principle of differentiation is to be applied. The Commission’s wish is that, from 2014, the countries receiving EU development aid should be chosen purely on the basis of the criterion of per capita wealth. As Baroness Ashton has said, this is not just a matter of money; it merits a proper policy debate on how we define our priorities for international cooperation. And I do not think this differentiated approach is consistent with the spirit of the Cotonou Agreement. I firmly believe that those ACP countries that have recorded good economic performances should be encouraged in their transition towards more sustainable growth; they should not be improperly penalised for having managed to secure growth through discipline, good governance and prudent economic policy. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

Mr President, all of us are well aware of how tedious and time-consuming negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) can be. My feeling is that this has indeed been the case with this issue. On the one hand, it is not hard to see that only 18 of the 36 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries which have embarked on or signed an EPA have ratified it. The remainder are therefore encouraged to conclude and implement an agreement quickly, if they do not want to see their negotiation efforts ruined by, for example, the deadline of 2014. On the other hand, we have all known, since 2007, that this regulation was merely temporary, being incompatible with the rules of the World Trade Organisation. These facts therefore lead me to believe that our rapporteur’s proposal is the best possible compromise if we want to give the Commission services and the ACP countries the time they need to conclude their EPA negotiations. Nevertheless, if the date 1 January 2016 does not win a majority in tomorrow’s vote, I would call on my fellow MEPs to reject the Commission’s proposal. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank our two rapporteurs for the work they have done on this issue. It was necessary because we started from a very low base with the Commission’s basic proposal: no specific mention of the outermost regions, which are directly affected by competition from Latin American countries; no automatic activation of the stabilisation mechanism; no possibility for Parliament to ask for a safeguard investigation to be initiated; non-compliance of social and environmental standards as possibly constituting an unfair competitive advantage. That is why it is extremely important that tomorrow’s vote validates the progress made on these points in the Committee on International Trade (INTA). Nonetheless, it is not sufficient, because we know that the activation thresholds for both these regulations are so high that they render these mechanisms practically inoperable. Furthermore, the Commission must provide for an additional financial envelope to support EU banana production. We must bear in mind that numerous jobs are at stake in these European regions, which already have record unemployment rates. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, faced with the profound changes which our world is experiencing today, the European Union is duty bound to reform its generalised system of preferences. Like all compromises, this is no exception. Although it is satisfactory from a strictly commercial point of view, it is far from perfect, because we must bear in mind that this regulation is aimed at developing countries. By developing its new paradigm of differentiation, the Commission says that it wants to refocus its activities to help the poorest countries. At first sight, this seems to be completely acceptable to us. However, in order to achieve this, the Commission has developed a strictly accounting approach that is based upon the sole criterion of GDP per capita. We can clearly see the limits of this approach. What about the numerous middle income developing countries whose economies are not very diversified and which are vulnerable to climatic uncertainties? The compromise found with the Council does not resolve this issue and that is why I call upon my colleagues to vote in favour of the three amendments that will be tabled on this text. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

 I welcome the position adopted by Parliament today. I would like to address two key points in this report. It was important that Parliament spoke out strongly against the Commission’s proposal to reduce the specific allocation for outermost regions (ORs) by almost half. This cut in funding is all the more unfair in that it affects the money set aside to compensate for the disadvantages of these regions which, by definition, are not decreasing. They are described as structural and permanent in our Treaties. Consequently, these regions would be the only territories, and I mean the only ones, under the cohesion policy that would see a cut in their funds, which would not be justified by growth effects or a change in category of regions. Secondly, I would like to focus on our call for a comparative analysis of pricing in these regions. Economic mechanisms that go against the principles of the single market seem to be at work here and often lead to extremely worrying social movements. In this area, we need to have better informed and targeted action to meet this urgent demand of the people. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D
)

Madam President, Commissioner, this initiative comes from a good place. Work on education and training must be a priority when it is not only essential for the employability of our young people but also an investment for the future, a gauge of our ability to maintain dynamic and sustainable development. That being said, I am still extremely dubious about how consistent European action is overall. If the EU is not capable of implementing real solutions for growth, if it is still obsessed with punitive austerity, sterile austerity, austerity for austerity’s sake, there will be no growth for small and medium-sized enterprises, no jobs for young people and all of our efforts will be in vain. Similarly, if the fight against youth unemployment is our priority, how do you explain your proposal to reduce certain funds dedicated to the outermost regions by almost 50%, Commissioner? These regions where youth unemployment is at over 60%, these regions which you promised to protect, find themselves being sanctioned more than any others. Where is the consistency? Where is the justice? This decision is unacceptable and we are against. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

 This DCI/BAM text brushes aside the mandate that was given to Parliament’s negotiating team, which was to observe the spirit and the letter of the Treaty of Lisbon, to place Parliament on an equal footing with the Council in all programming decisions relating to the choice of strategic priorities and financial allocations, and not to set a negative precedent for Parliament prior to the forthcoming negotiations on the future external aid financing instruments 2014-2020. By applying Article 291 TFEU on strategic programming decisions, Parliament’s power of scrutiny will be more limited than it was with the comitology procedure under the old Treaty. All this is a result of the shameful blackmail by the Council, which was threatening to block the entire package of measures if Parliament rejected any one of the four texts that were voted on. I therefore voted against this text, because our Parliament had a duty to defend its rights as set out in the Treaty of Lisbon, whilst demonstrating that its plenary remained sovereign in the face of the Council’s efforts at destabilisation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our coordinator Thijs Berman could not be with us in the end this evening for personal reasons. However, I know that he shares my views on this issue fully. The conciliation on this legislative package was tedious and time-consuming and, while the outcome on the human rights instrument and the enlarged Industrialised Countries Instrument (ICI Plus) is satisfactory, we still have a very long way to go with regard to the Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM). The compromise reached on this text thus brushes aside the mandate that was given to our negotiating team, which was to place Parliament on an equal footing with the Council in all of the programming decisions relating to the choice of strategic priorities and financial allocations. I say this because it is indeed Parliament’s powers and the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon itself that are we are talking about here. The choice of programming priorities is a highly political decision, in which our Parliament must have its say. By categorically refusing to grant Parliament any such power of oversight and by employing shameful blackmailing tactics, the Council has, once again, made a reprehensible ideological withdrawal. Member States must, however, understand that the European Union’s external actions are now a responsibility that is shared between our institutions. That is why Parliament must retain its authority and reject the proposal on the BAM. This is the only means we have of showing the Council and the Commission that Parliament wishes to see greater transparency in Community decisions. If we lose this battle, it could lead to an absurd situation in which we would have to wait for a new Treaty in order to obtain, at long last, the powers that are in fact already conferred on us by the Treaty of Lisbon.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to highlight Parliament’s support for the creation of a category of intermediate regions and I would point out that this will in no way – contrary to what some have said – be an additional burden on the Community budget. What we are proposing here is a revolution in the concept of transition with an unchanged budget. Our desire is to move towards a fairer system which helps those regions that have substantial difficulties. This transitional zone between 75 and 90% of European GDP is a real commitment towards a consolidated cohesion policy for the years to come. Furthermore, I am delighted that our resolution has confirmed Parliament’s commitment towards the outermost regions. The latter are subject to specific and permanent disadvantages which justify this solidarity effort, in order for them to effectively be the Union’s interface with the world. Patrice Tirolien,

 Madam President, the position unanimously adopted today by our Parliament shows just how vitally important the issue of implementing powers is to this House. Nevertheless, to turn to the subject of the Banana Accompanying Measures, this agreement is embarrassing with regard to our ACP banana-producing partners. Indeed, one year after these countries legitimately obtained compensation from the Commission, they have still not received the funds, even though the Geneva Agreement is hitting them hard. Therefore, they are the ones I am addressing again today when I say that it is precisely because we want to relay our demands even further that this House must have its say in the EU’s strategy and general guidelines for external aid. We are determined not to fall into the trap set by the Commission and the Council. Transparency of European decisions must be at the heart of our work. This is the very spirit of the Treaty and the essence of history. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing. 
– (FR)
 It is impossible to separate the Geneva Agreement from the other agreements that the Commission has subsequently negotiated. Shortly after the Geneva Agreement was signed, Colombia and Peru obtained a greater tariff reduction, thus proving that the agreement provides no legal certainty and has not settled the banana dispute as it claims. This differential treatment prompted Ecuador and Guatemala to demand equal treatment and threaten to lodge further appeals at the WTO. Furthermore, this agreement seriously harms a sector that provides countless jobs not only in our ACP partner countries but also in the outermost regions (ORs). The aid the EU is providing to support producers in the ORs has been calculated on the basis of the laws approved at the WTO in 2006. However, neither the December 2009 agreement nor the agreement with the Andean countries was anticipated in the POSEI. As for the aid earmarked for ACP producers, it is not sufficient to enable them to adapt to the new tariff situation. To give one’s assent to this agreement is to support the Commission in a strategy that is inconsistent with the EU’s effort in favour of the ORs and the ACP countries. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to focus my speech on Mr Goerens’ report, which deals with the ACP Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM). As I myself come from one of the only European regions to produce bananas, I can only show solidarity with the ACP producers in question. Solidarity, first and foremost, because a strong historical link unites the European Union to these countries, and we should do our utmost to ensure that they, too, are able to maximise the benefits of globalisation, of which they are, more often than not, the first victims. Solidarity, also, because the trade concessions generously granted by the Commission to the WTO are in danger of dealing a fatal blow to this agricultural sector in our ACP partner countries. Solidarity, but definitely not naivety, lastly, since the proposal for a BAM regulation as tabled by the Commission put much too much emphasis on the economic diversification aspect. Given the loss of tariff preference that resulted from the WTO agreement, this programme’s main goal is clearly to ensure the sustainability of ACP banana exports and hence, to help make them competitive. Furthermore, let us be honest, the funds set aside by the BAM are by no means enough and do not extend over a long enough period to make diversification happen. Finally, I would add that, if we are aware of the urgency of the situation, we can accept these accompanying measures being financed through the extensive redeployment of heading IV of the budget. The Council must be responsible and work towards finding a viable solution for the multiannual financing of this programme. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome this debate today. It once again shows the need for the Union to appreciate and make the most of its regional diversity. At this time when we are negotiating the new 2014-2020 framework programmes, I think it important to emphasise the amendments from which specific regions must benefit. Issues of continuity and territorial cohesion must be at the heart of our concerns. The development of mountain regions, islands and sparsely populated areas, however, requires more than just a set of derogations. We must adopt a horizontal approach. We must put in place instruments capable of making Union action in all areas coexist in synergy, thereby increasing their added value. Moreover, as a representative of an outlying region, I look forward to the new Union strategy on the outermost regions, which the Commission services have promised for early 2011.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when this text came before the Committee on Regional Development, I managed to introduce the idea of an extension of the exemption authorising the production of reconstituted milk in Martinique and Guadeloupe, following the example of the sustainable growth model which proved its worth in Madeira. Unfortunately, there was no consensus on this position at the last trialogue. This is regrettable for two reasons. Firstly, in terms of substance, dairy production in the French overseas departments would offer multiple unmissable opportunities: the strengthening of the cattle industry, self-sufficiency in a basic foodstuff and the creation of jobs. Secondly, in terms of content, our Parliament as a whole was unable to reach a decision on my proposal since it wanted to pass this text at first reading via an informal procedure that I oppose. Be that as it may, our work on this POSEI regulation will continue very soon during the mid-term review of this regulation. At that point, I will again request an exemption in the other French overseas departments. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

Mr President, is Haiti condemned to misfortune? Since its independence, natural disasters have given way to political catastrophes there, and here we are today faced with a tragedy of historic proportions. There are dead, injured, countless destroyed buildings and the ruin of national political structures and cooperation structures. We must beat fate. The European Union must participate in this twin emergency and reconstruction effort. We owe it to our numerous ties with Haiti, ties that are, first and foremost, historic: a former colony, Haiti was the most prosperous of them all; secondly, diplomatic: the Cotonou Agreement makes the island a privileged partner; and, finally, geographical, since Haiti is a neighbour of the European Union thanks to the outermost regions. Moreover, the crisis in Haiti represents the first test of the new European External Action Service, which you head up, Mrs Ashton. That has been conclusive up to now. This disaster also underlines the challenges and the improvements that we must make to this structure, since the solidarity movement of our continent aside, the US reaction raises questions about our mobilisation capacity. Thus, the remarkable efforts in favour of European coordination, the Member States’ contributions, must not conceal the difficulty of the discussions concerning the deployment of the European Gendarmerie Force. While it is crucial for the European Union’s expenditure to be guided by the United Nations, these difficulties lead to the conclusion that the European Union must equip itself with an autonomous, integrated structure with the means to deal with tasks as complex as a humanitarian emergency. Finally, the reconstruction phase represents an immense challenge. There is no shortage of tasks: political, administrative, economic, social and environmental. We are perhaps at year zero of a new era for Haiti. This is a major political challenge for a Europe that must assert itself as a visible leader in this process. Patrice Tirolien,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Guinea is currently being rocked by tragic events that have shocked the international public and flouted the law. Indeed, on 28 September 2009, the military junta led by Captain Dadis Camara carried out the bloody repression of a peaceful demonstration bringing together all of the opposition parties. Now, the Cotonou agreements base relations between the European Union and its ACP partners on respect for human rights and democratic principles. Therefore, Captain Dadis Camara’s unilateral decision to postpone the elections and to refuse to raise the issue of his candidacy for Guinean president is a serious failure to honour the commitments made to hold free and transparent elections within one year. The European Union must therefore take immediate action in line with the principles and the permanent values that underpin its action so that this violence, which represents so many human rights violations, stops. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the compromise resolution is fully in line with our values and principles, but I am particularly anxious to emphasise here Article 10 of this text, namely the suspension of the fisheries agreement protocol between the European Union and the Republic of Guinea until the democratic process has begun. I can hear people wondering whether such a decision would have disastrous socio-economic consequences for the population but, faced with the violence of 28 September, we must recognise that the Guinean Government is scarcely concerned about the living conditions of its citizens and that it leaves us with no other option than to be firm. Since its independence in 1958, Guinea has only ever known dictatorial regimes. Patrice Tirolien,

Mr President, the worrying developments concerning the political situation and security in Guinea require a firm response by the European Union. Indeed, as you know, on 28 September 2009, troops under the Guinean Government carried out the bloody repression of a peaceful demonstration uniting all of the opposition parties, causing 157 deaths and injuring more than a thousand people, some of whom suffered particularly vile instances of rape and mutilation. The Republic of Guinea is a country that has experienced only two dictatorial regimes since its independence in 1958. It is time for this infernal spiral to come to an end. The European Union, its Member States and its institutions had already condemned Moussa Dadis Camara’s coup d'état
 on 28 December 2008. As is procedure, the Council then applied Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement to establish a road map with the Guinean authorities, to be used as a framework for democratic transition. This list of measures included, in particular, the organisation of free and transparent elections within a year and the commitment that members of the CNDD, notably Moussa Dadis Camara, would not stand in these elections. Captain Camara’s decision to postpone the organisation of elections until spring 2010 and his refusal to raise the issue of whether he would stand for the Guinean Presidency were a sign of what was to come, with the current escalation. Thus, the demonstration that was bloodily repressed on 28 September was aimed precisely at calling on the junta to honour its commitments. The reaction of the government in office in Conakry shows its true intentions quite clearly: to eliminate all forms of democratic opposition in order to remain in power. In response, the international community has unanimously condemned these violent actions and the Guinean regime. Outraged by these massacres, our Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries recently refused, quite rightly, to vote for the Fisheries Agreement between the European Union and Guinea. Today, and in light of the latest events, the European Parliament would like to know the decisions the Council intends to take to address this situation. First of all, does the Council intend to push for the creation of an international commission of inquiry on the events of 28 September? How does the Council intend to act to ensure that the CNDD respects its commitments, namely to organise free and transparent elections as soon as possible, without the participation of Moussa Dadis Camara or another member of the CNDD? With regard to Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, what measures does the Council intend to take against the Guinean junta? Finally, what concrete commitments has the Council made to support the different initiatives run by ECOWAS, the African Union and the International Contact Group on Guinea? Pervenche Berès,

 Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs sees this end-of-year meeting as of major significance, since in order to achieve a genuine economic and monetary union we must revisit its foundations, which clearly did not withstand the crisis in which we find ourselves. The work done by this Parliament, under the responsibility of Ms Thyssen – whom we all thank for the excellent quality of the work – is meant to make clear, to define, Parliament’s position with a view to this major European Council meeting in December. I am therefore surprised by the absence of Herman Van Rompuy, its President, for whom this work is intended. In addition, I consider that the result of our vote here will give our sherpas a mandate to represent us in the negotiations in preparation for this work. We also consider that this meeting cannot be downplayed or underestimated in the light of the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework. Rewriting a genuine economic and monetary union must remain the priority. In this area, it is necessary to raise the social issue: we have been greatly struck by the fact that the document put on the table by Mr Van Rompuy in June defines four pillars, without ever mentioning the social dimension. Yet if you look at the Treaty of Maastricht, if you look at the current state of economic and monetary union, it is obvious that there is an imbalance between the economic policies defined in Article 121 and the employment policies defined in Article 148. However, if you rebuild economic and monetary union on the basis of Mr Van Rompuy’s proposals, without taking account of this original balance, you will destabilise the entire mechanism. Moreover, Parliament, our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, also sets great store by parliamentary control, democratic control, and therefore the chance for Parliament to participate, under the ordinary legislative procedure, in the Annual Growth Survey establishing the framework for this European Semester. A final point, Mr President, to highlight an element not mentioned often enough. If we want the troikas to succeed, they must be expanded to include the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which has today denounced the failure to abide by the ILO fundamental conventions in Greece, following the work of the troika. A genuine economic and monetary union cannot ignore the very foundations of the European social model. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, here are three debates one after the other in our order of business, in which you are at the heart of the discussion. You have led some of these debates with Commissioner Andor, which is right, as they discuss industrial policy, which is also at the heart of European jobs. However, a key figure is missing from your debate – that is, Commissioner Barnier – because it is evident that, behind several strategies that are at play, it is strategies for financing the economy that lead to the unravelling of the industrial fabric of our regions, and it is also the stitch you will need to knit, if you will permit the expression. I therefore thank you for having taken the initiative of this working group, which is a logical link between the reasoning on raw materials and that on the car industry. What is required is a global strategy that combines the issue of research and development with the issue of quality and jobs. I am always struck by the extent to which Europeans have been mobilised and shocked at the idea that they could no longer control access to rare earths as if it were a strategic issue, rather like what the Americans have sometimes done. Yet when considering the issue of iron and steel, Europeans do not consider it just as strategic for our economies. We allow Mr Mittal to behave simply like a financier and, contrary to everything we have learned in our economics textbooks, rather than create added value, he tries to go up the added value chain by destabilising and destroying production units on the European sites so he can go and buy mines, where he can organise speculation better. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament will, in adopting Mr Ferber’s report, draw important lessons from MiFID I by adopting a text that ensures that almost all financial transactions will have to take place on regulated venues. That is the meaning we must give this text. High-frequency trading, a technique allowing a large number of orders to be executed in a few milliseconds, will now be highly constrained. The crisis has brought to light the abusive practices linked to the use of high-frequency trading by some financial players, disrupting the functioning of financial markets to obtain considerable profits. The position adopted by Parliament is a move in the right direction by discouraging use of this practice; it will help to put finance back where it belongs, that is to say, serving the real economy and long-term investment. With this report, Parliament also wishes to tackle food speculation, which can be devastating for entire populations, by introducing position limits for the various players operating on trading venues. The destabilising effects of commodity speculation are increasingly clear, particularly on foodstuff markets. With this in mind, the proposals adopted today are a first step in the right direction, insofar as they impose limits on positions that may be taken by those operating on trading venues. This report also allows us to take a significant step forward: the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will be able to intervene to prohibit the sale of certain financial products acknowledged as toxic to the economy. In conclusion, I would like to talk about an important point linking the discussion on MiFID I and the text we are going to adopt here. When considering MiFID I, Parliament’s main contribution concerned, the issue of advice that investors, particularly small investors, must be given when undertaking an investment. Financing conditions for such advice remain a point of discussion on which we must provide clarity to ensure that everyone, irrespective of income, may access such advice on terms that are transparent and actually enable them to invest on an informed basis.

Mr President, I hesitate somewhat in giving Mr Eppink the opportunity to speak even more. All the same, I would like to give him the chance to correct what he said with regard to the latest International Monetary Fund observations, because, on reading carefully –
 as you clearly have not –
 what the IMF says about the European situation it is exactly the opposite of what you said. In fact, the IMF tells us that the policies currently being followed will lead to more austerity, something which, moreover, can be seen by any person who is intellectually honest –
 clearly, still not the case with you –
 in certain countries where extremely harsh prescriptions have been applied under the authority of the Commission. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner De Gucht, could you tell Commissioners Rehn and Andor that this Parliament takes the European Semester procedure seriously? To that end, when, on 28 November, the Commission puts on the table the annual growth review, which will serve as our underlying thread for 2013, we would like them to have several messages in mind. Firstly, to take account of the Growth Pact called for by the Heads of State or Government, on 28 and 29 June; next, the lessons from what the International Monetary Fund tells us, namely that a roadmap based only on austerity clearly has no chance of getting the European Union moving again.  Lastly, we think that the purpose of having an annual growth review and a definition of a European vision worked out before the European Council is to gain the means not simply to condemn each Member State in relation to its budgetary policy but also to draw up a common roadmap, enabling us, for instance, to correct macroeconomic imbalances. Please tell your colleagues that we would like two important things. The first is the possibility for Parliament to be involved in defining this European roadmap. For that we need a document we are able to amend, even though, formally, we do not currently have powers of codecision. Then, if the Member States are required, alongside national reform programmes and stability and convergence programmes, to submit national programmes for jobs, these documents must then be taken seriously. Member States that do not take them seriously must be penalised or, at least, called on to do so with a vigilance not shown by Mr Rehn this year.

Mr President, clearly, Mr Eppink thinks it necessary to play tit for tat and I would willingly tell him that he should know the French situation better and that, clearly, the rules that apply here do not necessarily do so elsewhere. In particular, the country from which I come and which you undoubtedly do not know as well as I do, is one where the demographic situation is nothing like that seen in other European countries, which makes it possible, in a difficult climate in which the President of the French Republic is seeking to re-establish conditions for a fruitful social dialogue to conduct reform, to have a mandate based on a decision imposed in relation to the record of his predecessor.

Mr President, the keystone of the European Union, the dimension that was lauded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, is solidarity. However, there can be no solidarity without money, without a budget. We know today that over the past 14 years the national budgets have increased, on average, more rapidly than the European Union budget, and now the Member States want the EU budget to decrease more rapidly then theirs. Moreover, President Barroso wants the social model to be the spearhead of our competitiveness. The International Monetary Fund tells us that the austerity policy that we are implementing is counterproductive. Day after day, we ask the Member States to carry out structural reforms. The first of these involves investment in human capital. I do not like that expression but it is what it says. Our greatest asset is the quality of our men and women. In that regard, in the next budget, if we do not succeed in building a wall to consolidate social spending, allocating 25 % of cohesion policy funds to the European Social Fund, we will be on the wrong track and we will not be preparing the European Union to cope with the challenges that lie ahead. In the same spirit, we must defend the programme for the most deprived persons and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. Pervenche Berès,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

Mr President, I am going to speak on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the report by Ms Auconie on a proposal to support European Social Entrepreneurship Funds. Last week, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, in an excellent conference organised by Commissioner Andor, emphasised that the European social model was an element of EU competitiveness and that social entrepreneurship clearly formed part of this. The proposal we have on the table is therefore welcome. However, I think that we must ensure – and that was the subject matter of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL) – that, through these social entrepreneurship funds, we do not create new niches in financial markets. I have to say that, from this point of view, we have two concerns. We had asked in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that the issue of social housing be treated specifically, and I think that that would have been valuable. Finally, I have to say that the response from the Commissioner representing Commissioner Barnier on the establishment of such funds in tax havens is, in my view, problematic, as, once again, it is not a question of creating new niches or nouveaux riches but of fostering a new, highly promising sector, that of the social market economy, through social entrepreneurship.

Mr President, Mr Hökmark, have you read the Treaty on European Union? It does not talk about a market economy, but about a social market economy. Of all the Union’s values, you only mentioned values and democracy. However, the latter must be enshrined in its social dimension, in social protection, in social dialogue and in collective bargaining, which you clearly seem to be completely ignoring. When you talk about monopolies, are you also thinking about the private monopolies that can bring countries to their knees, such as Goldman Sachs in Greece? When you talk about the internal market, do you have an overall vision of the internal market, a vision of the internal market that we need, that is to say, an internal market that also comprises fiscal and social harmonisation? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, we already had the opportunity to address this issue in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on Monday evening. I would like to make several comments. The first is that, in these country-specific recommendations that you have just made, we basically believe that the fundamental question that should be settled, were all these recommendations to be implemented, is that of macro-economic imbalances within the Union. When you examine this jigsaw of recommendations, you wonder whether we really do have all the tools we need to correct these macro-economic imbalances, whether, in particular, we can make the management of the euro area as a whole as effective as we would like it to be. Then, when I look at the specific recommendations that you have made for France, a country with which I am well acquainted, I am struck by the fact that at no time did you say that these recommendations had been made on the basis of a document submitted to you by a government since defeated in the elections. In this document, you are acting on the results of five years of Presidency by Nicolas Sarkozy. You say that, over five years, France lost 19.4% of its external competitiveness. The French people’s response to that is to say that they would like VAT to be revised, the pension reform to be revised and the minimum wage boosted. However, you say precisely the opposite in the recommendations that you make to this country. That raises an issue of democracy. Mr Hughes has already said this in the name of my group, but I shall say it again in this particular instance. We shall not succeed collectively if, in the Member States, we feel that there is a diktat drawn up in Brussels which ignores the political realities of our countries. You must answer this question. In this Parliament, as you know, we are all in favour of integration, of greater strength together at a European level, because we know that only together shall we be able to recover. However, if you do this against the people, against their political choices, we shall go to the wall. You must answer this question, Commissioner. Pervenche Berès,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the European Parliament wanted to organise this debate based on the employment package that you have placed on the Commission’s table and which we feel it is important to talk about here today, in plenary, at a time when the European Council may well mention a growth initiative, alongside other weighty matters which will be on its work table. With regard to that growth initiative, we think that your voice – which says that this growth must create jobs – should be strong, hence the importance of this debate that we are organising today. When we look at the expectations of Europeans, at the time when the unemployment rate is approaching an historic record, it is not so much stabilising financial markets, but keeping or finding a job that concerns them more than anything. It is this expectation that we must respond to, especially when it comes to the youngest citizens. This hope bumps up against the realities of a social situation that is intensifying by the day. How, indeed, can we fail to foresee the spectre of a lost generation when we know that 5.6 million young people are unemployed, that one young European out of five is looking for work and that the situation may not improve before 2016, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The European Commission repeats that it will take some time before guidelines produce effects in terms of job creation. However, for this to happen, the guidelines must be the right ones. It is striking to see that in the national reform programmes that the Member States have sent to the Commission, ultimately, their commitment to present their national employment plans has not really been followed up with results. Many have not implemented this proposal. I would like to retain two proposals from this employment package that you have put on the table that we think are right at the heart of the discussion that we need to have. Firstly, the taboo that you have ended when it comes to the minimum wage. You said that the minimum wage is an important element in the debate for combating poverty and social exclusion, for combating social dumping, and for putting forward the question of aggregate demand, of stimulating internal demand. It is a major topic if we wish to solve the problems of internal imbalances within the European Union. Next, there is a second proposal that you seem to support, for which you know that Parliament will give you its backing, and that is this idea of a Youth Guarantee, which means that no young person would be without employment, education or training after four months in the labour market. This is a major proposal. If we want to commit to specific proposals that go beyond mere words, we must move forward on this in the coming months in terms of financial perspectives and the conclusions of the next European Council, and we will be by your side to do this. Thank you, Commissioner, for the process into which, together, we will be able to breathe life so that we may correct a strategy which, for too long, has been one of austerity and which is leading us towards disaster. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Ms Vestager, Mr Rehn, with these two reports, I think the important message that Parliament can bring to your work is that we must begin to improve consistency, since we can plainly see that the crisis we are sinking into, or have already sunk into, requires us to be perhaps a little more consistent. We cannot demand a lot from certain Member States and, at the same time, give nothing back, and we cannot wait until the end of the whole affair to reward them for their efforts. It is entirely a matter of governance – modern, intelligent governance adapted to the reality and severity of the crisis facing us. To achieve this consistency, when we draw up our economic policies, we must bear in mind everything we have learnt and everything we know about the extent of the macro-economic imbalances and the need to correct them. That means that the policies introduced must be evaluated, in terms of timing and criteria, according to how well they address these macro-economic imbalances. Secondly, Ms Vestager, the banking union question will clearly be at the heart of the discussions at the European Council on 28 and 29 June. The message I think this Parliament can give there, particularly with Ms Ferreira’s report, is one of balance. There must be a balance between a new approach in the Council debate to the challenges of growth, of which we are one of the main axes in Ms Ferreira’s report – which I hope will be given considerable support by this Chamber – and managing the debt issue. This balance between the way the debt question is addressed and the need for real growth – not merely internal market liberalisation but, above all, growth aiming at the long term and at investment – will at last enable us to give Europeans new hope. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
).  
– (FR)
 Mr President, Ms Vestager, Commissioner, when discussing a proposal on financial regulation, in a very classical way, two arguments are put forward. The first is that it is only possible to act on the largest possible scale, if possible on a global scale, and that any descent to a lower level would lead to a risk of unfair competition. The second argument is to say, ‘Oh, no, but certain products, which are safe, have to be excluded’. I would simply remind our fellow Members of the commitments made by the European Union, in particular through the members participating in the G20, who, in London, in April 2009, said, ‘We have decided that all financial institutions, markets and products of systemic importance should be subject to an appropriate level of regulation and supervision’. It seems to me that the taxation of financial transactions must also, under these conditions, cover undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and pension funds, that the level of intervention at which we will be able to launch this proposal will be the correct level of intervention, and that the issue of risks must be assessed on a global scale and not simply always to protect them. Pervenche Berès,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs wanted to ask this question, and it did not know at the time that, on the very day on which we were to debate it, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) would bring out global youth unemployment figures, with 75 million young people unemployed and a red card for the European Union, within which 7.5 million young people between the ages of 15 and 24 are currently neither in a job nor in education or training. The European Union comes bottom of the class worldwide. Yet, when I look at the challenges facing the European Union, throughout the world, here and elsewhere, all day long, we say that Europe must meet the challenge of innovation, that it is innovation, that it is – a phrase I do not like – our human capital which will enable us to win the battle of globalisation. Yet, if that is the diagnosis we are making, how can we leave outside the labour market and exclude an entire generation? It is the whole question of the social impact of this crisis, which is not taken into account, which is neglected, which is regarded as a secondary issue. We are taking a collective risk, the consequences of which we are already seeing in a number of countries. The European Commission therefore set up eight Action Teams in eight of our Member States – Italy, Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Latvia, Spain, Lithuania and Slovakia – so that the European Union could mobilise its actions and its teams in these countries in order to meet this challenge in particular. Our questions to you, Commissioner, are therefore as follows. What are your conclusions? What proposals are you making? Where do you stand on this? We will support you whenever useful proposals are made to address this issue. However, we cannot accept the fact that youth unemployment rose from 14.7% in 2008 to 22.1% in 2011 and that, in many of our countries – as we know – almost half of young people are outside the labour market. We need what we have defined together as the goals of the EU 2020 strategy, which, it seems to me, has not aged a bit from that point of view, to be followed by actions. Yet, in this strategy – need I remind you – we said that we wanted early school leaving to be reduced to 10% of young people. We said that 40% of 30-34 year-olds would be required to have a qualifying diploma. What is happening in this regard? The proposals are on the table. I have taken note of the conclusions of the Council of 11 May 2012 with regard to strengthening the creative potential and innovation of young people. There is an urgent need for the EU to work towards this end. When the European Parliament, in particular, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, has examined the report by Jutta Steinruck on the EU programme for social change and innovation, it will submit proposals to you to enable us to finance a Youth Guarantee so that young people, when they leave the school system or when they lose their job, are no more than four months without work, without a training proposal or without an apprenticeship proposal. Those are the elements we want to discuss with you, Commissioner. We are convinced that this issue is a challenge for this generation of young people, the objective being to prevent them from becoming the excluded of tomorrow. However, it is also a challenge for our entire society, for the benefit of which we must take action. Commissioner, I know that, in this regard, we can count on your vigilance and the fact that you are a force for bringing forward proposals. This is a good opportunity to debate these elements and to make forward-looking proposals. (Applause) Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since, at this European Council, we ought to be talking openly and putting all our cards on the table, it seems to me that the state of the euro area means we should be thinking about things in three stages: the short term being the urgency of the situation in Greece, the medium term being a strategy for growth and the long term our vision of the euro area and us ‘living together’. In the short term, for Greece, we should realise that all those who thought that Greece could have a smooth exit from the euro area are being totally unrealistic; we have no Great Wall of China to protect us should Greece leave the euro area. Although we should also recognise that, in the Greek situation, nothing will be resolved if we continue to implement the troika’s mandate, which the Greeks rejected today. If we do not think things through, then nothing will be possible; there will be no general framework for an economic recovery, no hope restored, no dialogue and no solidarity at European level, be it in Greece or at European level. Commissioner, as you know, Mr Hollande’s election offers a rare window of opportunity to raise these issues again under new conditions. I do not agree with Mr Ferber when he said that there is only one model in Europe, the German model. We are a union built on diversity. Therefore, grab this window of opportunity that you have been given to finally provide Europe with all the answers it needs. These answers include a growth strategy, but not just any growth strategy. It should look beyond the internal market to avoid the traps of negative integration. These solutions should also include a genuine industrial policy, enabling us to make the investments we need to make our Europe a sustainable Europe, where jobs are created, where the main waste is not this generation currently being squeezed out of the labour market. You must admit then, Commissioner, that the way in which pressure is currently being put on Greece to reorganise its administration, while nothing is being done to help it with its negotiations with Switzerland, to put an end to the tax evasion performed by the privileged few in this country, is a source of injustice that neither the Greeks nor the Europeans, nor the French, nor the British nor the Germans should accept.

 Mr Mitchell, I believe that the notion of showing respect for those who show solidarity is the basis on which we can all live together at European level. I also think that, in the case of your country, significant efforts have been made that have allowed you to recover from the difficult situation in which you found yourselves, but the contributions of a country like Ireland to what is the euro area is an issue which raises many other things that need to be put on the table. I should like to take this opportunity to say a few words about whether or not we should have taken note of the phenomena of rising prices and building bubbles over recent years. I see that, in your country, they managed to create a property bubble without stopping it in time. This is exactly the type of situation that we need to prevent. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I know the rules of this House. However, I would simply like to inform all of my colleagues about the vote that has just taken place. This item was added to the agenda on Monday and, clearly, most of my colleagues in the various groups did not know what they were voting on. That is why I abstained on most of the items in this resolution. I think that we have real difficulty here in terms of our working method. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr Rehn, Commissioner, the fact that you are taking part with us in this debate on employment rights in a Europe of open borders implies, I imagine, that you have something to say on the subject in addition to your role of listening to the speeches. I must tell you, Commissioner, that you and I are very different, because whereas I am a lay person, to hear you speak, I sometimes get the impression that you belong to some sect or church that preaches austerity as its dogma. As a lay person, I rely on evidence. When I look at the current situation in Spain – a country that has conscientiously followed the Stability and Growth Pact and implemented all the Commission’s prescriptions, even when President Zapatero was in power – six million people are unemployed in the country today. Then I ask you, Commissioner: are the employment rights that we are talking about only valid during untroubled times, and in times of crisis must the Troika go to Greece to impose an austerity plan that totally ignores the strength of our social model and the important role of industrial relations in helping us come through the economic crisis? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Commissioner, my point is that at the time, Mr Sarkozy and Ms Merkel wanted to divide the socialists by using Mr Zapatero as an example against other socialist examples. Clearly, this is not the issue. The issue is whether or not healthy public finances can be restored in a country with no growth. The issue is not whether the problem is with the regions or with central government: the issue is growth for job creation. Commissioner, do you think this recipe will succeed in Greece when basically, from the workers’ point of view and that of the Greek people themselves, what you are proposing is for investment plans to be implemented by large German companies, and that Greeks should take advantage of their freedom of movement. That is tantamount to an organised brain drain. Do you really think that is the right way? Do you not think that, at the end of the day, there comes a time when one needs to admit that there has been a mistake? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, you said you were, on balance, in favour of the mutualisation of debt. You must tell us the steps you have taken in this regard and, more importantly, whether you think this mutualisation is useful and necessary or whether you are perhaps reacting to the new proposal made by Eurex which, in reality, destroys the European Union’s internal capital markets, allows speculation against a Member State and further diminishes the prospect of mutualising debt. In addition, Mr Barroso, I would like to know whether you have been informed by the outgoing French Government of the conditions for assessing France’s National Reform Programme and its Stability and Convergence Programme this year, given this country’s electoral timetable. Finally, with regard to the decisions taken this morning by your college relating to what is known as the ‘employment package’, I wonder about the consequences for your neighbour, Mr Rehn, with regard to the austerity policies being put forward in his portfolio. I already know what the response will be: ‘first austerity, then jobs’. I am led to believe this is not the solution and that what we are seeing today in Greece or Spain tells us that another way must be possible, one based on a pact for growth, responsibility and governance. Therefore, Mr Barroso, can you assure us that you are combining your two pillars, your employment pillar and your economic pillar, in the service of European citizens and job creation?

 Mr President, as Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I and Mr De Castro, who chairs the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, wished to raise this topic again here in plenary, partly in the light of the initial declarations made on behalf of the whole College of Commissioners on 15 February, in which it was stated that the Commission intended to use its exclusive right of initiative to bring a proposal back to the negotiating table whereby this programme could be funded under the next financial framework. As you know, you will have Parliament’s full support for such an initiative; however, we are asking you to go further. We feel that this programme must not be held ransom to intergovernmental talks on the common agricultural policy, nor should we subject it too literally to European Court of Justice judgments without reclaiming the legislative initiative. We are therefore calling for this programme to be a genuine solidarity programme; in other words, it should not be a burden on the European Social Fund. Otherwise, as I have already said, we will be using the poor to organise solidarity for the poor. That is not what we need. Lastly Commissioner, I would like to draw your attention to another matter: many people in this Parliament do not support macro-economic conditionality – you will never have our support for that – but do support subject-related conditionality and concentration on specific subjects. One of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy is to combat poverty and social exclusion. This provides all the legitimate basis we need for funding aid to the most deprived out of the EU budget. We ask you to strive for this, and to try to bring on board the Member States that are dismissing this call. Instead of counting them on a list, why not persuade them, and use your exclusive right of initiative as a means of prodding them along? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr Vice-President, may I ask you to deliver a message to our President, to thank him and congratulate him on his action at the European Council? I believe that he had a significant impact on the debates by posing the question that is key for European identity: both that of the European social model and that of the democratic legitimacy of the processes embarked upon. This European Council has seen the signing of a treaty when even a government that is one of the most fervent advocates of a ‘Merkozy’ strategy now finds itself in difficulty. In my view, neither Spain nor the Netherlands could reasonably apply this treaty. I have understood, though, that in parallel, suddenly, our leaders have apparently discovered that they must also talk of growth, but not in the same way, not with the same golden rules, but with soft rules. I must say to you that there will be no more growth if you only apply the rule of the internal market, which is just a rule of negative integration, whereas your conclusions turn their back on the balance that had been enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy. You are unravelling this strategy and rewriting it after less than two years. The destruction of the European social model will not bring about more growth. There will not be more growth while those who claim they want to protect it are undermining the foundations of European identity. There will be more growth if you think, first and foremost, about jobs, joint industrial strategies, a European energy community and specific combating of tax evasion, instead of waiting countless months before negotiating and denouncing the unilateral strategies of some Member States. There will be no growth without consistent commitments by the Member States when we negotiate the financial framework and the introduction of an own resource on the basis of Eurobonds and a tax on financial transactions.

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, I address this question to you because Parliament does not understand what is happening at the Council. In December, we adopted by a very large majority the Commission’s proposal to extend European Globalisation Adjustment Fund crisis measures. Now we see it has been completely blocked at the Council in an inconsistent move that we do not understand – for can we declare the crisis over? Can we really say that this fund has not been a useful reflection of the effects of this crisis on workers? Today, growth forecasts for European GDP are between 0.5% and 3%. Or is Mr Draghi mistaken when he cites these figures for future European growth? The Commission itself predicted an economic downturn of 0.3% across the European Union in its latest projections published in February, despite the fact that in November 2011, it was still expecting 0.5% growth in 2012. Where will the crisis end? The crisis facing those employed in industry threatens the very existence of European sentiment. It encourages scepticism towards the European Union. It causes us to turn our backs on the very essence of our peaceful coexistence and ignores the elements of social justice we could provide. Applications submitted under crisis-related criteria have only increased since this crisis has not gone away. I must tell you Mr President that within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we have had the opportunity to hear from Spanish and Lithuanian experts who told us how valuable this crisis mechanism was. Furthermore, I wish to bear witness here to the response of the German public authorities. The director of the European Social Fund group has testified to the exemplary nature of this mechanism in bringing about social innovation and enabling workers affected by this crisis to find a European answer to their problems. However, today, his government constitutes a majority in favour of blocking the extension of this mechanism. We do not understand this and ask you, on behalf of the Presidency of the European Union, to use all your power to break this deadlock. I believe those who consistently argue for more flexicurity. Flexibility certainly exists, with widespread redundancies – day after day, we see jobs disappearing. Provide a little bit of security, allow these workers to be given training, a transitional period as they adapt to the new situation they find themselves in. I am worried that if this is the position of the Council today on the extension of the crisis mechanism, what will happen tomorrow when, as part of the financial perspectives, we are to negotiate the extension of mechanisms to all farmers affected by free trade agreements? There comes a time when the Council must choose between real solidarity and fake solidarity. Today, we prefer evidence and we do not believe the time has come for happy announcements of growth that might one day lead to job creation, or for the abolition of one of the few tools at the European Union’s disposal to provide concrete help, support and solidarity to workers affected not only by globalisation but, above all, by the financial crisis. We are counting on you, Mr President. You must change the majority in the Council, including among those Member States that are today refusing this extension of the derogation, despite being exemplary users of these funds. Pervenche Berès,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Ms Vestager, Commissioner, this is the fifth year running that the Spring European Council is to be held in an atmosphere of crisis. This is the fifth European Council held in an atmosphere of crisis and where, clearly, the logic is that out of austerity will come growth. I think that it is clearly time to take stock and admit that what comes out of austerity is recession and not growth. However, we have come together today to talk of a document that the Commission is adding to the work of the European Council, which goes by the name of the Annual Growth Survey. You must admit that there is something not quite right here and that it is high time to change our approach. First of all, in the name of our institution, the European Parliament, let me just say that we in this House are in total denial of democracy, because what is going on? The Spring European Council is adopting guidelines which are then going to be imposed on the Member States to define their economic policy strategy. On what basis is the Spring European Council going to reach its decisions? The Commission is trying to make its contribution in a direction that does not suit us, and yet it is tabling a Community document entitled Annual Growth Survey. Meanwhile, the Council is going to draw up the Euro Plus Pact on the basis of a scribbled note written by Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy, and then endorsed by the other institutions. In a democracy, the way in which broad economic policy guidelines are drawn up is the foundation of the social pact. That is why we have been fighting for this Parliament to have a say in the matter. We intend to do this on the basis of what the Commission persists in calling an Annual Growth Survey – we are calling for this to become annual guidelines for growth. We are calling on the Commission to face up to reality. Will this Annual Growth Survey enable the potential contradictions between the Stability Pact and the Europe 2020 strategy to be ironed out? Both Mr Gauzès’ and Ms Cornelissen’s reports – I should like to thank our two fellow Members for the spirit of cooperation that has marked our work – invite you to walk on two feet and, if you want to walk on two feet, you may at times have to turn your back on austerity and the Stability Pact. Otherwise, we shall never manage to implement the Europe 2020 strategy. We are also calling for a balanced approach to economic situations. That means that, when there are imbalances within the European Union, you have to look at both deficits and surpluses. Ms Vestager, as I have already said, for us, the Euro Plus Pact is not a basis for negotiation. Madam, just look at the figures. Today, everybody in Europe is in difficulties. Have you seen the OECD’s figures for Germany’s growth prospects for 2012? 0.4%. That is proof enough that even the most virtuous economy in the European Union cannot withstand the situation of recession into which the policies of this five-year term are leading the euro area and the European Union as a whole. Furthermore, look at the way that you are managing the EU’s tools. The European Social Fund is being used for anything and everything. On the one hand, you would like it to be a tool to apply macro-economic sanctions and, on the other, when it comes to creating jobs for young people, you want to mobilise the European Social Fund. These contradictions must be resolved and, to do this, I suggest you look at the reports that this Assembly is offering you as the European Parliament’s contribution to the work of the Spring Council. I hope that, via our President when he comes to talk to you, these guidelines, whether in economic or employment matters, will improve your road map because, if they do not, democracy and the European people will find themselves in a jam. Pervenche Berès,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, you said that the European Parliament had agreed not to change the guidelines. So be it. However, we would like to see these guidelines implemented and, in our reports, we make a certain number of proposals to provide you with the means to monitor this implementation. In particular, I should like to mention one proposal, the proposal to work with the Member States on a budgetary heading which would allow us to ascertain the contribution of the Member States, for example, to realising the objectives of the 2020 strategy rather than towards military expenditure or whatever else. Ms Vestager, thank you for being here today. You have said that you will report on this debate and the work of this Parliament at the 21 February meeting of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN). This is precisely what we would like to see. It is in that spirit that we would like to advance European democracy and it is also in that spirit that on 27 and 28 February, we shall meet with representatives of all the national parliaments to ensure that, in this European Semester, there is also room for the democratic dimension to thrive. Finally, Ms Vestager, may I call on you to take into account in the same way, during this ECOFIN Council, the new impact assessment that the Commission is due to publish tomorrow on the assessment of the tax on financial transactions.

Mr President, we are going to vote on Mr Siekierski’s report. On behalf of all our fellow Members and, in particular, the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we would like to say that we are going to accept the two-year extension of the Food Distribution Programme for the Most Deprived Persons, on the basis of the agreement reached at the Council. Simply speaking, bearing in mind the political conditions under which this agreement was reached at the Council, we would like to obtain a statement from the Commission on its vision for the future of this programme. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, we must not forget, all the same, that this proposal goes against the adoption of a so-called ‘golden’ rule. This is good because this new treaty does not include a single provision in favour of growth and employment while, on the other hand, you have this declaration, which you have today been charged with putting in place. When you are looking for good ideas to encourage youth employment, I would invite you to turn your attention to Parliament’s work, since we have drafted a report on youth employment in which I think you will find some good proposals. As for the use of the Structural Funds, we are still being bombarded with contradictions which are sparking debate. On the one hand, we want to mobilise Structural Funds to offset the golden rule but, aside from that, we want to use them to sanction the Member States. The time will come when we will have to choose where our consistency lies. How can the European Union work when it is being pulled in two directions? Then, when we are discussing fundamental financial perspectives, President Barroso’s movement questions us. Does the European Union’s budget not need to have resources at its disposal that can be used, depending on the situation, to implement countercyclical measures? In this case, are the proposals you have made for the future Structural Funds programmes adapted to the crisis situation the EU is currently experiencing? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

Blue-card question.

 Madam President, I would like to ask Mr Fernandes if he regards being concerned about the consequences of pension reform which excludes workers from the entire compensation and income system as getting involved in politics – clearly, coming from his mouth, this seems to be a bad thing. Mr Gauzès, who, to my knowledge, belongs to the same group, took the view that it had to be taken into account and that the government as shareholder should perhaps be concerned about this situation. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, the European Parliament, with a very large majority, pronounced itself in favour of extending the crisis mechanism within the framework of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). It is something of a paradox that some Member States – whose representative and member of the Council is not present to hear this debate and our arguments – refuse to extend the derogation within the framework of the crisis mechanism at a time when the OECD notes that the European Union and, in particular, the euro area is in recession, and has corrected the growth forecasts for next year to 0.2%. Where is the end of the crisis? I put the question to the Council. The reality is that there is a blocking minority in the Council which thinks that, since we are in a crisis, it is no longer necessary to apply the fundamental rule of the European Union, which is that of solidarity. I call on the Council to hear Parliament’s message. We demand solidarity within the European Union. Madam President, I would like just one second to talk about Renault. There are some in this Chamber who say that this is all about electoral manoeuvring. I call on the Commission to assume its responsibilities and to ensure that its right hand knows what its left hand is doing. I ask that, tomorrow, when it looks at how pension reform has been implemented in France, it takes into account the damage caused by Mr Bertrand and his pension reform and that it tells France that the disastrous effects of this pension reform must be corrected. Pervenche Berès,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, in tackling this report, Parliament is tackling the issue of democratic legitimacy in the context of economic policy. At a time when everyone is wondering about how economic policy will be handled and about the fate that the forthcoming Council meeting has in store for that policy for the member countries of the euro area, it is important for the European Parliament to express its opinion in order to establish what the democratic legitimacy of the debate on an economic policy coordinated at EU level might consist of. The European Commission has put forward the idea of a European semester in order to give direction to this debate before it takes place in the national parliaments. We believe that, as part of this European semester, we, the European Parliament, must be able to have our say with regard to the Annual Growth Survey that the European Commission is tabling as a key document for this debate. We believe that this document should be an economic policy-making document, which is why we are proposing that, in future, the Commission describe this document as what it is: not an annual growth survey, but an economic policy-making document aimed at sustainable growth. Because, otherwise, it is clear that economic policy coordination at Heads of State or Government level will go in an altogether different direction, that of a Euro Plus Pact, for example, or of who knows what other procedure they might invent in the future. No, we need a document from the Commission that gives direction to this debate, that incorporates the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and, of course, those of the Stability and Growth Pact. To ensure this, we also call for the European Parliament to be able to intervene straight away with quasi-codecision powers before the Spring European Council, and for the President of this institution, when he represents us at that Council, to be able to defend changes to this strategy, to this economic policy stance, on the basis of the mandate we shall give him. We also call for these powers to be recognised explicitly ascodecision powers in the future. Throughout this process, we believe that our cooperation with the national parliaments really must help to create this democratic legitimacy. This means that in February, before the Spring European Council, we must organise this meeting with the national parliaments in order to discuss what this economic policy stance will consist of. We must do so on the basis of what has already taken place and what is set to take place within this Parliament not only on the initiative of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, but also in cooperation with other committees, such as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. Then, once the European Council is over, we must organise a further debate, perhaps on a smaller scale, when the national parliaments themselves will have to ratify their national reform programmes. Lastly, we believe that this Parliament will clearly have to adapt to this new situation if it wants to be involved in this debate to establish the democratic legitimacy of the entire process. To ensure this, we know that we will have to adapt our ways of working, our practices to what is currently being implemented by both the Council and the Commission, and we state in this report that we are ready to do so. Lastly, with regard to the still uncertain prospect of a possible Treaty reform, we would make the following strong point: under the Treaty of Lisbon, this Parliament has rights that make it a key player in any Treaty reform process. We have already been consulted once on the reform of the Treaty when the European Stability Mechanism was implemented, and at that time we authorised this reform without an agreement. Given the issues that could potentially be discussed, we confirm today that we shall not allow such a reform to take place without an agreement. Discussions will have to be held with Parliament on both the time frame and the content of such a reform. It cannot simply be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union, so that economic policy is turned into a form of competition policy. We want this mandate to be a mandate for laying the foundations of EU economic policy, a solidarity and growth policy that is based on democratic legitimacy. As for the issue of how to achieve this, we also call for this Parliament to be involved, alongside the national parliaments, by means of an agreement. Democratic legitimacy is what gives the European Union added value. Pervenche Berès,  
rapporteur. 
− (FR)
 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should first like to respond to Ms Ford, who has abandoned us. It is surprising to see an MEP from the United Kingdom express concern about the fact that a parliament is worried about democratic legitimacy. That does not match the impression I have of democracy as seen from the United Kingdom. I also wish to say to her that we are so insistent that the European Parliament should have the power of codecision when defining its economic policy guidelines precisely because we believe that, budgetary consolidation aside, this is one of the ways of ensuring that our concerns with regard to growth and with regard to funding for innovation, research and investment needs in industry are taken into account. President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to thank you for your insistence on the Community method, and to say to you that, while the Member States are, of course, sovereign powers, it is important that we also learn the lessons of this crisis. One of the lessons of this crisis is that ex-ante coordination of Member States’ economic policies has not worked well enough. To ensure that it does work well, and on an acceptable, democratic basis, in accordance with what the European institution stands for, I invite you, and your successors, on behalf of the Danish Presidency, to take full account of the observations that this Parliament will make on the 2012 Annual Growth Survey. Commissioner, you said that you did not want this exercise to be described as technocratic. It is up to us alone to make it a political economic-policy making exercise. I believe that this report contributes to this aim and I hope, Commissioner, that you will support us in improving the procedure and in ensuring that the Council genuinely takes account of the observations that this European Parliament will make. We shall come to the February part-session with observations on the content so that, together, we are more effective. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Vice-President Rehn, I think that you heard Mr Juncker when he talked about how the European semester should become a political tool. To that end, the founding act of the discussion – which is at least what we think you called the Annual Growth Survey – must become annual guidelines for sustainable growth. You have the chance, this time, to change it before next time, so do it. If this European semester is to be a debate about political guidelines, there will then be no economic government without Parliament involved, having its say, creating discussion around these political and economic guidelines. You must realise that, in 2012, this European Parliament might propose amendments to this Annual Growth Review, which would be debated at the European Council. That is what this Parliament is proposing. I hope that you can take it into account, because then you will be keeping democracy and political debate alive and national parliaments and the European Parliament will be involved in what must be genuine governance of the euro area and of the Union. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Daerden, for his excellent work. Commissioner, you fought and managed to get the objective of combating poverty included in the Europe 2020 strategy. Our current fear is that, with austerity plans, this essential objective may be overlooked. The conclusion of the agreement on the European food aid programme has left a nasty taste in my mouth as I fear that France and Germany have signed up to abandoning it definitively after 2014. That is not the thrust of the Europe 2020 strategy. We have a sovereign debt crisis and yet nothing should make us deviate from this strategy, as it is our road map, the one that we set for ourselves. In the fight against poverty, we must, in the platform that you have introduced, work on more precise indicators, as we still lack the ability to intervene in a targeted fashion with quantified objectives. This would allow us to benefit from intervention from the European Social Fund, in particular, targeted precisely at real trends in poverty. Then we would like the issue of minimum income to be raised clearly. We are calling for a consultation by the European Commission on a legal proposal of this nature. That, Commissioner, is your responsibility. We are also calling for the issue of accessibility to social services of general interest to be maintained. Finally, we are calling for the horizontal Anti-discrimination Directive to see the light of day. This is also crucial if this platform for combating poverty and social exclusion is to be a success. Pervenche Berès,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, we welcome the fact that the Commission’s draft budget has been restored in the areas that concern the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. The Commissioner was good enough to welcome this, and we feel this is important overall. This is the first budget since 14 January 2011, and hence the first since the Arab democratic revolution began. We welcome and back the European Training Foundation’s initiative to secure EU budget funding to help support industrial relations and the development of the labour market, in the context of the dialogue we will be entering into with these southern Mediterranean partner countries. Unfortunately, this is not the first budget of this economic crisis we are going through. We therefore feel that all initiatives that can be undertaken to support youth employment, especially through the pilot project we have begun, and the ‘Your first EURES job’ project for young people, are absolutely vital; and we hope that when the budget conciliation takes place, the budget for this project will be kept at the figure we voted for. Pervenche Berès,

 Madam President, Mr Dominik, Commissioner, Parliament’s intention in tabling this oral question was to contribute to a debate that we feel is absolutely crucial. When the Commission took the initiative to present this European Semester proposal, the idea was that economic governance should include a period of time for establishing European guidelines. This is, to some extent, a step towards the creation of this infamous economic government. We, the European Parliament, are worried about the fact that there might be an economic government without an economic ‘parliament’. We would like to hear your assessment of the democratic legitimacy of this European Semester. How does democratic debate on this European Semester fit in? Political debate on economic policy guidelines is the foundation of every democracy. If you raise the level at which economic policy guidelines are decided, then you must pay heed to the democratic debate and deliberation on those guidelines. That is what the European Parliament is trying to ensure and what we are challenging you on. I note that, during the European Council on Sunday, you brought up the European Semester and you managed to do so without once mentioning the European Parliament, or even, I have to say, the national parliaments. Do you think that that is acceptable? Similarly, the Commission pledged to present its next Annual Growth Survey in December. Very well. So be it. Why, then, have you not discussed it with us? Where is the democratic debate on this issue? When you table your new proposal, which assessment of the cycle that has just ended will you base it on? How are you incorporating the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives in your analysis of this European Semester? Furthermore, as Ms Bowles said – and I fully support her on this and on many other points in this matter – we are asking you to be completely transparent with regard to the amendments that you make to the country-specific recommendations after discussing them with the Member States. Otherwise, this exercise has no legitimacy and is meaningless. When you adopt the Annual Growth Survey, how much importance do you really attach to that document? Is it just a bureaucratic document to keep the European Parliament happy, or is it a genuine policy document? Unless we are mistaken, and your real objective is the Euro Plus Pact. We want some explanations on this point, Commissioner. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 – (FR)
 Madam President, Commissioner, with this report – and I should like to congratulate our rapporteur, Ms Bastos – we wanted to initiate dialogue with the European Commission. Your colleague, Ms Damanaki, reiterated on your behalf the proposals that you are making regarding the use of the European Social Fund (ESF), to ensure that 25% is dedicated to training and to the use of the ESF in every project. However, we are concerned about the idea that, at this time of crisis, which we have been debating all day long, we might penalise countries that are finding it difficult to meet the Stability and Growth Pact criteria by reducing the structural funds, particularly the European Social Fund. Europe will not have the means to rise to the challenge it faces, namely, overcoming the crisis and implementing the Europe 2020 strategy – for which the objectives of job creation and combating social exclusion are absolutely paramount – in this way. If we wish to successfully rise to this challenge, the issue of training, as Ms Bastos has suggested to us, is vital. That being the case, we also need to ensure that the creation of new types of jobs does not make us lose sight of one of the pillars of European democracy, namely, the functioning of social dialogue. We do not believe that it is necessary to depart from this idea of collective agreements, which have ensured the success of social democracy in Europe. Moreover, through your colleague, Commissioner, you also pointed out that the European Job Mobility Portal, EURES, is a precious asset when it comes to the free movement of persons throughout Europe. I believe that together, we need to take a fresh look at this matter so as to ensure the effective operation of this tool. I have heard it said, here and there, that we might be able to improve its functioning, and I would like it if we could work towards this together with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 – (FR)
 Madam President, Commissioner, like many who have spoken before me, I think that Ms Rühle’s report is a good one. Public procurement is an instrument with which public authorities can set an example. Consequently, this idea that the criterion of the most economically advantageous offer should replace that of the lowest price is somewhat in line with our demand at European level for the criterion of GNP no longer to be the only indicator. We are on the right track. However, if you are looking for ways of going further, you could also take the step of proposing bonuses and penalties for companies that fail to meet the requirements in terms of sustainable and quality goods and services when implementing these public procurement contracts. Furthermore, as you and many others have said, we want to be able to facilitate access for operators in the social economy through this review of public procurement rules at EU level. I should like to raise a third point, which I believe is absolutely crucial, namely, the issue of subcontracting. As you know, Commissioner, large worksites throughout the world are a real disgrace in terms of their compliance with social legislation. We cannot bury our heads in the sand and use competition or the risk of the Chinese winning contracts as an excuse. We need to make these contracts an example of excellence in social terms. This means that you have to review the chain of responsibility issue. Tenderers who win public contracts must shoulder their responsibilities, and that includes going and supervising letterbox companies that encourage modern-day slavery and which we cannot tolerate within the European Union. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, you are going to make new proposals on economic governance in competition with, or head-to-head with, the President of the European Council. At least this contribution has added value, though. Economic governance will not improve without democratic oversight, without democratic legitimacy. Do not forget that, at EU level, what goes on in the Council must be overseen by this House and that the ordinary legislative procedure ought perhaps to be considered within the scope of the European Semester. Moving on, I should like, if I may, to put some questions to you as the representative of your President, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso. Mr Barroso came here to deliver a speech to us on the State of the Union, which he hailed as probably one of his greatest speeches. Then, three days later, having denounced the role of the G20, he accepted instructions from a capital to apply macro-economic conditionality to the Structural Funds. Put simply, the regions, the poor and workers are being made to pay for what the capitals have been unable to implement. Do you consider that to be an example of good European governance? On 21 July, when you and the Heads of State or Government adopted the second bailout plan for Greece, you said that we needed a pillar to support economic activity, and you used the Structural Funds for that purpose. Why is it, then, that what was legitimate on 21 July has become an absurdity in your proposal on the Structural Funds? That is not good governance.  (Applause) Stéphane Le Foll  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, we have all gathered this morning to express our anger. There may be legal reasons for the decision that has been taken, but it makes no political sense. Indeed, it is politically indefensible, in the current crisis and under the current conditions, to reduce the food aid budget as you are proposing to do – aid that goes to our most deprived citizens. You cannot leave it there. You cannot. All the political groups in Parliament are calling on you to make the right decisions. We are not talking about EUR 500 million as opposed to EUR 100 million. We are talking about at least maintaining existing levels of food aid. Demand is growing in every country. Let me say a few words on the subject of agriculture. Once again, my comments are directed at the Commission. The question of agricultural stocks is not the same as it was 10, 15 or 20 years ago, when intervention stocks left us with huge surpluses. In the current European situation, we need a policy on food security stocks, both for Europe and for the rest of the world. I say this in the light of starvation levels around the world and the current situation in Europe. These are two very clear signals. You must reinstate a decent budget that will allow us to address this problem. In terms of agricultural policy, the Commission now needs to put forward clear proposals that will allow the creation of what we are calling food security stocks. The reality is that access to food is a major problem at the dawn of the 21st century, both in Europe and in the rest of the world. This morning, this House is sending you a very clear message. I hope that you are up to this massive challenge. Stéphane Le Foll,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Dess, Mr Dantin was cut off, but he was going to explain that the global food challenge is important, and it is important. As has already been said, this report, together with previous reports and the Commission’s communication, seeks to demonstrate that Europe’s aim is to have a common agricultural policy that guarantees food security in Europe and contributes to global food security. That entails political commitments on market regulation, which is what is under discussion today. We too will have to push for this in our debates at EU level. At a time when there are plans to eliminate Europe’s food security programme, we need to remember that food security is still a matter of solidarity and is still extremely topical in Europe: almost 30 million Europeans are currently suffering from malnutrition. Let us not lose sight of that fact. Essentially, this report sets out the broad thrust: the greening of agricultural policy. Of course farming needs to take a positive approach to environmental issues. In particular, it needs to focus on the European element and ensure that it is factored in by incorporating environmental issues into the first pillar. Another important point is that this compromise is the result of lengthy negotiations, in which I have always been involved, on the question of graduated support. At long last, support will be allocated in accordance with two criteria: employment – I believe that agricultural policy needs to allow for the notion of providing employment – and, of course, the production of public goods. This approach is better than continuing the debate on aid ceilings and never coming up with any solutions. I am making the point this afternoon because it is my honest opinion. Let me conclude by saying that this report and Parliament’s commitment are pointless unless the agriculture budget remains at its current level. That is my response to the comments made by the Commissioner and the President of the Commission on the second pillar. We cannot accept a budget cut. Stéphane Le Foll,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I fully agree with the remark that Mairead McGuinness has just made on the fact that there is a fundamental link between the issues of food and agriculture. The issue we are addressing is rising food prices and the consequences that may have for a certain number of populations around the globe, as well as in Europe. I would first like to make the following observation. The trend towards ever higher agricultural and commodities prices is, in my view, a long-term trend, which will continue for three main reasons: first, world demographic trends and a rising world population; second, the fact that, with global warming, we are experiencing problematic weather hazards such as drought and floods; third, because the world is also developing. With new emerging economies consumption levels are increasing. Therefore, the tight situation on agricultural markets and agricultural commodities is a trend that is on the increase. It is aggravated by price volatility, and price volatility is a consequence of the financialisation of the global economy. This is what we should be addressing if we want to resolve the agricultural issue and the food issue. To do this – what the Commissioner said is important – there are two elements: yes, there needs to be transparency on stocks, but we also need a public policy on stocks in Europe and stock management at a global level, especially at the level of the United Nations. Secondly, regulation of the financial markets and market speculation is essential, in particular by ensuring that there is no longer any connection between the speculative volume and the physical quantities exchanged on the markets. As regards food, it is unacceptable that speculators speculate without taking account of the consequences this may have for world food and humanity. This leads me to draw two major conclusions. Firstly, we need a strong European policy and to strategically reassert Europe’s commitment to being a global player in the food and agricultural sectors. Secondly, we need to change our development policy to ensure that globally – and Europe is a global player – we once again invest in agriculture, because we need agriculture to feed the world. (Applause) Stéphane Le Foll,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, I should like to speak without going back over the debate we have had up to now. We debated a 2011 budget under the constraints with which we are familiar, that is, those of a deep crisis affecting all of Europe with public deficits at national level which could lead to two hypotheses. Either these public deficits at national level pose a constraint on the European deficit, or these deficits at national level must give a new direction and a new lease of life at the level of Europe. That is the question. I am asking you, Commissioner, to try, above all, when we debate the budgetary review, when we are about to start to talk about the budgetary perspectives for post-2013, not to remain completely absorbed by this context of crisis, unless you are going to tell me and tell all European citizens that, in effect, Europe will remain in the crisis for a long time. Our entire problem really concerns how to manage the crisis and reduce our deficits and debt, and also how to prepare for extricating ourselves from the crisis. That is where the question of the budget comes in. We can only get out of the crisis, and Joseph Daul made this point just now, if the European budget, on account of being European, is able to provide us with the resources to recover what we are lacking today; that is growth, job creation, innovation, research. That is what is at stake and it is in these terms that we should debate the budget and not do what we are too often prone to do, that is, constantly harp on about the issue of the crisis and the issue of deficits, and the Council really excels at that. I observed that at Deauville, the German Chancellor and the French President even announced in anticipation a reform of the treaties, without having had any kind of discussion with Mr Van Rompuy, so as to punish all those States which failed to respect budgetary discipline in the future. That is where we have got to in the Council today, while Parliament is only asking for one thing, in particular of the Commission, and that is to try to move the European project forward, which happens through the budget. So, you have noted a certain number of issues on which we are entirely in agreement. There is a need for greater flexibility. Evidently, we must manage together to find the capacity to have a much more flexible budget because it is a necessity; Europe’s capacity for reaction is at stake. It is also, of course, a question of setting priorities and organising the European budget efficiently. We are all doubtless in agreement that it is a necessity. However, where we must be clear with one another is on the need for a timetable, on the need for us to set our objectives together. Commissioner, we cannot leave matters as empty words and promises, written texts which are extremely interesting and with which I agree almost 100%. Now we are going to have to get down to the practical matters and, in particular, to an essential issue that we have been skirting round, that of own resources. What do we need to do in order to have own resources tomorrow for Europe, or rather for all the citizens of Europe, so that we are all put back on the path to growth and on an even firmer path for the Europe of tomorrow to take? We await your ambitious proposals, Commissioner. Stéphane Le Foll  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I too would like to welcome the work done by the rapporteur, Mr Bové, to welcome the Commissioner, and also to welcome the speech by Mr Dess, who spoke before me, on the objectives of this report. I feel it is very important to remember that, in this debate, we have to solve a problem linked to the volatility of agricultural prices and, above all, to the fact that, when prices rise, the increase is very quickly passed on to the distribution sector, but when they fall at production level, there is no knock-on effect for consumers. Therefore, there is clearly a problem with the way in which the chain is organised; there is clearly a problem with the way in which so-called added value is distributed within it. I believe that Mr Bové’s report offers ideas, in several areas, that we must take further – and here I am really addressing the Commission – in order to try and emerge from this fundamentally negative spiral. The first, of course, is to organise the chain and the balance of power within it. What proposals are we making to ensure that producers who work together and are organised carry more weight within the chain in order to negotiate? That is the question you asked, Commissioner, with regard to interprofessions, but it is also a question that relates to the contractual basis that is going to be implemented. I call for this contractual basis to have a European framework – a point made in the report. We cannot let each country solve this problem. There has to be a European framework. It must be flexible, but it must exist. This proposal, this course of action, is inextricably linked as far as I am concerned. Secondly, of course, there is the issue of price transparency. Here, I am in favour of creating this observatory, which we absolutely must have so that consumers can be kept informed of price trends. Those are the points I wished to make. I support the proposals that have been made and I hope, as Mr Dess said, that the rapporteur’s proposals receive the support of the majority. Stéphane Le Foll  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I understand that you had a short and happy night. I thank the Commissioner for listening throughout this debate and I would like to congratulate Mr Lyon on the work he has carried out in connection with the report he is presenting this morning. What is the aim here? To make people realise that, in today’s world, agriculture, food and the environment are challenges for the whole of Europe. That is the aim. What do we mean by that? Rejecting the renationalisation of the CAP and increasing cofinancing, that is the first point. Maintaining an agricultural budget that is a match for these challenges and this major issue of food security, that is the second point. Ensuring that agriculture can provide the public goods demanded by society, that is the third element. The fourth element is regulating and preventing market volatility, which I believe is essential. We must return to this topic and we need to go a little further still. My final point concerns the first and the second pillar. I warn all those who defend this structure – and they are perhaps right – that, ultimately, within the framework of the budgetary discussion, there is a danger of the first pillar being reduced significantly, with everything being transferred to the second pillar, itself cofinanced, which would contradict the objective we have set of avoiding the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy. I am saying that this morning because this is the debate we are holding. Commissioner, I would like to finish with a simple idea. The CAP was created at the same time as the European Economic Community. We are now in the European Union. I really feel that we ought to have a major policy … (The President cut off the speaker) Stéphane Le Foll,

 Mr President, it therefore falls to us to close these debates this evening, and it is already late. I would like, first of all, to excuse the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr De Castro, who is unable to be here with us this evening for reasons that you know. Like other Members of this House, he has been unable to leave his country to come and participate in our debates in Strasbourg. The issue with which we are concerned results from the general crisis being experienced by the entire agricultural sector. As we know today, we are experiencing a crisis and, above all, seeing a fall in prices and agricultural revenues that is affecting cereal producers, livestock producers, whether pork or beef producers, and also – and I say this on behalf of Mr De Castro – olive oil producers, and which is hitting and has hit dairy producers extremely hard. Faced with this crisis and this price fall, it goes without saying that Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wishes to find out from the Commission what we can do right now and in the future to escape this crisis and, above all, what measures could be adopted in the coming months to support farmers and to ensure that the agricultural markets are less volatile. The first question that I would like to ask the Commissioner is more specifically about the dairy crisis: what is the situation with regard to the measures adopted by Parliament and the Council concerning this dairy crisis and, in particular, to the application of the famous EUR 300 million milk fund that had been agreed? That is the first question because I think that, if we are going to take legislative decisions, then we must know how they are being applied. As I was saying, all types of production are currently being hit by a price fall and a deep crisis in the markets. That brings us to a question and to seek answers on what we might call market regulation and the way in which we can limit this infamous price volatility. Nobody complains when prices are rising, especially not farmers. It is European consumers who fear agricultural price rises, which limit their purchasing power and impact on their ability to buy agricultural products. It is when prices are low and when they are falling for long periods that producers are penalised in terms of their incomes and, above all, and most seriously for European agriculture, in terms of their abilities to invest and to prepare for the future. Agriculture is a hard industry; the investments are substantial and it takes a long time to obtain a return on those investments. We need to stabilise prices. Commissioner, the question from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its Chair, Mr De Castro, is composed of two points. Firstly, you have announced a number of dairy-related measures to be implemented before the end of the year. This is important. Can you give us some details of these? Secondly, there are specific measures that need to be taken on all the markets, not just dairy. Finally, the question that we wished to ask you is how the Commission plans to anticipate and prevent these price falls in the medium term. What market regulation mechanism can be used to limit sudden increases and, above all, sudden price falls? What work is the Commission currently doing and how does it view this issue? Those are the three elements that I wished to mention: the milk fund, perspectives on the dairy crisis and, more generally, the way in which the Commission intends to deal with this issue of price volatility and price falls. Stéphane Le Foll,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, the report I am presenting to Parliament sets out to explain that the agricultural sector has a place and a role to play in the fight against global warming. This week, nature has reminded us – this time in the shape of volcanoes – that it can have a major impact on human activities and on the climate. However, this means that, in spite of everything, human beings and Europe in particular must take responsibility for combating what we refer to as global warming. My report aims to show that the agricultural sector can continue to reduce both its carbon emissions and its fossil fuel consumption and, above all, at the same time, can make a very active contribution to carbon fixation so that, at world level, we can achieve lower carbon emissions and ensure that a greater proportion of carbon is stored and captured. The report attempts to illustrate the need for agriculture to move away from a compartmentalised approach, which consists of introducing a new directive on soil, water, pesticides and so on, whenever there is a problem, towards trying to tackle the agricultural issue in a more comprehensive and systematic way. Within this type of approach, we will need to identify avenues which ensure, as I mentioned earlier, that the agricultural sector not only reduces its energy consumption but, at the same time, actively participates in carbon fixation. This role relates, in particular, to photosynthesis and biomass, and especially to an area that is close to my heart, which is soil and the capacity of European soils to store organic carbon. I believe that this approach, which I discuss in this report and which I hope will be endorsed during the vote that is due to take place in the Brussels part-session, will enable agriculture in Europe to enter a new phase of sustainability and to make the transition to a more environmentally aware state which would place it ahead of a number of other continents and other agricultural systems. In doing so, it would have a more positive impact both economically and environmentally and, as a result, a more positive impact in social terms. This report deals, therefore, with the specific issue of agriculture in relation to the fight against global warming, but it also claims – in any case I hope it does – to explore other ways of sustaining, in particular, the debate that will be taking place on the future of agricultural policy post-2013. I am addressing the Commission; I will be addressing the agricultural committees, as I have frequently done, and I will also be addressing the various ministers when I have the opportunity. I believe we need to change direction. The 2013 CAP needs to be ambitious. It must be based on goals that will help citizens to understand why we need a common agricultural policy. We need a common agricultural policy because Europe’s agricultural community needs both to ensure food security and to embark on the path of sustainability. In any case, this is the direction I propose in my report and the one in which I hope a large majority of Parliament will follow me. Stéphane Le Foll  (S&amp;D

Madam President, President Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, I would like first of all to say that, as far as the 2020 strategy is concerned, everyone agrees on the targets. However, the problem our continent has today is that it is emerging from a serious crisis, the characteristics of that being that we have extremely weak, or even negative, growth globally. This therefore requires political awareness and, for me, that has two goals. Firstly, that of knowing how we organise ourselves politically. In the positions you hold, you have two major responsibilities: to encourage coordination of economic policies – this is absolutely vital – and to set targets with tools to achieve them. This brings me on to the second goal, which I believe is essential, and, at the same time, it will be a question. To achieve goals in public policy, a budget is needed. Today, Europe is confronted with this dilemma: the Member States have significant deficits and the more significant their deficits, the less they will throw in Europe’s common pot. Therefore, we are less able to revive our growth. How do we solve this dilemma? This is the question I put to you. It depends on two elements. Firstly, what are the guidelines that you will defend when discussing the budgetary perspectives with the Member States? Secondly, are you able to move towards innovations that will allow the European Investment Bank and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development alike to assume much greater responsibility and – why not? – to enable Europe to borrow to finance this necessity, which is the growth of tomorrow?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall certainly repeat things which have already been said and welcome, in any case, the result of the Irish vote on the Treaty of Lisbon. I should simply like to draw the attention of the Members remaining in the House to the reasons for the change, because we are satisfied with the ‘yes’ but, a year ago, it was a ‘no’. What has changed? The text? Very little. The context? A lot. That is what matters. We can discuss institutional questions here. What the citizens are waiting for are political answers from Europe. That, to my mind, is the analysis that we need to make of this double vote. There is not just one vote, there are two. The ‘no’ to start with and then the ‘yes’. The Irish said that they needed Europe in the crisis and this needs to be heavily emphasised, because they are asking Europe to protect them and that is important. I shall repeat what numerous members have said. I think that we need to proceed quickly now. So we are turning to the Swedish Presidency of the Council and we are turning to the Commission. If we want to reply to the demand by the people of Ireland, we need to give concrete replies. The economic crisis: is Europe capable of stimulating growth on a European scale? The social crisis: is Europe capable of having an employment policy? For me, these are the subjects at the heart of the debate and I am satisfied with another thing which the Treaty of Lisbon gives us and that is that Parliament will have enhanced powers and, in the political debate, I think that it has an essential role to play and that is to show that there are various options and to debate those options. However, now, if this is to be a democratic debate and if Europe is to manage to provide replies, we quickly need to designate a Commission and to ensure that the Czechs ratify as quickly as possible so that Europe can get back on the road to growth and hope. Stéphane Le Foll  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, I will be brief. I think that there are two parts to this debate. There is the immediate question of how we can extricate ourselves from this crisis. All measures, ranging from assistance for farmers to intervention measures, are necessary – in fact, absolutely necessary. We must endorse them and even call for them to be enlarged in scope. That is what we, together with several fellow Members, are proposing here in Parliament. Secondly, there is the structural question regarding the management of the dairy market, and this is where our views diverge from yours, Commissioner. You propose that we move in the direction of using contractual relations. I can tell you in advance that introducing contractual relations between industrial firms and farmers will, in the long term, result in those industries competing with each other, on a Europe-wide scale. In order to regulate a market, we need public regulation. There is no other solution. After this crisis, that is what the debate must be about. I think that, in this debate, we must respect all opinions and all options; I fear that we acted too quickly at the time of the health check to settle an issue such as quotas, which up until now, as I would like to point out to all those who have spoken, have made it possible to maintain dairy production in Europe, to ensure that the dairy industry is highly developed and, at the same time, to keep prices at a level that was easily affordable for customers.

 The objectives pursued by this regional convention: to replace more than 100 bilateral protocols with a single protocol; to integrate the countries of the Western Balkans into the pan-Euro-Mediterranean system of rules of origin; and to facilitate trade between the member countries, are contributing to the economic integration of the Euro-Mediterranean region, which has been a major objective of the EU’s Euro-Mediterranean policy since the Barcelona Process. In addition, its conclusion has been sought for a number of years by our partners in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean. After all the talk that accompanied the Arab revolutions, it is time to take action. The adoption of this convention will enable the EU to send for the first time a clear message of openness to trade to the countries of the southern Mediterranean, which are finally opening up to democracy. However, the convention alone will not suffice to bring about the major changes we are expecting in the EU’s trade relations with the southern Mediterranean. We therefore need to continue our efforts to support the development of South-South trade, to improve customs cooperation, to modernise the rules of origin themselves and, more generally, to review EU trade policy towards our Mediterranean partners, in that it should take more account of their interests.

 Mr President, on behalf of my four colleagues, I should like firstly to extend my warmest thanks to the MEPs who enabled the adoption of this initiative, and secondly to say that the European Parliament, in my view, is sending a very strong message today to our southern partners and, especially, to their young people, and that Parliament now expects the Commission to make proposals promptly so that the Erasmus and Leonardo programmes actually become a reality for these countries.

I voted in favour of the report by my fellow Member, Mrs Balzani, defining the position of Parliament in the forthcoming negotiations on the 2012 budget. Today, the European Parliament has given instructions to those of its Members who will represent it before the Council and the Commission in the budget negotiations starting on 11 July. If there is a message in this vote, it is that the vast majority of us are intent on warning the Council against any attempt to reduce the European budget. We are not of course advocating spending for spending’s sake. We are well aware of the terrible crisis ravaging our continent. However – and the Socialists have been saying this for a long time – Europe will not emerge from this crisis by sacrificing its future and selling tomorrow’s growth on the cheap. We should, rather, have the courage to speak out and not fear confronting populism. We do not need less Europe. We need more Europe. Until we give the Union the resources it needs to fulfil its ambitions, it would be an illusion to believe that it will be able to return to the path our citizens want to go down.

This resolution, which I had a hand in drawing up, comes at a critical moment, and thus a key moment, in the resolution of the conflict in South Sudan. In January, the South Sudanese overwhelmingly voted for their independence in a referendum. In one month, a new state will be born. However, there are still several concerns, especially after the recent incidences of violence in the disputed Abyei region. More than ever, in this pivotal period, Parliament intends to reaffirm its complete support for the peace process and to appeal to the Sudanese and South Sudanese, as well as the international community, to remain committed to implementing the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement. In particular, the European Parliament is calling on the Sudanese and South Sudanese to propose specific plans taking account of sensitive subjects, namely citizenship, the sharing of debt and of oil revenues. These plans will also have to deal with the difficult issue of borders in order to ensure that a peaceful and viable coexistence of the two states can be maintained. Vincent Peillon  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report by Mr Coelho proposing the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the ‘Schengen area’. This is one of the greatest achievements of the European integration process. The accession of a new State is conditional on strict compliance with the criteria of the Schengen Agreement. In the case of Bulgaria and Romania, the European Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties – like the European Commission – has concluded after evaluation that these two States meet the conditions laid down in full. Consequently, there is no longer any reason why they cannot integrate into this area of free movement. I would find it unacceptable if certain States, under false pretexts and motivated by internal political calculation, continued to oppose it. The Community acquis should not be regarded as an à la carte
 system where Member States can adapt or suspend provisions as circumstances dictate. Therefore, I solemnly call upon the Council to acknowledge the improvements made by Bulgaria and Romania and admit them into the Schengen area. Vincent Peillon  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the Audy report on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme on research and development. With this text, the European Parliament confirms its support for this programme, which is of vital importance for developing European research and improving the competitiveness of our businesses. It defends the establishment of a permanent budget, which is essential if it is going to be able to meet its targets. This report then sets out specific proposals with the aim of resolving the programme’s weaknesses. It rightly highlights the need to simplify funding procedures and optimise existing instruments, so as to facilitate access for small and medium-sized enterprises. Finally, this report reminds us that the European Commission needs to ensure that promoting innovation does not endanger the progress made in basic research. Vincent Peillon  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report presented by Mr Garriga Polledo on behalf of the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013. In a context where populism is on the increase, the effectiveness and even relevance of EU policies are regularly brought into question. Nonetheless, in the face of current crises, whether financial, economic, social or climatic, we do not need less but rather more Europe. This report therefore proposes finally giving the EU the resources to match its ambitions, by arguing for a substantial increase in the EU budget of a minimum of 5% and a mobilisation of the budgetary resources of the Union for the benefit of the EU 2020 strategy. Thanks to action by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the European Parliament also argues in this report for two strong measures: as far as revenue is concerned, an in-depth reform of the own resources system, in particular, through the creation of a tax on financial transactions (Tobin tax); as far as expenditure is concerned, the creation of a category of ‘intermediate regions’ to increase solidarity between the territories of the EU and ensure a fairer distribution of the regional policy’s Structural Funds.

 I voted against the resolution on the lessons to be drawn for nuclear safety in Europe following the nuclear accident in Japan, because I do not believe that the issue of the future of nuclear power – a crucial one for our fellow citizens – can be resolved by this House in a few hours through amendments adopted without any real debate. All the issues must be put on the table, and no options must be ruled out, which is exactly why we need time. At stake are the credibility of our Parliament and the wellbeing of our fellow citizens, who would not understand – and rightly so – if we were to commit them to long-term courses of action that we did not discuss calmly and exhaustively beforehand, taking into account the different national situations and the constraints of our common fight against climate change. Lastly, I should like to say how sorry I am that, due to extremists on all sides, Parliament has been unable to approve at this time an immediate increase in the safety of nuclear power plants, even though we in our group reached a consensus demanding the most serious, transparent and independent checks possible.

I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague and friend, Mrs Guillaume, on procedures for granting and withdrawing asylum in Europe. This text marks a major step forward in establishing a common European asylum system (CEAS) by 2012, thereby putting an end to the intolerable situation whereby, depending on the European country in which an asylum seeker applies for protection, his or her chances of being recognised as a refugee vary between 1% and 65%. Parliament has therefore spoken out in favour of greater justice and greater efficiency in the processing of asylum procedures. It proposes that each country observe the same enhanced rules on protecting rights and modernising procedures: free legal advice from day one, a framework for the time limit for appeals, special assistance for unaccompanied minors, and a faster examination of cases. Also, although I regret that the European right, which has a majority in Parliament, has managed to adopt amendments to the text which cast widespread, exaggerated suspicion on the sincerity of asylum seekers, I warmly welcome the adoption of this report. The ball is now in the court of those Member States that have yet to decide on our proposals. Vincent Peillon  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague and friend, Mr Arif, on the EU’s foreign direct investment (FDI) policy. With this document, Parliament formulates two, in my opinion, major requirements when defining how to frame future international investment protection agreements that are binding on Europe. The first requirement is that all these agreements include clauses compelling European investors to behave responsibly abroad in economic, social and environmental matters. The second requirement is that all these agreements leave scope for the governments of the countries receiving this investment to legislate for the common good. In the past, some private investment protection clauses enabled the adoption, by the third country, of social or environmental legislation to be regarded as indirect expropriation, resulting in compensation. We need to put an end to these abuses. While this Parliament has, for the first time, a say on such matters, the Arif report has fired a warning shot across the bows of the Council and the Commission as they prepare to open negotiations with India, Canada and, soon, with China.

 Mr President, I should like first of all to thank Mr Kalfin for the excellent work we have been able to carry out together and, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for which I was the rapporteur, to thank my colleagues Mrs Hautala, Mr Lambsdorff and Mrs Giannakou. As he has done so himself, I am not going to review the positive points of the report and the proposal defended by Mr Kalfin on the climate change mandate, the increase in human resources, the attention paid to social and development aspects, the environment, human rights, the shift in focus of the guarantee towards countries that need it most, and a stronger link with EU policies. Parliament is united on all these points – let me make that clear – and it must remain so during the difficult negotiations that, as I have just heard, await us with the Council. I would like to draw attention to two shortcomings at this stage. I regret that neither the need to now prepare the EIB for microcredit nor the need to already begin the debate on the post-2013 ceilings has been taken on board, even though the Committee on Foreign Affairs voted for both of these things in the consensus reached by all the political groups. That is why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament decided, with the consent of Mr Kalfin and of the other rapporteurs, to table amendments in plenary on these two subjects. Lastly, there is one crucial point to which I should like, politically speaking, to draw your attention and which has been the subject of debate for years. When the Berlin Wall fell, we were able to react not only with the enlargement project, the practical arrangements of which some may question, but which is undeniably necessary, but before that, we established the EBRD so as to be able to support the necessary economic and democratic transition. The European Union, and also the EIB, as the power behind it, is the largest provider of funds to the other side of the Mediterranean. At the same time, however, we know that the payment of those funds will not continue beyond one programming period – in other words, beyond 2013, as I mentioned just now – and that the discussions that we are having today show that there may be difficulties in the future. There is a project – already adopted by the European Parliament and endorsed in the report on the Union for the Mediterranean – which is referred to in the Kalfin report being debated today, and it is the creation of a Euro-Mediterreanean codevelopment and investment bank. This would be a practical way, beyond rhetorical statements, of acknowledging the European Union’s will to support the major democratic movement taking place on the other side of the Mediterranean, and I hope that this will be seriously addressed and that steps will be taken, in the coming months, to promote the creation of that bank.

Mr President, I should like to start by expressing my warmest thanks to all my colleagues who were involved in this report; this truly is a collective piece of work. We reached 28 compromises; compromises which enriched rather than watered down the strategic vision that we wanted to impart to this report, to our commitment to the Mediterranean. I should therefore like to extend my warmest thanks to Marietta Giannakou for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), Ivo Vajgl for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Hélène Flautre, and the rapporteurs for the opinions of the Committee on International Trade, Mrs De Sarnez, and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Mrs Tzavela. What was important, for us, was to make it understood that there are strategic issues at stake here for Europe. In fact, it is not just a question of thinking that the South needs us; we also need the South, especially in these times of crisis. If we want to have a long-term vision, if we want sustainable growth in a multipolar world, then we also need the South. In light of this, Europe needs to undertake to make the Union for the Mediterranean an area of peace, security and prosperity for its 800 million habitants and to look at this work as a long-term priority. It is this common will that allowed us to come together, because we know that the economic stakes, the demographic stakes, the geopolitical stakes that we are facing, like the social and cultural stakes, presuppose that we are capable of working with the other side of the Mediterranean. For us, it is also cultural and civilisation issues that are at stake. We know this; Parliament has worked in knowledge of the difficulties of setting up the Union for the Mediterranean for two years. We have not avoided tackling the question of conflicts taking place in the South, but we wanted to affirm very forcefully that it was precisely the approach of the Union for the Mediterranean, with specific projects, parity between North and South in decision-making bodies and the possibility, for example, of bringing Israelis and Palestinians to the same table, that was the right method for helping to resolve these conflicts and that, moreover, the Union for the Mediterranean should not be asked to pursue all the objectives at the same time and that it needed to focus on these specific activities. In this project – and I do hope that the second summit of Heads of State or Government will be held in Barcelona on 7 June – we, the European Parliament, wanted to send a strong message to the Heads of State or Government to tell them they must make a commitment because this summit must be a success. In light of this, we have pointed out the approaches that we think are necessary today. First of all, we need to remove certain obstacles, which, of course, include the financial and economic conditions. That is why the European Parliament hopes that the European Union will make a financial commitment commensurate with what is at stake, firstly in terms of what is left of the financial perspective 2007-2013, and that, in the financial perspective 2014-2020, the Union’s undertaking will be much greater, so that the six major projects on the table can be completed. We need to improve the economic and legal environment. We need to improve South-South regional integration. We also need, in addition to economic conditions, new political conditions, which is why we placed an emphasis on cultural integration, education, cultural projects and on the rights of men and women. To conclude: Europe, in this crisis, needs to look far and wide. We must not sacrifice the long term to the short term. We must assume our responsibilities. Europe needs the South. Vincent Peillon,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make three brief comments. Firstly, we have not been lacking in respect for anyone, especially not people who might be victims, but we considered that compassion, moral indignation and insults do not add up to a policy. Secondly, we have not, of course, ignored the conflicts which exist either in Cyprus or in the Sahara or, of course, in the Palestinian territories. Seriously, however, did we think, in the common foreign and security policy or in the various negotiations that have taken place, that it was up to the UfM to deal with these issues? You cannot be everything to everybody and confusion of the mind is not a recipe for efficiency. Thirdly, I too am sorry that the Council is not here. It is not a good sign when you find out that this lack of political will is giving us cause to believe – Dominique Baudis is right – that the summit on 7 June is in the balance. Be that as it may, Parliament will have assumed its responsibilities. The people who constructed Europe did so with a long-term vision and a keen sense – following the fratricidal wars that divided us – of the importance of specific policy. It is this same spirit that we wanted to develop with the Mediterranean in this report. With Europe in the throes of a major crisis, we need to be capable of defining a growth strategy, as I said earlier. We also need to ensure that we do not turn in on ourselves. When you turn in on yourself, when you stop having exchanges with the outside world, then you start to die. That is why I think that this collective piece of work is an important piece of work and I hope that the Heads of State or Government – who have not recently lived up to their historic responsibility – listen and take heed.

Madam President, as our fellow Members have said repeatedly this morning, the problem of financing the developing countries’ fight against global warming may cause the Copenhagen Summit to fail, when we were all hoping it would be a success. As we know, however, these countries are often the main victims of global warming, but they are not responsible for it. The industrialised countries have provided a substantial financial aid package. It is insufficient today, and even the declared amounts are not actually being honoured. This is what obliges us and will oblige us to find new sources of finance. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, following the lead of the Committee on Development, has acknowledged that there is now a need to consider the introduction of a tax on financial transactions of the Tobin tax kind. This 0.01% tax on speculative transactions would bring in USD 100 billion per year; in other words, the amount that it is estimated will be required by 2020 to combat global warming in developing countries. Therefore, Parliament, in following the lead of certain national political leaders, is assuming its responsibilities. I should like to know the position of the Council and the Commission and whether they will support us on this point.Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the strengthening of the rules on the removal of sharks’ fins on board boats. The existing rules permitted exemptions that meant that compliance with the ban on this cruel practice, which involves throwing live sharks back into the sea having removed their fins, could not be guaranteed. While sharks’ fins are the main ingredient in a highly-valued Asian soup, the rest of the meat is less sought-after. There is a great temptation to keep only the valuable part of the shark and to throw the rest of the carcass away, leading to overfishing of an animal of which many species are endangered. However, while the requirement that any fins landed must be attached to the body of the animal should facilitate controls, I remain convinced that the lack of resources allocated to these controls – concerning not only shark finning but also other species – remains the central problem with regard to overfishing, causing harm to the environment and to the overwhelming majority of fishermen, who carry out their work in a responsible and courageous way and face unfair competition that flouts all of the rules.

 I voted in favour of the new certification rules for two-or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles because ultimately they will improve safety for two-wheel users, who are very vulnerable, representing as they do a sixth of deaths on European roads, despite travelling only 2 % of the total distance. Anti-lock braking systems will be mandatory for motorcycles over 125 cc, and the increase in cost should be generally limited by the widespread implementation of this equipment, as has been the case with automobiles. Furthermore, new antipollution standards will be applied gradually between 2016 and 2020. Finally, the entry into force of this regulation in 2016 will signal the end for French motorcyclists of the 100 hp restriction on motorcycles, which has never really proved effective in terms of road safety and could cause insurance cover problems, for example, for a non-restricted vehicle bought abroad.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Monti report’s observation in 2010 was that the rules of the single market were focused primarily on competitiveness and trade in goods, and took no notice of citizens. To put this right, the Commission has presented 50 proposals to relaunch the single market, 12 of them legislative priorities that are currently being examined and are about to be approved. On the 20th anniversary of the single market, which we celebrate this month, the Commission is announcing a new set of proposals for the single market, entitled Act II. These include measures that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has been asking for for a long time, and we are delighted to see them become a reality at last. I refer in particular to the section on social entrepreneurship, cohesion and consumer confidence. I am delighted at the forthcoming improvement of rules on product safety, which is of prime importance for consumers, and at universal access to bank accounts, and the transparency needed on bank account fees. This legislation can demonstrate that Europe protects its citizens, is useful and is not just about austerity policies. The EU has not given up on its social model. We have a duty to maintain this courageous ambition, despite the handicaps. On the other hand, when it comes to Europe being protective and instilling confidence in its citizens, I am slightly more dubious about the proposals on transport and energy networks. I fear that the Commission is still stuck with its ideology of liberalising sectors of the network when we are still a long way from demonstrating the benefits for users, whether in terms of price or quality of services. It seems to me a more pressing issue to respond to the concrete expectations of citizens and consumers with legislation on collective redress, and framework legislation on public services, which we have been asking for for too long. Mr Barroso’s poor communication on public services was clearly not up to the challenge because these services also have a role in the revival of growth in a new industrial strategy. Similarly the Commission is congratulating itself on the potential for mobility that the single market offers citizens. This is to state the obvious, but it would be even better if there were a guarantee that social rights and pension rights would be recognised. The issue of mobility lies at the very heart of the legislation on recognising professional qualifications, on which I am rapporteur. The directive has to and will show that Europe can give real added value to growth, to employment and to its citizens, thanks to smart cooperation between all the institutions and in all the Member States. I am thinking particularly of the major innovation of a European Professional Card. I would like to thank my colleagues for the interest they have shown. We received more than 650 amendments. I know that we will reach some worthwhile compromises, including on sensitive issues like notaries and nurses. All that will remain is for us to persuade the Council to overcome the hesitancy of some Member States, because this is the message we need to give. Yes, the EU can and must be a source of progress and shared wealth to achieve positive, active solidarity between all of its Member States, driven by the same spirit of success from their shared destiny.

This report paints a picture which, regrettably, is hard to deny: we are very far from the goals set in 2004 and 2009. Creation of the Single European Sky is supposed to cut CO2
 emissions by 50 million tonnes and create 328 000 jobs, despite the constraints on growth in the sector as a result of the crisis and increased fuel prices. But, knowing the situation, I am unsure whether it is appropriate to penalise states which do not fulfil their commitments by the cut-off date of December 2012. The introduction of functional airspace blocks is a highly ambitious objective which has implications for national sovereignty and requires the interaction of air traffic control systems that are structured differently and operate differently, so it takes time to ensure a smooth and safe transition. I would be more in favour of incentives, and I think that, before putting forward a new ‘regulatory package’ when this one has not yet been properly implemented, we ought to … wait and conduct some serious assessments.

 The amendments to pharmacovigilance legislation finally introduce the principle of the automatic evaluation of a medicinal product at EU level if the product is withdrawn in a Member State. They also extend the list of drugs subject to additional monitoring. However, the Commission did the very bare minimum after the Mediator scandal. We should remember that its initial proposals on the texts adopted in 2010 were quite simply unacceptable. We had to fight to get rid of measures that were very favourable to the laboratories, making it easier for them to put on the market drugs that had been insufficiently tested with no therapeutic justification in terms of risk and benefit. Unfortunately, these minor changes do not integrate the fundamental measures we had asked for: the financial, hierarchical and intellectual independence of pharmacovigilance activities relating to the industry and medicines agencies, and the implementation of the requirement to demonstrate therapeutic progress in order to obtain a marketing licence. Nonetheless, Ms McAvan’s reports still represent progress in the expectation that a truly ambitious text will be proposed at the earliest possible opportunity. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Single Market Act is to make the market work for citizens again and to bring them and the market together, whilst recognising that an efficient single market can and must give rise to growth and sustainable job creation. Yet, the content of the recent legislative proposals and communications from the Commission show that its concerns are still predominantly focused on the promotion of trade to the detriment of measures aimed at employment and citizens. Some major issues are absent, namely: the promotion of good-quality jobs and rejection of social dumping, safeguarding the social protection model and public services, the portability of social and retirement rights, consumer protection in financial services and the right to collective redress. Parliament must remind the Commission that citizens want and need an innovative Europe that is able to create growth, protect them and also restore their confidence. The resolution that we will adopt tomorrow must send a strong signal in this direction. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, my question is for Commissioner Barnier. Would you mind telling me, please, how much progress the Commission has made with drafting legislation to provide operators in the social and solidarity-based economy with a status? I am referring to mutuals, foundations and cooperatives. These kinds of organisation indeed play a crucial role in cushioning crises and creating jobs and must therefore be protected, supported and encouraged to develop very quickly. Finally, if something concrete is in fact being drafted for the social economy, can we really be content with a simple communication on a quality framework for services of general interest which, in these times of economic and social crisis, also need to be protected by a genuine legal status? Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 – (FR)
 Mr Barnier knows as well as we do, and Parliament and the Commission must work together on this point, just how important this sector is for social cohesion and how much it needs legal certainty in order for social services to be exercised in EU countries. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Mr President, this partnership agreement with Morocco for agriculture and fisheries is an important act concerning a country that has had a shared history with Europe for centuries and is an important trading partner, with which the European Union maintains a net trade surplus. I understand the concerns that have been expressed. Although I have some doubts about certain political hijacking, or exploitation with regard to the rights of the people who are affected but not involved, I also have the same questions about the consequences of the liberalisation on the sectors of activity that are already highly vulnerable. That is why it is essential, Commissioners, to put in place effective compensatory measures to avoid any negative repercussions on European production and jobs. On that condition, I support this agreement because economic expansion in Morocco is an essential lever in consolidating a democratic process that all of us in this House sincerely want to see in that strategic part of the Mediterranean basin.

 Following the example of all the French socialist Members, I abstained on the vote on the Council agreement on the draft intergovernmental treaty adopted by the Heads of State or Government on 30 January. This agreement is not only legally questionable, as it flouts the role of Parliament, but also harmful, because the budgetary restrictions imposed will not resolve the crisis but, on the contrary, can only aggravate the recession. The renegotiation that we are calling for is a logical consequence of that. We must create growth in order to come out of this crisis: this is an economic necessity, and the dogmatic view imposed by Merkozy is not remotely adapted to this. We must restart a virtuous circle by coordinating our economic policies with major joint industrial projects, particularly in the fields of energy and the environment, and by boosting major infrastructure. This can only be achieved through the creation of Eurobonds, which are completely absent from this text, and true regulation of the financial markets, which we have long been calling for. Mr Sarkozy and Ms Merkel’s obsession with strict austerity is becoming dangerous for the whole of Europe. Bernadette Vergnaud,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Pervenche Berès on this outstanding report; it is the culmination of several months of work involving nine parliamentary committees. Thus, in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Catherine Stihler’s opinion emphasised the central role of the single market – the economic pillar of the EU – at the heart of governance focused on the aim of sustainable, inclusive and social growth, in line with the Europe 2020 strategy and in the interests of all our fellow citizens. If we are to take up this challenge, however, we must ensure that the European semester is not just an intergovernmental control system that imposes the diktat of certain Council Members on the national parliaments. Parliamentary consent to the public budget is one of the foundations of democracy. Hence it is imperative that the Annual Growth Surveys be adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure, with the European Parliament and the national parliaments cooperating closely with each other. This is a democratic requirement, and we must stand our ground. Bernadette Vergnaud,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, professional mobility is a key factor for competitiveness and growth in Europe, and is an integral part of the EU 2020 strategy and the Single Market Act. It relates to one of the fundamental rights of the EU: freedom of movement and of establishment. However, it remains limited because we are still lacking simple, clear rules for the recognition of professional qualifications. Repeated tidying-up of legislation does not hide the anachronism of some mechanisms that date back to a time when cross-border mobility was still anecdotal. The fact is that today, 50% of young Europeans are willing to go and work in another Member State, and the new directive will need to take up that challenge. This is a major project. The lack of basic harmonisation of training, the high number of regulated professions and the complexity of the recognition process create legal uncertainty, so much so that this issue accounts for 16% of the complaints made to the SOLVIT network. The main aim is to simplify procedures for citizens, guarantee transparent decision making and reduce delays through better cooperation between competent authorities and between Member States. The classification of economic activities should also be reviewed, because professions and related training requirements are constantly evolving. I welcome the fact that the report focuses on the specificities of the health care professions, due to the implications in terms of patient safety, of course. Finally, I clearly support the creation of a voluntary European professional card system. This type of card should, in particular, facilitate the steps involved and improve consumer and patient safety. Beyond that, this card will help to build a European identity and show that the single market is not only about movement of goods and people, but that it can and should be the basis for economic wealth and shared citizenship. I therefore congratulate Ms McClarkin on this good report, which, I hope, will be widely adopted tomorrow. Bernadette Vergnaud,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, public procurement is a wonderful tool for reviving the European economy, creating quality jobs and choosing more socially and environmentally sustainable offers. To achieve all these things, we have to change our policy of making the lowest price the sole criterion: it is the bedfellow of mediocrity insofar as it obliges public authorities to undertake convoluted procedures in order to choose quality. The report on which we will be voting tomorrow introduces the criterion of the most economically advantageous offer, which enables authorities to demand that tenderers meet high standards. I am grateful to Ms Rühle for having defended this principle so well; it will give operators greater flexibility and greater legal certainty. Another key point is access to public procurement markets, under favourable conditions, by operators in the social economy and small and medium-sized enterprises. European rules are very restrictive for these organisations. They must be improved so that these organisations can respond to major invitations to tender without having to act as subcontractors. In this regard, the very frequent use of this system presents real problems for SMEs affected by tariff dumping and for their employees, who do not benefit from the same pay and social conditions as their counterparts who are employed by large groups. A chain of responsibility must be envisaged. It is unacceptable for main service providers to be allowed to transfer their responsibilities to small subcontractors. I therefore call on you to vote in favour of maintaining paragraph 22, so that employees’ rights are respected and job-creating small businesses are protected in every Member State. Lastly, I am pleased that the Member States have been asked to sign ILO Convention C94 on labour clauses (public contracts). That Convention has been around since 1949, but only 11 Member States are signatories to it. However, I regret that it has not been possible to go further with regard to reciprocal access to public procurement markets in industrialised and emerging third countries. Europe can no longer be the only one to respect the rules, and therefore I ask you to vote against the deletion of paragraph 29. This report is a balanced text, and I call on you not to distort it tomorrow. Doing so would undermine the interests of our industry, our businesses and workers. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

I have declared my support for Mrs Sender’s report as it is not only a major step forward for road safety but also for European citizenship. How can we make motorists understand that they have to obey the rules in their country when they see drivers with foreign plates committing offences with total impunity? It is, above all, an issue of equality before the law. Whilst I can only regret that three Member States have refused to participate, it is a first step towards harmonisation and the objective is clearly road safety, as only serious offences, rather than, for example, parking offences, will result in follow-up cross-border proceedings.

 Following the example of the French Socialist delegation, I voted against the Roth-Behrendt report on EU legislation on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) and on related feed and food controls. It is difficult to understand, 15 years after the start of the mad cow crisis, how we could act as if nothing had happened and how we can envisage putting animal meal intended for ruminants back onto the market, even if subject to strict controls. The current crisis in the livestock sector, linked, in particular, to rising world cereal prices, has to be resolved by regulations at the economic and trade level and by combating speculation, and certainly not by endangering health security.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have been working on this issue for three years now and, in view of the challenges and the huge lobbying efforts of the food industry, I am delighted with the result achieved. I particularly welcome the introduction of mandatory complete nutritional labelling, which will enable consumers to choose healthy products. Allergens will be clearly listed, including for non-prepacked food, and a minimum font size will improve the legibility of information. Mandatory origin labelling for all meat is a real step forward. I hope we will be able to extend it to milk products and to processed fish and meat. It was also essential that alcoholic beverages were not included, Commissioner, because, in my view, they should be subject to specific, specially adapted rules. We could have done better, particularly by introducing legible and harmonised front-of-pack nutritional labelling. However, a major step has been taken toward the civic education of European consumers. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Twenty years after it was introduced, 112 is certainly accessible in all Member States, but only 26% of EU citizens know about it. This is an unacceptable state of affairs, which is why I have fought for Parliament to send out a message to the Commission and to Member States. I therefore welcome the vote on Mrs Rapti’s report calling for improvements to service quality and to the information available about this number. More effective regulation is needed, and it is important that we promote the exchange of best practice and ensure that EU funds are properly allocated. It is essential for automated caller location during emergency calls to be faster, and for the future of 112 to be guaranteed by ensuring the reliability of calls made via Skype. We must also introduce the ‘reverse 112’ automated SMS alert system for use in the event of a disaster. As regards universal service, whilst in the long term the plans are to extend the universal broadband service only, I am delighted in particular with the reminder of service providers’ obligation to abide by EU rules on neutrality on the networks. It is unacceptable that their customers might not be able to access the services, content and applications of their choosing over the Internet. Thank you. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 This vote is important because the Commission has to take the necessary measures to prevent unfair competition and non-reciprocity of access to public contracts in relation to third countries. This is not about erecting protectionist barriers, but the Union can no longer be the only one to play by the rules. Indeed, we can no longer ignore the social and economic dumping practised by companies in emerging countries who are winning contracts in countries of the Union, in defiance of social rights and legislation on State subsidies, while, in the meantime, the markets of these countries are closed to European companies. However we must also not forget that the large industrialised countries, despite signing international agreements, do not play by the rules either! After years of inaction, the Commission seems intent on acting, and that is necessary: the survival of our companies and jobs depends on it. Finally, I welcome the adoption of the amendments put forward by the Group of the Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament with regard to compliance, in the context of public procurement, with working, social and environmental standards in force in the Member States. It is now for the Commission to size up this call. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate all those MEPs who had a hand in drafting these reports. I think that we have managed to produce three balanced texts, which send a strong signal from Parliament to the College of Commissioners about our priorities for a Single Market that operates effectively on behalf of our citizens, for growth and for enterprises. As shadow rapporteurs for Mr Buşoi’s report, we have created a clear road map for the Commission. Firstly, and here we are all in agreement, Commissioner, there is a proposal for a legislative framework for public procurement, public/private partnerships and service concessions which should protect small operators, SMEs and awarding local authorities, and which will guarantee reciprocity between the EU, the industrialised countries and the major developing countries. Then there is the need to ensure that we prioritise the common consolidated corporate tax base and a clear VAT framework. That is crucial if we want our SMEs to flourish within a healthy competitive environment. Finally, we must ensure that innovation is funded, in order to stimulate strong and sustainable growth in major European infrastructure projects, through the creation of Eurobonds. I should like to finish by stressing how important it is, to my mind, that we have reached a satisfactory compromise on the key issues of being able to guarantee social rights in the different legislations of the Single Market and of protecting services of general interest within the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon. Commissioner, we are sending you a very clear message: the economy must be at the service of the citizens, and not the other way round. You need our help. Today, we give you this help, along with a major challenge: that of reconciling our citizens with the European project. So do not let us down and give them the confidence they need!

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mrs Gebhardt, for their work. The Commission’s initial proposal was indeed absurd, as it endangered the level of consumer protection by wanting to harmonise it completely. This is only justifiable so long as harmonisation is upwards and not downwards, as proposed. Therefore I welcome most of the compromises reached, which leave the possibility for Member States to apply stricter rules if they so wish, while guaranteeing a high minimum level for all consumers in the Union. Thus, maximum contract duration is limited to 12 months, information on distance contracts or telesales contracts is improved, with payment being required only when the cooling-off period, set at 14 days, has expired. On the other hand, it is unacceptable to keep full harmonisation regarding chapter V, relating to unfair terms. Not only is the chosen level of protection unsatisfactory, it is also tantamount to ignoring the reality of fraudulent practices, since these require a level of responsiveness that European legislation cannot offer. That being the case, taking away all room for manoeuvre from Member States in this area seems like an irresponsible move. Consequently I hope that the colegislators manage to come up with a balanced text which guarantees a genuine and common core of high-level protection. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 Having been rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament on the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I am delighted with the text that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has adopted, which contains many of the proposals we and other associated committees made. In this respect, I think Edite Estrela’s report is excellent, as it places the emphasis on some of the crucial aspects of our European social and healthcare model: equality of access to high quality healthcare for everyone in Europe, better management of reproductive health, monitoring of the efficacy and quality of drugs through independent pharmacovigilance systems and, above all, the necessity of high levels of public funding for healthcare during this period of economic crisis. Health is not a general good like other goods, and our welfare systems have the duty to ensure that the most disadvantaged have access to healthcare. I am naturally astounded therefore at the votes to remove some of the abovementioned points requested by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group. This step smacks of reactionary neoliberalism, and I hope that the final vote will preserve the spirit of this report and be a credit to this Parliament. Bernadette Vergnaud,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Services Directive was the subject of unprecedented public political debate when it was being discussed in Parliament. Thanks to the efforts to reach a compromise, which were led by Mrs Gebhardt, whom I congratulate, the text that Parliament succeeded in adopting in 2006 was one that reconciled the need to stimulate the internal market in services as a source of potential growth and job creation, and respect for social rights, labour law and the specific nature of services of general interest. In order to maintain this very fragile balance, the directive had to be transposed with the utmost care. This caused problems for many Member States, such as difficulties in implementing the points of single contact and the mutual evaluation process. Right now, I am concerned about and question the choice made by France; it is very much a minority choice and will result in provisions being split up between a whole series of laws and decrees. I also regret the very restrictive interpretation of the concept of authorising the provision of services. It will create legal uncertainty for social services relating to the care of young children and the disabled, even though derogation and exclusion possibilities were provided for in the directive. Parliament is playing, and will continue to play, a full part in monitoring the successful implementation of this directive, which is key to ensuring that the single market creates jobs and is closer to the citizens, and that Europe is experienced on a daily basis as something positive, not something negative. I therefore call on the Member States and the Commission to step up their efforts to guarantee a completely transparent process for European citizens.

Compared to the Commission’s initial proposal, which facilitated patient mobility with a market-oriented perspective on health, I welcome the progress reflected in this agreement. It was essential in order to safeguard our social protection systems that we re-establish a prior authorisation system for hospital or cost-intensive treatment. Similarly, the reference to Article 168 of the Treaty was necessary in order to ensure that the prerogatives of the Member States in terms of organising their public health systems were respected. Finally, commendable progress has been made in terms of cooperation and patient information. There are, however, still major deficiencies: the lack of consideration given to the mobility of professionals, medical demography and the ageing population. Other legislative proposals should remedy this – in particular, the proposal regarding professional qualifications – and in those proposals, it will be important to reaffirm that health is a sector with specific characteristics and not a commodity governed solely by the laws of the market, but rather the most precious asset that citizens have.

 The adoption today in plenary of a budgetary amendment to mobilise the EU Solidarity Fund to the tune of EUR 35.6 million following a proposal by the Commission is good news. This is in response to the request made by the French Government following storm Xynthia, which hit the French coast on 27 and 28 February 2010, leaving 53 people dead and 80 injured in Vendée and Charente-Maritime. The procedure is undoubtedly long and in need of improvement, but I am pleased to see European solidarity being shown in this way, in the face of the tragedy the victims have experienced. I had written to Commissioner Hahn to support the French Government’s request for aid, and he has honoured the commitment he made to me during his visit to La Rochelle in early March. This fund is more than much-needed financial assistance; it symbolises the common values shared by our continent. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by pointing out that I did not believe it right to give our opinion so early on with a vote on the events that took place in Laâyoune on 8 November, when we do not have all the facts at our disposal to give us the necessary hindsight and objectivity. Nevertheless, given these conditions, I am relieved to see that we have reached a relatively balanced and measured joint resolution which takes into account the concept of human rights and which does not unduly condemn either party, even though some points are questionable. In any case, the most important thing I think is not to inflame the situation further so that investigations and negotiations can be conducted in an atmosphere of calm, and so I think it wise not to be drawn into challenging the privileged status of a neighbouring partner country on the basis of partial and often contradictory reports.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a few months after Professor Monti’s report, which called for a necessary recovery of the citizen-oriented internal market, I welcome the Commission’s response. What particularly stands out in my mind is the improved recognition of professional qualifications, aid for SMEs, the new legislation on public contracts and service concessions, and legal certainty for the social economy. I therefore welcome this ambition. However, I regret that, in the 50 proposals, there is no clear definition of priorities. I am worried about the piecemeal strategy of the various Directorates-General and Commissioners and call on Mr Barroso to become more involved in order to avoid contradictory proposals. Finally, I deplore the absence of any real commitment on services of general interest given that, for years, we have been asking for protective legislation, which is now possible under the Treaty of Lisbon. For that reason, Mr Barnier, I am waiting to see the final texts before making my mind up and possibly supporting you in this major challenge for the future of Europe and of all its citizens. Bernadette Vergnaud,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Weiler, on her work and the remarkable compromise achieved with the Council, as the Commission’s initial proposal had some major faults. I would like to go back over four important points achieved in this directive. First, I am very pleased that there is a guarantee in place on equal treatment of the public and private sectors. The Commission was expecting heavier sanctions for the public sector, even though the latter works in the general interest. This was the result of ignorance about the reality of the state of the Member States’ public accounts, and could have resulted in a competitive disadvantage for public companies. Another move forward is the extension of payment terms to 60 instead of 30 days for public health services, which have complex budgetary procedures forcing them to have longer payment terms, for which they cannot be held responsible. Still on the subject of payment terms, it was essential to establish a ban on unfair contractual terms affecting creditors in contracts between companies, which often happens between a large group and a small and medium-sized enterprise. Finally, and this relates primarily to the small and medium-sized enterprises which are victims of payment delays, the introduction of an 8% interest rate in the event of a delay and compensation to cover collection costs could encourage these companies to demand damages. Until now, they have tended to refuse to do so at the risk of this jeopardising anything. I am therefore delighted to be able to vote on this bill which, I hope, will constitute real progress for the viability and good health of European businesses, progress that is needed not only for a more successful internal market, but also a fairer one. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, pharmacovigilance, which involves analysing the side effects of medicinal products and calling for their withdrawal from the market in the event of an alert, incited little interest in the midst of the pharmaceutical package. It is, however, essential to the safety and quality of our health systems and, even though I am delighted to see you, Commissioner, I must deplore Mr Dalli’s absence. I was dismayed by the Commission’s proposals, which jeopardised the pharmacovigilance systems for the benefit of the pharmaceutical companies. Fortunately, thanks to the work of Parliament and the Council, the situation has been improved somewhat. Thus, it will not be possible to generalise advance marketing authorisations for new medicinal products. We can also be pleased with the progress made in terms of transparency. However, I think that this agreement represents a missed opportunity to improve pharmacovigilance and I am concerned, above all, at the lack of guarantees regarding the independence of the system. Thus, even though the role of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee has been strengthened, it is not totally independent of the European committee which grants the marketing authorisation. We know from experience that this committee is loath to go back on its decisions. As for national structures, there is absolutely no provision on the matter. Also, I am sorry that the Member States do not have to report possible conflicts of interest of experts on the European committee. Finally, and this is the most serious point, this agreement endorses the end of the best guarantee of independence: public funding for pharmacovigilance activities, most of which will be funded in future by private fees. I congratulate Mrs McAvan on having improved the Commission’s initial proposal but, as there are a number of problematic issues, I question the point of closing this dossier in a single reading. If we had taken our time, we could have increased patients’ confidence in safe, high quality pharmaceutical products. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

I condemn the ostrich politics of those who think that the European Court of Justice’s current case-law on service concessions is satisfactory and that there is absolutely no need to legislate. For years, the socialists have fought and campaigned to obtain framework directives protecting services of general interest, and there is no question of us abandoning this commitment. The only long-term guarantee for public services is real European legislation, not judicial decisions, however well-founded they may be. As we can see with the difficulties in transposing the Services Directive in relation to social services, only a specific framework can provide legal certainty and quality of service. Small and medium-sized enterprises and local and regional authorities expect clarity and legal certainty in the awarding of public procurement contracts such as social housing public procurement contracts. However, neither did we want to vote against this report, which contains important elements, in particular, as regards social and environmental standards, which we must be able to integrate into tender procedures, recommendations to facilitate SME access, and a clear call for vigilance in public-private partnership contracts. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by expressing my deepest sympathy and solidarity with the victims of the Madeira floods and of storm Xynthia. The necessary questions must be asked about the worrying increase in these destructive meteorological phenomena, and about the role played by climate change and the urgent need to find solutions. For now, it is a case of providing urgent solutions to the populations rocked by these disasters. Of course, public and private insurance providers must be responsive but, when it comes to the destroyed infrastructure and rebuilding the areas concerned, European solidarity must be expressed. That is why the French Government has requested aid from the EU Solidarity Fund, created in 2002, which I hope will be granted quickly and meaningfully. This is the thrust of the two letters that I have sent to the Commission since 1 March in my capacity as an elected representative for the west of France region and which I had the opportunity to discuss, last Thursday, in La Rochelle, with Commissioner Hahn, whom I sincerely thank for being so responsive. Commissioner Hahn agreed that the mechanism was complex and difficult to implement. Well, we have to conclude that it could have been made more flexible if the Council had not incomprehensibly blocked the review of the operation of this fund as adopted by a very large majority of MEPs in May 2006. I therefore hope that the Spanish Presidency will break the deadlock on this text so that the system can be made more effective. In more immediate terms, I call on the Commission to authorise a one­off increase in cofinancing via the ERDF and ESF regional funds for projects in the regions affected, within a time frame that will enable their economies to recover by summer. Lastly, this aid should not be used to rebuild in such a way that the same tragic environmental and town planning mistakes are made; rather, it should be used in a considered way, so as to prevent as far as possible a repeat of such tragedies. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have the opportunity to mention during a priority debate these three reports concerning citizens’ everyday lives. I would like, moreover, to congratulate our rapporteurs on their work and, more specifically, to mention the SOLVIT network. The network has now been in existence for eight years; it has resolved many problems effectively and yet it is completely unknown. How many times have I had to refer people to this network, the existence of which they did not even suspect, even though this tool could strengthen the image of a Europe protective of its citizens’ rights. I must admit – and I am very glad that Mr Barnier is here – that I understand that my country’s government does not really promote it. The increased number of cases would consequently be very tricky to manage for the sole trainee who, currently in 2010, is in charge of the SOLVIT network in France, a country which, it is true, has only 60 million inhabitants and which is only the second Member State in the EU from the point of view of the number of cases submitted in 2009. Indeed, the resolution rate is amazingly good, but the time periods are dreadful, with an average of 15 weeks before cases are dealt with, which is five weeks beyond the maximum allowed. I would therefore ask the Commission and the Member States to grant real financial and human resources and to conduct major information campaigns, aimed especially at businesses, which submitted no more cases in 2009 than in 2004. Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have already discussed the fears linked to the transposition of the Services Directive. In this sense, the example of the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications is symbolic. Some States have failed to respect the transposition deadline and are having problems due to the gaps in the text. Although this directive lays a solid foundation for mutual recognition, the specific characteristics of certain professions have not been taken into account. The fact is, recognising qualifications without having established actual common levels of qualification and training, including for higher education, can only cause complications and create mistrust on the part of Member States, professionals and the citizens. The most obvious example is that of the medical professions. For example, French midwives are authorised to write prescriptions and are trained for that, which is not the case in other countries. What happens when a midwife without such authorisation arrives in France without additional training and has to write a medical prescription? Similarly, certain specialisms do not exist in every Member State. This directive is crucial to the free movement of workers, the foundation on which the European project is based, but it must be improved and enhanced, and the difficulties encountered must serve to identify the professions for which language teaching and harmonised training are necessary. I should like to mention the remarkable initiative, which is supported by all health professionals, to create a European card. This is a genuine guarantee as much for the carrier as for the customer or patient, and I call on the Commission to extend it to other professions, since this will enable us to improve mutual recognition and to gain the citizens’ trust.

 I am delighted to see this lengthy, highly controversial work reach its conclusion; it shows the importance of the telecommunications sector not only as an economic player but also as a vital element in today’s society. Our citizens communicate across borders on a daily basis and our aim was to guarantee quality of services while ensuring that users’ fundamental rights were respected. I want to congratulate Mrs Trautmann and the negotiating team for the compromise they have achieved, making any sanctions taken against users subject to a prior contradictory procedure. Furthermore, the Commission was committed to guaranteeing net neutrality and to combating anti-competitive, discriminatory practices carried out by operators. This agreement will mean consumers benefit from many positive developments which were sometimes the result of tough negotiations. I particularly wish to highlight guaranteed access and localisation for calls made to the emergency number (112); improved access for the disabled; greater information on contracts and billing; warnings in cases of unusually high usage; the introduction of a maximum delay when transferring a customer’s telephone number; and information in cases of security breaches relating to personal data.

Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since its adoption and the heated debates that surrounded it, the Services Directive has somewhat faded into obscurity, but it is important to show that we are particularly vigilant in the crucial phase of its transposition. I question the interpretation of the provisions of Article 2 of the directive linked to the exclusion of social services from its scope. Notions such as ‘support for persons in need’ and ‘mandated providers’ seem restrictive when compared with the definition of social services used in certain Member States, and I am concerned that a deliberately strict interpretation may serve to justify the inclusion of whole swathes of these services in the scope of the directive. The exclusion of these services is a key element of the text and a guarantee for the citizens that the European social model will be protected. I hope that certain Member States, including France, will not take advantage of the transposition in order to liberalise social services, under the false pretext that they are complying with European laws. These problems to do with the integration of services of general interest demonstrate the need to have European legislation that is specific to them and not to stick to a default definition as part of a directive on commercial services.

I voted against Mr Barroso’s candidacy, above all, because I believe in a genuinely political Europe, which cannot be satisfied with a Commission bound by the desiderata of big business. I also believe that one cannot campaign by calling for another form of European leadership only to then give a blank cheque to a champion of liberalism whose programme is sorely lacking in ambition and values. A man who has taken shelter behind the idea of ‘better regulation’ in order to ‘deregulate’ everything that I, as a socialist, defend: public services, social protection of workers, respect for health systems, regulation of the financial economy and protection of consumers and of the environment against the power of industrial groups. Out of respect for my own convictions and those of the electorate, I feel that these values cannot be called into question by ulterior motives and tricks aimed at obtaining derisory concessions from conservatives who control the majority of the Member States, the European Parliament and the Commission, and who will not rest until they have furthered their deregulatory policy.

Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, this summer our Member States reached an agreement on a growth pact. In the autumn, they are foolishly unable to agree on the resources for it. Budgetary discipline is one thing, but it is the citizens who are paying the price of the crisis because of the loss of jobs. They are waiting for policies that promote economic recovery, reinvigorate the internal market and ensure greater solidarity. That is why, like other Members – and I say this straight away to President Barroso – we cannot accept the Commission’s proposal as a ceiling; it is the absolute lowest level to which the European Parliament could sink. The proposals of the Cypriot Presidency, like those of Mr Van Rompuy, are just not enough. They are not enough to enable us to achieve a balance that encourages regional development and regional fairness, between the agriculture and Cohesion Fund policies, for example. They are not enough for a number of activities that guarantee the European Union’s competitiveness, such as industrial policy, research and the Connecting Europe Facility. They are not enough to offer guarantees for young people, access to training, Erasmus funding, or consideration of all young people for lifelong learning, as well as lifelong learning for other groups, such as adults and older people. As Mr Barroso said, that is the fifth freedom. Finally, there are no longer any resources for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund or food aid for the most deprived. Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore ask you to make a real investment in infrastructure, in the economy, and in the future of our young people. Catherine Trautmann,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets
. − Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, among the numerous challenges that the introduction of the European Semester presents, I would like to mention two key aspects. First of all, this mechanism must not simply be an instrument for formal surveillance of budgetary policies between Member States and by the Commission. On the contrary, the European Semester must allow sincere and in-depth collaboration between the European Parliament and national parliaments, in keeping with our respective competences and the democratic principle. It is the only valid way forward with a view to complementarity of national budgetary policies. Secondly, with regard to the European budget: our Parliament, by a massive vote in favour of the Kalfin and Böge report, pointed out that 94 % of this budget was an investment budget. On that basis, I proposed, in my opinion included in the report, exploring the possibility of excluding Member States’ contributions to the EU budget from the calculation of the structural deficit, as defined in the two-pack, the six-pack and the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (TSCG). Our Parliament is conducting the mother of all battles, for a European budget that meets the overall interests of the EU and its citizens. That is the direction of this proposal, addressed both to net contributory and beneficiary States. It would free up budget negotiation. In fact, it would make it possible to leave behind the damaging logic of fair return and the search for rebates and move to an approach based on contribution in the noblest sense of the term. In addition, such a calculation method would make the most of all payments to our common budget, including those made by beneficiaries. Consequently, I ask Mr Gauzès, our rapporteur, to look again at his request, on behalf of the PPE, to remove this proposal. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr Barroso, I think the State of the Union, for us members, is the State of Europeans. Europeans are troubled by three things: financial matters, health and employment. I would have liked to have talked about protecting people’s savings. I would have liked more ambition on the issue of re-equipping our industries through energy, the environment and digital technology. I would also have liked you to show a little more insight. If we are actually going to get out of this crisis, we need a timetable that is appropriate for the efforts of Member States and citizens. I would add, in this respect, that there is no democratic progress without social rights and, on a social level, as some have said, it is still not good enough. We need guarantees in terms of employment, in terms of not attacking the European social model as well as guarantees in terms of the financial and fiscal effort of all those who elect us and who want to regain confidence in the European Union. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).  
– (FR) 
Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, the decision taken in Brussels is a welcome breath of fresh air, and even if there remains a lot to do, the conclusions of this summit mark the end of an era and represent the first stage of a revival for our citizens, that of a Europe that gives itself the means to be fairer and show more solidarity. The issue of growth is no longer taboo and the discussion about the broad economic guidelines is now under way. The European Union will not be able to emerge from the rut of the crisis without breaking the vicious circle of austerity, which could condemn Member States to an endless recession. I am delighted that this sound political sense can at last be found in the conclusions and I am glad that France and its President, Mr Hollande, have contributed to this political rebalancing and are committed, out of solidarity, to the path of integration. However, although hope is essential, full implementation is what will restore confidence permanently. With EUR 120 billion having been mobilised within the framework of the Growth and Employment Pact, and EUR 10 billion of recapitalisation from the European Investment Bank (EIB), these will allow bonds to be issued for the purpose of financing projects. The European Parliament must be heard concerning a coherent financial framework and own resources. The mobilisation of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the launch of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which we would have liked to see granted a banking licence, is the most urgent matter for Spain and Italy, without forgetting the Greek citizens who have been hit hard by the crisis. The quick implementation of a banking supervisor for the euro area is only the first step towards banking union, which Parliament strongly advocates. Moreover, we cannot content ourselves with a limited tax on financial transactions, even if its implementation within the framework of enhanced cooperation could constitute a first step. In this way, we expect a lot from the next European Council, where the group of four – four Presidents, of course – will have to propose an ambitious road map in order to advance economic and monetary union and to enable the definitive resolution of the sovereign debt crisis and the instability of the euro area. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to give our fellow citizens concrete proof of our capacity to resolve the crisis, first and foremost, through growth fuelled by investment. Can you justify, in these times of precarious employment, doing away with the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), which is supposed to support workers who have lost their jobs because of globalisation, especially when we have to reinvent an industrial policy for Europe? Solidarity and insecurity are affecting a new population of young people, unemployed workers, women and pensioners. Yet those same people who were unable to manage this crisis would choose to do away with the European food distribution programme? Mr President, I ask that it be maintained beyond 2013, without doing away with any other essential programmes. The last aspect is cohesion. The regions must not be held responsible for the poor management of the Member States. We reject the strengthening of macro-economic conditionality because, in a time of crisis, we need to be able to adjust the support policies where economic growth is regional and where jobs can be provided. We therefore stand alongside the trade unions and NGOs that are fighting for solidarity, and alongside the regions, which must play a key role in the vitality of the territories in order to promote more growth, employment and social justice. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, Greece has been forced into an endless spiral of austerity and today, these modern-day doctors Diafoirus, these advocates of blood-letting, are refusing to deliver the aid promised. How do we explain this to the Greek citizens who are being doubly punished with pressure and injustice? There are alternative approaches. Let me propose one: the fight against tax avoidance. The tax haven provided by Switzerland costs Greece an estimated EUR 16.4 billion in loss of earnings. Tackling this resolutely would enable Greece to get back on track with the stability pact without sacrificing the future. Greece has been pushed by circumstances into considering a bilateral agreement with Switzerland, similar to the Rubik agreements signed by the United Kingdom and Germany. Executing this partial levy on fraudulent investments, instead of prosecuting fraudsters, is institutional recognition of tax fraud and a bad deal financially. The Union should follow the example of the United States, which has successfully forced Switzerland to provide the bank details of suspected fraudsters. What are the Commission’s plans now that its services have concluded the illegality of these agreements in a note that I believe should be made public? What does it suggest for the future now that its proposed Savings Tax Directive has been buried by the Council and, in particular, by Germany? In short, what does it intend to propose so as to stop constantly penalising the poor? I would like it if the Commissioner could respond because this question is important, but I can see that he has not been listening. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, I am not going to give in to politicking – I want to assure Mr Reul of that – because I believe that this treaty is setting us up for failure and I deeply regret it. I regret it because it is inefficient in its response to the market in the face of the crisis as it does not rebuild confidence. We have seen the problems Greece and Portugal have had in the same period. We are seeing two countries, who are the greatest contributors to our budget, France and Germany, whose growth rates have been halved. We understand that it is the wording of this treaty which, normally, should have served to settle things and reassure everyone, including the people. In reality, it is the action of the ECB which has had a positive effect, by making over EUR 500 billion of liquidities available to the banks. However, in Parliament, we must realise that we have to be consistent. We are elected by our voters; and our voters are the retired people who are in debt, the workers who marched through the streets of Brussels, the unemployed people waiting for work, and the young people who want to have a future. We cannot content ourselves with criticising a treaty which is based solely on fiscal discipline, on penalties, and which, even worse, introduces government by the judiciary to the detriment of the sovereignty of national parliaments. We, the Members of the European Parliament, should rise up against this outcome and put forward proposals. I, for one, have proposals that I should like to put forward. This is not simply about criticising. I believe, Mr President, that what we can propose today for Europe is a virtuous circle, a European pact of responsibility, governance and growth. This treaty must be renegotiated, on a basis which allows for true coordination of economic policies, including industrial projects to provide work for our factories and our workers, projects in the fields of energy and the environment, the creation of Eurobonds, which have regrettably been forgotten about or crossed off the agenda, and financial regulation. We need justice, we need solidarity. That is what we must defend in Parliament. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, the cheers that accompanied this agreement have already stopped. Is anyone surprised? The package offers no immediate solution to the crisis: no pooling of debt via Eurobonds – even though they have Mr Van Rompuy’s backing – and no strengthening of the European Financial Stability Facility or provision of a banking licence to enable it to raise funds via the ECB, which will not intervene in sovereign debt matters. What happened to using the tax on financial transactions as a fair taxation tool and an own resource? Perhaps there is no longer any urgency. After all, Mr Sarkozy, having pushed through two austerity plans in order to maintain France’s AAA rating, declared yesterday that a rating downgrade was not such a big obstacle to overcome. Who are they trying to kid? In the longer term, this agreement will be one of sanctions and fear, and it will put a little more pressure on the Member States, which are already struggling. The austerity policies decreed by ‘Merkozy’ are set to plunge Europe back into recession, and Europeans into unemployment. Where is the solidarity? Where are the jobs and growth? Europe is not a poor Union, but it needs to revitalise its industry, develop its infrastructure and offer its young people prospects for the future. This requires investment, which the Member States and the Union should be helped to finance. This is what justifies revising this Treaty. Any other decision would mean bypassing the national parliaments and the European Parliament and would thus be undemocratic. How can one explain the fact that a future French presidential candidate consulted neither the opposition parties nor his parliament before pledging his country’s signature? That is something that no one can understand or accept. Catherine Trautmann,

Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, during the negotiations on the telecoms package, the European Parliament already advocated the need to respect the Internet’s neutrality. Transparency on how traffic is managed in times of network overload and a minimum quality of service are basic requirements, but the persistent blocking of Internet content, as was just mentioned, or applications shows that these requirements are not enough. Let us therefore remember the essential nature of the Internet for fundamental rights and media pluralism and the need to ensure the confidentiality of communications and people’s private lives. Telecoms operators can contribute to economic recovery. They must be given the opportunity to innovate and invest in the development of new services, but the quality of basic Internet services, with which we are familiar, must not under any circumstances be allowed to decline in favour of paid services. We oppose the creation of a two-speed Internet which would be discriminatory for the most modest-income households, who are already hard-hit by the crisis. Finally, if the findings of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) require it, we would ask the Commission to assume its responsibilities and produce a binding text which ensures the Internet’s neutrality. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, our colleague who has just spoken is right. We need networks, we need an economic development model which gives us a future in every sector. Let us take the case of youth employment. There is no way we can believe in the future and trust policies when youth unemployment is over 15% or 20% and when young people are even denied a first job. I was disappointed by what Mr Barroso had to say. I would have liked practical solutions, for instance, priority access to public procurement for companies that hire young people for their first job. I would have also liked the Commission to present a tailored strategy for development. Yes, we have regions in Europe that are worse off than others. Yes, we have pockets of poverty and, with that in mind, we found out that one Head of State was calling into question the sustainability of the funding for the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union (PEAD). If there is no future for young people, if there is no solution for the most deprived, if there is no development strategy, you have enough resources to carry out social impact assessments, sector by sector, to determine where jobs can be created in companies, industry and services. It is not enough to say or claim that we could guarantee job security; we must ensure that the young and unemployed can access qualified jobs that enable them to find a solution, since without a job, there is no social dignity. How much progress has the Commission made on the Posting of Workers Directive, Commissioner? We have been waiting a long time for the divide between our countries concerning human resources and employees to be removed. I would like and hope to receive specific answers from you and I shall conclude by saying that I am disappointed that Mr Barroso only devoted one hour to a year-long programme that is meant to bring about a sustainable recovery and a permanent resolution to our Member States’ sovereign debt.

 Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, this morning my feelings are both of relief and concern. I feel relieved because at least last night’s agreement exists as we could not risk another failure. The restructuring of the Greek debt takes the European contribution to more than EUR 200 billion, adding together private debts, the euro area stability fund and the public aid plan. The first stage of recapitalising the banks loosens the current stranglehold by increasing own funds. I particularly welcome the increase of the European Financial Stability Facility rescue fund to EUR 1 000 billion, at last, in my view, as the socialists have always believed that this fund was not sufficiently resourced. However, as a European, let me share with you the reasons for my concern, which are serious ones. I fear that all we did last night was to increase our capacity to carry out a patch-up job, and that we neglected the foundations of our common edifice. On reading this agreement, I can see grounds for two major reservations: firstly, its ‘short term’ nature. The measures adopted this morning relate exclusively to finance and in no way provide a long-term solution to the need for economic integration. This morning, the Council responded to the European banking, debt and euro crisis: that was a vital step. However, the lack of prospects for growth and the silence on economic convergence and employment allow some people to continue to speculate about how fragile we are. At a time when we should be carrying out structural reforms to invest in and kick-start growth, we are recommended to opt for the ‘Euro Plus Pact’. We do not accept that. Let us not replace excessive dependency on the market by dependency on competitor nations which do not comply either with social or environmental standards. The second reservation: budgetary authoritarianism, which adds enforcement to austerity. In point of fact, we face two crucial tasks today: to clean up our public finances and to kick-start growth. The balance between these two must be a political choice. It flows from a decision that we make for the people of Europe that we represent. The Court of Justice should not be a substitute for political will and our duty to show solidarity. We must not revise the treaty under pressure from speculators. The choice of further integration is our political duty, and that of this Parliament. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission needs to prove today that the industrial policy it stands for is not an empty promise. As has already been said, we cannot accept that economically viable sites equipped with high-performance tools and skilled employees may be shut down because of a cynical calculation of profits. As far as the Florange site is concerned, I call on the Commission to speed up its selection process for the NER 300 programme, because we must examine all the other options for maintaining activity on European soil. Indeed, this site brings together, under the Ultra-Low Carbon dioxide (CO2
) Steelmaking (ULCOS) programme, all the elements needed to set up a pilot project in the field of CO2
 capture and storage, thereby striking a difficult balance between heavy industry and environmental protection. The fact is, the more blast furnaces are shut down for the long term, the more it will cost to start them back up again, and the greater the risk of this project failing, which would be catastrophic not only for the Lorraine steelmaking area but also, on a wider scale, for all the regions in Europe that are interested in reproducing this kind of equipment. The European Union was born out of steel and steelmaking. We cannot let it disintegrate and perish because of a financial crisis and because of the demise of steelmaking, for the sake of our jobs, our regions and our workers. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, unlike the French Government, I sincerely hope we will have a major public debate. We need comprehensive stress tests. Fukushima has shown that we must imagine the unimaginable. The method currently used fails to take into account risks such as terrorist attacks or plane crashes, and therefore does not meet this requirement. We need a transparent debate, because the choice whether to continue or stop must be based on broad public consensus that is informed but not bypassed by expert discussions. We need an independent debate in the presence of all parties, so as to avoid potential conflicts of interest and promote appeasement. Finally, I am from Alsace and therefore know the extent to which the Fessenheim nuclear power plant concerns our German and Swiss neighbours. Instead of establishing full national control over these issues, why not at least encourage a sharing of expertise between our security agencies? Security would benefit, as would transparency and citizenship at European level. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this very fine report by our fellow Member, Mr Audy, summarises all our discussions with the operators in the sector. I am not going to go over their assessment of our Seventh Framework Programme: that it is indispensable but too complicated and too bureaucratic. I would just like to emphasise two points. Firstly, innovation. Parliament has pledged to promote it, but it must not do so at the expense of fundamental research. As we well know, the main result of research is knowledge, followed by the opportunity to enhance that result in the economic sector, or indeed the industrial sector. A clear distinction must be made, then, between the manipulation and the enhancement of fundamental research. Secondly, financing. We all agree that the budget should match our ambitions. I would go so far as to say that, on this issue, we should be innovative by being consistent. It is pointless bringing in more instruments; let us make the existing ones more effective. In this respect, the risk-sharing finance facility is a real success, but it must take a more inclusive approach to SMEs and research infrastructure. I therefore call on the Commission to do everything in its power to solve the disputes as quickly as possible and to take into account the courses of action proposed in this report. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we set ourselves the objective of strengthening our capacity for innovation and investment or the competitive advantage to be found with the United States and China, we speak of economic development, certainly, but specifically, we also speak of creating jobs. For that reason, we must give ourselves the means to strengthen innovation. I would like to congratulate Mrs Merkies on the one-stop shop, the funding strategy, and the recognition of necessary risk-taking by researchers. Her report points in the right direction and proposes a context that is favourable to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are essential to the success of the European Union. Innovation means attractiveness and competitiveness of the territories, and the involvement of the regional and local authorities is essential in terms of committing appropriations, reducing disparities and enhancing the active role that citizens must play. It is directly on the ground that the measure proposed in this report will contribute effectively to the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives. Catherine Trautmann,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fishermen have told us that it is becoming harder for them to make a living from their work. On top of the particularly painful situation for them of a reduction in fishing quotas and plans for exit from the fleet, there is now the added problem of soaring oil prices. Although the price has fallen slightly, it continues to fluctuate, and for two years now, this situation has been affecting the daily lives of all our European fishermen, in particular, in the small-scale and coastal fishing sector. This situation is extremely worrying, and we are anxious to show fishermen that we are fully behind them. To do so, we call on the European Commission to raise the threshold of de minimis
 aid that can be granted to them to help them cope with this crisis. This is simply a temporary measure, justified by an urgent situation. The Commission already reacted to a similar phenomenon in 2007, and in the face of this new peak, we wish to know what concrete measures – you have already given details of some of them – it intends to take. We also feel it is crucial, as Mrs Fraga Estévez said, to verify that the Member States are using all of the funds currently set aside by the regulation. At a time when the future common fisheries policy appears to be taking shape, I believe that our fishermen are not resistant to change; quite the contrary. Many of them told me that they were willing to make an effort, particularly in terms of preserving stocks. This is, in fact, a collective responsibility. In order to make that effort, they must not fall victim to factors outside their work over which they have absolutely no control. A swift and effective response by you, Commissioner, on this point would send a signal that would also help strengthen what we know are historically fragile links between the Commission and the profession. Catherine Trautmann,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to give our verdict at first reading on the draft radio spectrum policy programme, and I should like to thank the Commission for having supported and transformed this proposal, which was first tabled during our debates on the telecoms package. I should also like to commend our rapporteur, Mr Hökmark, as well as my fellow shadow rapporteurs, for our good cooperation on a report which reveals some major political issues hidden behind its highly technical aspects. We have had numerous debates, which have really made me see that Parliament and the Commission do, quite naturally, share the same opinion and ambition. The opinion is that spectrum is a scarce resource that does not recognise borders. Everyone seems to agree on this point. However, it is on the solutions to be found to improve its management and on the general ambition that some differences can be observed, in particular with the Member States, which I do not deny have historically had a certain sovereign responsibility. Although not all the compromises tabled and adopted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy are as balanced as I personally would have liked, I support very sincerely the general move to develop a spectrum management approach that is more integrated, realistic and responsive to the social, cultural and economic needs of our fellow citizens. This is a common thread in all the positions adopted by our Parliament, Commissioner, be it on the own-initiative report by my colleague, Mrs Toia, or on the proposals that I myself defended as one of the rapporteurs for the telecoms package. With regard to the radio spectrum policy programme, my group and I placed particular emphasis on several points in our amendments. They include, therefore, introducing transparency so as to learn how spectrum is currently allocated and managed – that is, the inventory principle – and also finding innovative and original solutions to the electronic communications sector’s growing demand for use of frequencies. They need to be qualitative, not just quantitative, solutions. By emphasising spectral efficiency, we will remedy this situation without limiting the diversity of services available on the spectrum. In doing so, we are also using spectrum as a vehicle for bridging the digital divide and developing new services that are within the reach not only of large telecommunications companies but also of SMEs and start-ups, which will need them. I believe that this economic dimension is essential. To conclude, I should like to say a few words about the next stage. As you said yourself, it was clear from the start that a first-reading agreement was out of the question, but it is imperative that we reach an agreement by the end of the year. This is essential for our public services, for meeting consumers’ expectations, and for developing the Internet regardless of the infrastructure in place. It is also essential for planning the economic recovery of our European Union thanks to this resource. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, nuclear power is a non-carbon energy source, but also a transitional energy source which depends on exhaustible resources. It is also a potentially dangerous form of energy. The obvious priority, after Fukushima, is to take a view on the safety of our power stations. These stress tests must be carried out in the most coordinated way possible at Union level, and potentially beyond in our immediate neighbourhood, by independent entities working in accordance with the strictest standards and with the greatest transparency. Next, the fight against climate change requires a coherent and ambitious policy. While nuclear power means that we can emit less CO2
 into the atmosphere to produce the electricity we need, we must not be dependent on it. In countries such as France which produce nuclear power, reducing its share is a precondition for any far-reaching decision. This process means that we must redouble our efforts when it comes to saving energy and increasing the share of renewables, which, in the medium and long-term, will be able to cover almost all of our consumption. This is about the safety of power stations, but it must also be about the security of provision throughout the European Union, so that no country finds itself in economic difficulty. Finally, true solidarity requires the creation of an Energy Community. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, I thank my fellow Member, Mr Rübig, for asking this question. I think that, actually, the French regulator is independent – his proposals are testament to that. I think that, given the logic of what I mentioned concerning the European Energy Community, we should have an independent regulator at European level and make available the supervisory means to ensure that the regulator’s work is independent and that the regulator is genuinely competent.

Mr President, at national level, it is always possible to question the composition and, from this point of view, I agree with Mrs Lepage’s comment. I think that we will soon see a period in which pluralism can be better ensured, but in any case, I would not want to question the honesty of the work by those people who have taken up their task conscientiously, and one person in particular, Mr Lacoste. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, I would like to thank Bernd Lange for his excellent work. Tomorrow, his collaborative method will be crowned with success. Moreover, Commissioner, this is an opportunity for the Commission, which provided us with a rather disappointing communication. As someone who hails from a large region heavily hit by the crisis, when it had already been affected by industrial restructuring, I have listened to the message of the unions, which have constantly challenged us. We need an industrial policy, all of whose components work towards the same goal: constructing a strategy that is based on sustainable, employment-centred growth that is built around the optimisation of skills and which shows that social and technological innovations are compatible with each other. That is the key to European competitiveness and not the use of the workforce as an adjustment variable, as the Commission proposed in the European semester. The best move the Commission could make is to rapidly integrate the Posting of Workers Directive into the work programme and to begin fiscal harmonisation starting with corporate taxation. Furthermore, this policy should take shape not only at national and European level, but also at local level in the context of an effective cohesion policy. Our choice is a regulated financial market, and we share the desire to consolidate the single market, but not at the expense of an inequitable labour market which is subject to social dumping. Today, Madam President, we are debating an ambitious industrial policy, and this morning, we voted on a tax on financial transactions, and on Eurobonds. Ladies and gentlemen, we must use these means to finance it. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment which is currently being examined by the Lithuanian Parliament and which would make it a punishable offence to publicly promote homosexuality, was drafted within the framework of a law for the protection of minors against the detrimental effects of public information. How can we, supposedly for the sake of protecting minors, undermine both freedom of expression and of information, and, above all, sanction discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation? We know very well that a text of this kind leads to concealing one’s sexual orientation and runs counter to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) rights which we have defended and which this Parliament has defended. Furthermore, at a time when we are witnessing acts of violence and aggression towards homosexuals, this is an incitement to criminalising homosexuality and a call for violence. We cannot give to young people an image of Europe as a society that is closed, intolerant, inward-looking and that disregards respect for other people. For us, therefore, this law is in complete contradiction with European values, as contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. As has been said, it also goes against the whole antidiscriminatory corpus of Union law, which has greatly contributed to making our national laws more egalitarian in many aspects of everyday life from employment to information or education. I thank you, Commissioner, for making a very clear statement, and I would like all groups to understand your argument as well as that of my fellow Members. I would like to call upon all fellow Members from all the political groups to join with the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&amp;D), the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), the Greens/European Free Alliance (Verts/ALE) and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL), who have taken the initiative in drafting this resolution. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, the euro is our common asset and, today, the trade unions told Parliament that they were concerned that employees themselves were paying the price for the crisis through a weak euro, a euro under attack and not through a growth-promoting, job-creating euro. It is therefore essential that we do not pursue a simple technical revision of the treaties and that the two major dysfunctions of the euro area revealed by the crisis are addressed. The first approach is to introduce eurobonds, as we have heard. Eurobonds will not only stabilise the level of the euro, they will also immediately counter the speculative attack. The second approach to introducing fiscal justice and to making the financial market pay the price for the crisis is precisely to introduce a tax on financial transactions so that it is not employees who, as a result of fiscal injustice, pay the price for this crisis. Finally, a European debt agency must be established, which must be able to pool some of the sovereign debt of the Member States. Finally, I would also like to support Mr Juncker and to say that increasing the stability fund, which was proposed by Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Director-General of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is a good idea. Early intervention – as we have heard – not being late and choosing to become strong and not weak would enable us to perform an act of governance that would re-introduce the confidence called for by our President, Martin Schultz. (Applause) Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, my group, in fact, wishes to see the two oral questions concerning both the report of the Van Rompuy task force and the six Commission legislative packages on economic governance reinstated in the order of business. Firstly, for an institutional reason, since Article 9 of the Treaty of Lisbon gives us this prerogative and this authority to have applied the horizontal social clause and, in particular, the study on the social impact for the sweeping measures, the sweeping directives and decisions that have consequences for our citizens. Mr John Monks, the General Secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, has just written about his concern at seeing austerity plans having a direct impact on the incomes of wage earners, their wages and also their pensions. The political reason for making this request, Mr President, on behalf of my group, is that we must show that, at a time when we are discussing market regulation, we are not only giving our verdict on the markets, but also voting and legislating in favour of our fellow citizens. I should like to see this House feel able to support the reinstatement of these oral questions. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, this work programme presents the recovery of growth and jobs, as well as economic regulation, as key to restoring confidence. That is true. Our model of economic development can no longer make do with strengthening the enforcement aspect of a Stability Pact that has continually shown its limitations. The recovery of growth must be centred on job creation throughout the Union in its entirety. We need to look at employment and social standards as indicators of economic power and, from that point of view, emphasise the need to put more thought into the European tax on financial transactions and into a greater coordination between the European Union and the European ministers for employment, as well as into the Union’s economic proposals. I support the Members who took the floor to highlight the importance of the directive on the posting of workers and on the services of general interest. I think that the European Union’s digital strategy is a crucial factor for this new economy. We should show more recognition of the Commission’s ambition on this point. With regard to citizenship, the Union should put the citizens back at the heart of the European project, and the increase in financial allocations should not only focus on security aspects, in particular, on managing migratory flows. Finally, I would end, Mr President, by saying that, in essence, this work programme for 2011 should be the very example of a policy that addresses in a positive way this temptation for nations to withdraw, which all our Member States are experiencing. I believe the European Commission has the power to change things. It can rely on a Parliament which will be a proactive force and will support it if it shows more ambition. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, the state of the Union for us today, in France, is that the citizens, the people, and also the streets are rumbling with discontent. Our fellow European citizens are experiencing an unprecedented crisis of confidence, and they have decided to march to the beat of refusal and demands, but also of hope. What is behind this is a failed proposal for reforming pensions, but not only this. What is at stake is getting older in a dignified manner. What is at stake is ensuring an intergenerational solidarity which allows the youngest people today also to live their working life, their professional life, with a pension from which they can benefit. On this very subject, Mr Barroso, the Commission published a Green Paper on the reform of pension systems which unleashed a wave of anxiety from the trade unions before the summer. The proposal that you have made to increase the retirement age seems unrealistic to me. It would be more useful if the Commission told us how we can make sure that workers are able to keep their jobs up to the legal retirement age. I would like to hear your proposals, and I would also like to hear some details on what you called the fiscal consolidation rather than the economic coordination of our Member States, which I think must be oriented towards social solidarity. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).

Mr President, I would like to congratulate our fellow Member Mr Cadec on his excellent work. The text put to the vote today marks a certain change in the way our institution views the concept of free trade. Without being protectionist, the line defended here may be described as less naïve. We all agree that European production is insufficient, and rather than immediately resorting to imports, we must first try to intensify our efforts to safeguard and regenerate stocks, including through the use of aquaculture, to ensure the sustainability of the sector and its jobs in the Union, as well as European fisheries that are less dependent on third countries. As for imports, we must guarantee that the European market in fishery and aquaculture products does not suffer unfair competition as a result of less strict health and social conditions and ludicrously low tariffs. That is why I favour a European label, in accordance with our standards, both environmental and social. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, you told us earlier that Europeans must be firm and united if they are to succeed at the G20, and that the European Union’s credibility on the international stage is at stake. However, what is at stake, above all, is the Union’s credibility in the eyes of its citizens, who expect it to be able to equip itself with credible instruments to exit the crisis. Firstly, I expected the conclusions of the European Council of 17 June to treat EU budgetary discipline, macro-economic surveillance and the regulation of financial services equally. It has to be said that this was not the case. Secondly, having clearly lacked internal solidarity in the face of the crisis, the European Union has a duty to lead the efforts to emerge from it. Let us be frank. Economic and monetary union is suffering from a structural fault, which creates an imbalance between monetary policy and economic policy, even though today, the euro accounts for 27% of the global reserves of central banks. That obliges the Member States and the Eurogroup to coordinate national economic policies. The euro must not be the symbol of high prices for our fellow citizens, and our duty today, at the end of these interim Councils, is no longer to simply reassure the markets. It is to reassure citizens of our ability to exit the crisis together. Thirdly, the tougher stance on budgetary discipline, at this time of crisis, must not aggravate the recession. We want evidence, evidence that the 2020 strategy will actually be accompanied by financial resources that are sufficient to develop, but also guide, the economy towards the spending of the future, towards employment and towards solid and fertile investments. Presidents, we must hear the warning being expressed today in anger and soon in fear. Identified as it is with unfair liberalism, the European Union must not become the symbol of brutal austerity. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, may I congratulate Mr Romeva i Rueda, who has managed to include the technical provisions resulting directly from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) meeting in Recife, as has already been said, while leaving open the possibility of adding further rules that might arise from forthcoming negotiations. This report also includes elements that will enable us to combat the phenomenon of illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing, and provides guidelines as regards stock regulation. I particularly support the report. Our vote is taking place at a fairly fraught time, following the European Commission’s decision last week to close purse seiner bluefin tuna fishing early. While a common ground appears to have been found – and for that I would like to acknowledge the step taken by Commissioner Damanaki, who reached an agreement with France, allocating additional quotas for small-scale and coastal fishing – there is still some doubt over the situation concerning purse seiners. The constraints faced by fishermen are very strict, and it is this kind of uncertainty that we must avoid, for our fishermen have to be sure they have a stable and level playing field. It is this objective of predictability that we will pursue in negotiations on the reform of the common fisheries policy. Predictability and sustainability must go together, particularly as regards decisions necessary for safeguarding stocks and the sector’s long-term future, as well as fishermen’s activity and income in the short term, with the objective being a fisheries sector that respects marine resources. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us say this clearly: the way in which the negotiations on the Anti­Counterfeiting Trade Agreement are being carried out is unacceptable to the European Parliament. As a new colegislator on this issue, the Treaty of Lisbon now guarantees us the right to full information at the same time as it is received by the Council. The documents that have ‘leaked out’ up to now have proved to us that, as far as form is concerned, this dimension absolutely was not respected. What can be said about the content? The fool’s bargain that seems to have been offered to Internet access providers is as follows: should they decide to cooperate in the systematic monitoring of the content carried on their networks, their current non­liability for such content would be maintained. Otherwise, they would be exposing themselves to legal actions by right holders and would be systematically penalised. I find such a turnaround extremely dangerous, as it would call into question the acquis communautaire
, not only on the principle of mere conduit – referred to in French as simple transport 
– in the e­Commerce Directive, but also in relation to respect for the fundamental rights of the citizens, which was brought up recently in our debate on the Telecoms package. I will conclude by reminding you that our Chamber has already shown its attachment to these principles by rejecting the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) Agreement. I have no doubt about its ability to start again. Therefore, I am anxious to stress the importance of the resolution that is being debated this evening. I welcome the work of our coordinator, Mr Arif, and of all of the negotiators from the Committee on International Trade, who have ensured that the signal that the European Parliament will give tomorrow will be extremely symbolic because it is unanimous. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Presidents, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, may I thank all the rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and for the huge task accomplished in spite of what were at times conflicting interests. The first result of our efforts is that Parliament can now state the direction in which it intends to steer the future common fisheries policy. The second result is that, during the negotiations, our priority was to ensure that this text responds to the concerns expressed by fishermen. We have succeeded in this: the provisions relating to transferable individual quotas have been withdrawn, and support for small-scale and coastal fishing has been maintained. The third anticipated result is that the forthcoming document must result in a participative and bottom-up approach, that is to say, in consultation with all those involved in the sector. It must also incorporate those elements that are essential to the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, notably, the human and social dimension of the entire sector, which must be combined effectively with the promotion of sustainable fishing practices and with the conservation of the fish stock as part of an ecosystemic approach. I would like to add that, if we want to succeed in an ambitious reform of the common fisheries policy, then we must devote a budget to it that matches our stated ambitions. Our political commitment will be judged according to the resources that we grant it. We expect the Commission … (The President cut off the speaker) Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Zapatero, thank you first of all, Mr Zapatero, for reintroducing ambition, political perspective and also energy, at a time when the European Union has to bounce back from the crisis and in the wake of the failure in Copenhagen. I expect the Commission and the Presidency to enable us to put the creation of more and higher quality jobs, the fight against social exclusion, and sustainable development at the heart of the 2020 strategy. This is true in particular for the agriculture budget, and also for the fisheries budget. You have committed yourself to this. Mr Zapatero, we are counting on you to provide the resources for this policy, to associate the decontamination of soil with food security, to create the conditions for green jobs and for the preservation of fisheries resources, to ensure food security and to create fairer trading conditions for the countries of the South. We need an ambitious agriculture budget, and I would also ask you to link the fisheries budget with this budget. On these points, our jobs, but also our policy, will be judged on the basis of the results achieved. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

Presidents, Minister, the Swedish Presidency has had what may be described as some historic moments: the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the appointments of the first President of the European Council and of the High Representative, but also the climate change conference and the appointment of a new Commission, as well as – please allow me this brief reference – the telecoms package. These events have created hope. All things considered, however, there remain one or two mixed results. Firstly, our Parliament, being committed to the introduction of European supervision of the financial markets, welcomed the proposals made by Mr de Larosière’s group of wise men as a crucial step. However, the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council of 2 December are well below this realistic level of ambition. I wish to mention at this point that Parliament will be sure to restore some balance to the proposals that have been referred to it, in order to make the financial markets more robust. The same applies to the financial commitments pledged to the countries of the South to help them combat climate change. Even though, in Copenhagen, poor countries require real commitments concerning long-term financing, the Council has only managed to pledge EUR 7.2 billion over three years. This is a first step, true, but it falls far short of the requirements, all the more so since part of it comes from a restructuring exercise. Lastly, in the financial field, we welcome the will to impose rules and to act forcefully with regard to both supervision and taxation. I note in particular, in the Council conclusions, the reference to a global financial transaction levy. This is something for which we socialists have been hoping and praying for more than 10 years. There is still work to be done. Seeking out new financial resources to promote employment, solidarity within and outside Europe, and the financing of the fight against climate change, is a major challenge. As it will soon be Christmas, I invite the Council to give us a decision on own resources in the years to come. Catherine Trautmann  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, on Thursday the European Union appointed Mr Van Rompuy as its first permanent President of the Council and Mrs Ashton to be in charge of European diplomacy. Ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to return to the debate that has been taking place in our institutions since these appointments were announced. Indeed, in my opinion, beyond the issue of names and functions, there is the central issue of the States. Let me explain what I mean. We are witnessing what could be the worst nightmare of those who conveyed the ideal of the European Community and their desire for union. At that time, it was believed that the roots of the Union were to be found in state legitimacy and that its future lay in transcending national selfishness. Tension between two contradictory mediums, which is sometimes painful, often produces original mechanisms, but, above all, serves a political approach that is unique in the world. This nightmare, ladies and gentlemen, is that of a Europe that would be limited to a community of intergovernmental acquisitions. The result, as we can see today, would be suspicion of incompetence, presumption of illegitimacy and tension between political families. In making this speech, I do not intend, as you will have gathered, to return to making judgments on mere intent. I prefer to recall with you the rights and duties of we MEPs. Our duty is to question the impenetrable haggling that surrounds appointments to the posts that resulted from the Treaty of Lisbon. Our duty, in future, is to force the Council to put an end to this undemocratic, archaic method of appointment that fosters the idea that Europe, in building itself, is sheltered from the peoples. Our duty is to use all our new parliamentary prerogatives to influence the policies that will result from the new powers guaranteed to us under the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament, between a weakened Commission and a strengthened intergovernmental centre, needs to become the institutional point of equilibrium. On this matter, I hope that the Vice-President of the Commission will be subject to the same hearing process by the European Parliament as the other commissioners. Indeed, we have a right to carry out this process; it is conferred by the treaties. I also support the proposal of Mrs Harms, who has suggested a meeting between the new President and the groups as a whole. Our duty is to kick-start European integration, which is in a seriously bad way. No one can reasonably want the mandates entrusted to Mr Van Rompuy or Mrs Ashton to fail and, more especially, I wish Mrs Ashton every success because I am proud that a woman has been appointed to this post of High Representative.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we are once again – this time for the last time – to discuss the telecom package and, more specifically, my report on the ‘framework’, ‘access’ and ‘authorisation’ directives, which represents the final cornerstone. This is an opportunity for me to thank my colleagues, particularly my co-rapporteurs Pilar del Castillo and Malcolm Harbour; the chair of the Conciliation Committee, Mr Vidal-Quadras; the chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Herbert Reul, and all the services of the European Parliament that were involved. I also wish to thank the Commissioner for her involvement and support throughout this period, and I thank her services as well. Finally, I also welcome the efforts of the Swedish Presidency to reach a satisfying conclusion. Let us take a moment to remember Ulrika Barklund Larsson. Tomorrow’s vote will give a very positive signal to those expecting a more dynamic European industrial policy. As the second reading agreement on 99% of the text has been maintained, I shall just summarise the aspects that we made our priority. In particular, we wanted to maintain effective, lasting competition, but also to make that competition useful to economic and social development through complete coverage of European territory in terms of access, high speed internet for all and for all regions – including better management of radio spectrum – and full rights for consumers. This will involve establishing a consistent, operational framework for those who will be using these directives, that is, regulators, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications and the Commission; guaranteeing legal certainty; encouraging the investment needed to relaunch our economy and make the market dynamic for operators, their consumers and employees; and, finally, developing plenty of high-quality services that are accessible to the majority and fairly priced. It is important that we remain within the terms of the agreement and, unfortunately, recent statements made by certain Member States raise some doubt over their commitment on this matter. I shall support the Commission’s interpretation of the result of our negotiations over Article 19. As a matter of interest, the wording chosen for this article is closely linked to the debate on the mechanisms of Articles 7 and 7a. It would be disappointing if the Council, through non-binding declarations, put across the message that it somehow wanted to have its cake and eat it by denying a fair balance of powers between Member States, BEREC and the Commission, as emerged in the final compromise. Finally, of course, the salient point that led us to conciliation: Amendment 138. I would just like to say that the result obtained was the maximum that Parliament could obtain with the legal basis we had: harmonisation of the internal market. So this result must not be taken lightly, since it offers all users of electronic connections solid protection of their right to privacy, to presumption of innocence and to contradictory procedure, no matter what course of action they face and before any sanctions are adopted. I am also delighted by the Commission’s willingness to assess the situation of net neutrality in Europe and to make the appropriate instruments available to Parliament and the Council by the end of the year, based on the result of these observations. To conclude, I therefore ask everyone to think about the transposition of the package. I am already aware that Parliament, to which this package means a great deal, will make sure that the transposition is undertaken with respect for past agreements. Mr President, I will now listen carefully to my colleagues’ speeches before taking the floor again at the end of the debate. Catherine Trautmann,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, may I express my warmest thanks to my colleagues who have taken part in this debate and say that they have certainly made clear what a perilous and difficult job we have had to complete this telecom package. Ultimately, it was held up by an amendment on which we have resoundingly voted several times in this Parliament, but which was not accepted by the Council. Like others, I believe this to be a basis and not an end. We have not succeeded on this point as we have on others. In the Commissioner’s response, she also stressed the same thing about Article 19. I had hoped we would go much further in implementing a procedure of economic arbitration with regard to European regulators, but of course, we could not achieve everything at once. We tried to be efficient, fair and balanced; we wanted to show that, while the internet and digital society are driven by use and mobility, citizens’ rights should never be ridiculed, scorned or ignored. This is the first time that a text of this kind includes such a reference in its first article, making it a basic principle and linking the internet with the exercise of rights and fundamental freedoms; we believe this makes what we are doing quite distinctive when we legislate with the Council and draft texts with the Commission. Indeed, we think that the information society should be both respectful of citizens’ rights and positive from an economic and social point of view, opening up a new cultural sphere. That is why we anticipate that the market will enable this to happen, that users’ rights will be stated and guaranteed, but that we can also have this extended access and connectivity for all. However, this is also why we now have a considerable job to do in the areas of copyright, net neutrality and radio spectrum. The European Parliament will lend its support. I would like to say what a pleasure it has been to work with my colleagues and how delighted I am that this compromise respects the vote that we so strongly expressed together.

Madam President, Mr Barroso, I might as well say it straight away: you did not convince the French socialists for five years, and you are not succeeding in convincing us now with a project in which you are as generous in word as you are general in purpose. How can you say to us ‘vote for me if you want a Europe that is united in its diversity’, when it is precisely because we want this Europe that we are recommending waiting for the Irish vote so as to vote on your candidacy? Armed with the support of the Member States, you preferred to secure your appointment ahead of time and with fewer risks as regards the number of votes required. You thought that the passage before Parliament would be a mere formality: it is not so, and this is just the beginning, for your response does not meet the expectations of the citizens, who are suffering in the crisis and who have demonstrated their anger towards our institutions through their low turnout. You say that the crisis has changed you and you pose as the great navigator of a united Europe, but you have not been able to guide the Member States towards a truly European recovery plan, and we are still awaiting the concrete and binding measures needed for financial regulation. You claim to have given us guarantees regarding the social agenda, but all you are advocating is a new regulation, not a review of the Posting of Workers Directive. Moreover, you have not made a firm, and above all clear, commitment on a directive protecting public services. You show contempt for the MEPs’ memory of events. We have not forgotten that, over the last five years, social issues have never been at the heart of the proposed solutions, and it is only now that you are agreeing to a social impact study for each piece of European legislation. In a period of unprecedented crisis, which is destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs, everything must be done to ensure that the number of European unemployed workers or working poor does not reach 25 million by 2010. For this we need an industrial policy to be adopted. The citizens need to be set an example of solidarity in order to combat the crisis. Neither in your words nor in your declared ambition for Europe will they find this impetus today. To carry on as before is disastrous, said the philosopher, Walter Benjamin. You still have a very long way to go to win over the socialists and the social democrats. For the sake of political consistency and out of respect for our electorate, we shall not vote for you.

 We Socialists have always denounced the lack of transparency in the negotiations on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and our fight to refuse this agreement has steadily been gaining ground in Parliament, where five parliamentary committees have rejected it. There was therefore only one responsible answer that we could give to citizens regarding the ACTA: for Parliament to reject it in plenary. Despite the numerous delaying tactics by the right, and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in particular, that is exactly what we have done here today and I am delighted. Parliament therefore remains at the forefront of protecting the most stringent European standards on fundamental rights. I wish, in this respect, to acknowledge the work of my predecessor, Kader Arif. The ACTA was the worst possible response to what is a real problem: an agreement that has no effect in beating the scourge of counterfeiting, but, what is more, a potentially dangerous agreement for the fundamental freedoms of European citizens with its massive legal uncertainties. In addition, many other concerns were raised about neutrality, about open access to the Internet, about access to generic drugs or about the protection of geographical indications. Clearly, it did not come up to scratch. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

I voted against the Passenger Name Record (PNR) Agreement between the United States and the EU on the use and transfer of the name records of European passengers. I opposed this agreement as the negotiations in Parliament did not enable a compromise to be found on the necessary guarantees to protect the data of European passengers. Indeed, no provisions have been made to specify the purpose to which the data is put, which has been left too vague, to reduce the retention period of 15 years without, however, making provision for them to be deleted at a later date, and guarantees that the Member States concerned have given their consent if their nationals’ data are transferred to third countries`	.  The list of data to be transferred is also disproportionate leaving a great number of issues open, and does not make any provision for confidential treatment of sensitive data. Finally, it is a very rigid agreement, as judicial redress for Europeans in US courts is very limited, and no provision is made for the presence of the European Parliament and Member States in the review procedures for this agreement. I am not questioning the need to achieve transatlantic cooperation against terrorism, but rather the means chosen to achieve this, which run counter to the high data protection standards supported by the French Socialists.

 I voted for the report of the European Parliament on the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base. On the one hand, this report provides for harmonising the corporate tax base for companies at European level, that is taxable profits, and on the other hand, companies and groups of companies operating within the internal market will be able to add together the profits and losses of their own subsidiaries located in different Member States. The net profit will then be apportioned between these different states on the basis of a mathematical formula and pre-defined factors. The European Parliament spoke with a single voice, thanks to this text, in favour of the progressively obligatory nature of this Common Consolidated Tax Base, a major step forward in terms of adopting a political stance against fiscal dumping and relocations within Europe. An essential element in tackling this phenomenon is still lacking, however, insofar as no agreement has been reached, and that was not the aim of this directive, on the tax rates imposed by each Member State, which remain diverse. It is therefore progress in terms of politics, but is unlikely to be taken up by the Council. It is merely the first brick in the wall of a long struggle to regulate the European market.

 The European Parliament has been consulted on the reform of the system of taxation of energy products and electricity. While I voted in favour of Ms Lulling’s report, I believe that if it is to be understood and accepted by citizens, this change should take place gradually, bearing in mind the current socio-economic situation. Today, the cost of fuel is already a major expense for family incomes, and some families have consequently started to change their consumer habits. That is why I am opposed to the ‘proportionality’ principle between the different threshold levels applicable to each type of energy, which is likely to cause a very great increase in the cost of diesel, a widely-used fuel in France. Europe’s ecological objectives must not be achieved at the expense of the objectives of employment, competitiveness, and protection of consumers’ purchasing power, but must go hand in hand with these. Let us hope that the Council, the sole decision maker in fiscal matters, will listen to this message from the MEPs. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 At the end of 2011, the procedure for drawing up the 2012 budget was marked by deep rifts between Parliament and the Council concerning the financing of ITER, the thermonuclear fusion research project based at Cadarache in the Bouches-du-Rhône. EUR 750 million of cost overruns compared with the initial estimates had to be found for 2012 and only EUR 100 million had been agreed by the end of 2011. A compromise therefore had to be found for the remaining EUR 650 million. After long negotiations with the Council, Parliament succeeded in getting this money released by increasing the financial ceiling of the budget heading concerned, while the Council initially envisaged financing solely through the redeployment of funds from the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development. The additional financing needed for the ITER project in 2012 will therefore be available without the other research programmes being compromised. Along with all the Members of the European Parliament, I will nonetheless remain vigilant as to the sources of financing that will be mobilised in 2013 to cover the overrun that has already been announced. It is our duty to ensure that the ITER project will not be financed to the detriment of other priority policies of the EU 2020 strategy. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 While the debates on the future of the post-2014 cohesion policy have just begun in the European Parliament, which has been granted power of codecision on this matter under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament wanted to point out the specific nature of the outermost regions (ORs) – including the French overseas departments and territories – and the need to grant them adequate resources for their economic and social development. On account of their remoteness, their insularity and their extreme climatic conditions, these territories do actually need differential treatment, both for the viability of local agricultural and industrial production and for the successful implementation of the various EU programmes and remits. As such, the Commission’s proposal to halve the budget allocated to offset the additional costs on these territories is highly regrettable. What is more, I had proposed amendments on this subject in the opinion that the Committee on Budgets issued on the Teixeira report, and I had pointed out the need to include the accession of Mayotte to OR status in the 2014-2020 financial forecasts for these regions. In 2014, Mayotte will actually become the fifth outermost French territory recognised by the European Union. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 After 18 long months of negotiations with the Council, Parliament has finally been able to agree to the new regulation on over-the-counter derivatives. Traders are now required to clear these contracts through central counterparties and to report all derivatives, even those not negotiated over the counter. Moreover, the powers of intervention of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) have been increased in terms of settling disputes between national regulators. These decisions were considered essential in order to improve the transparency of the financial markets, given that derivatives had a large part to play in aggravating the volatility of the markets during the 2008 crisis. However, this is only a first step in regulating the financial sector: others, which Parliament could not support because of the Council’s opposition, will have to be examined in the future, in particular, enhancing the role of ESMA.

 While the debates on the general budget for the European Union for 2013 are already showing signs of becoming strained between Parliament and the Council, we, the MEPs, are in the process of drawing up the next operational budget for our institution. Aware of certain budgetary constraints, we have evaluated the change in our funding requirements at + 1.9% in comparison with 2012, an increase below the level of inflation. Some budget lines will be subject to freezing in order to achieve this target, such as Members’ allowances, transport costs, etc. Other areas will also need to be studied closely in order to avoid any overspending: this is the case for costs relating to building maintenance or the establishment of the House of European History. Over the course of the year, we will also need to be more vigilant about some additional necessary loans, such as those relating to the accession of Croatia, which have still not been included in the budget’s provisions. Parliament must be exemplary in establishing its budget to ensure that it has the means to fully guarantee its democratically received powers while controlling its spending within reasonable limits.

 Every year, the European Commission publishes a report on the state of gender equality in Europe. Unfortunately, the same findings recur every year: gender stereotyping, ancestral taboos and an outdated view of the division of roles between women and men persist, preventing any improvement in the circumstances of women in the European Union. In 2011, the crisis helped make the situation worse, since, in affecting women more severely than men, it undermined their economic independence. Employment, access to positions of political and economic responsibility, freedom and sexual health: all issues that still require a continuous struggle in order to achieve genuine gender equality. This also has to be a daily struggle, in everyday life as well as in the European Parliament, where, at every opportunity, almost one third of Members regrettably call into question the issue of access to contraception and abortion.

 By defining the general guidelines for the preparation of the 2013 budget, Parliament wanted to focus mainly on support for jobs (especially for young people) and SMEs. These priorities bear a strange resemblance to the priorities Parliament defined for the 2012 budget. Now, the difficulties of the latest budget negotiations are already putting in doubt the result of the discussions that are soon to take place on the drafting of the 2013 budget. Are the budget guidelines merely Parliament’s pious hopes? I fear so, as the negotiations have followed the same tragic route for two years: the draft budget from the Commission, supported by Parliament, undergoes cuts by the Council, which is more interested in reducing its contribution to the EU budget than in the budget’s added-value. This fool’s game has been played since Parliament failed to use its new powers of budgetary codecision to oppose the Council’s sterile wishes in 2010. 2012 will also be the year when the 2014-2020 financial framework is drafted. It will be difficult to prevent the Council’s short-term ‘in times of crisis’ vision from being applied to the definition of the ‘post-crisis’ financial perspectives. We must, however, support an ambitious position, for a Europe in line with the expectations of Europeans. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Mr President, we should, of course, be glad that the Member States have finally reached an agreement to ensure the immediate future of the European food aid programme for the most deprived citizens. This agreement was vital for millions of Europeans who have already been given a rough ride because of the crisis but it is far, far from enough. In fact, it is conditional upon the withdrawal of the Food Aid Programme in 2014, and on the will of the German Chancellor, a will that unfortunately is not upset, that Europe is no longer funding any social policy of this type beyond that date. We are Europe. We have core values and shared ideals that we support: peace, prosperity, of course, but also solidarity and the right to dignity, given that dignity is the opposite of humiliation … (The President asked the speaker to slow down) Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

The decision taken under the French Presidency to do away with quotas risked leaving milk producers without any safeguards in the case of market disturbances. We therefore welcome the ‘milk package’ proposal as a first step in the right direction. It was necessary to strengthen producers’ negotiating power in relation to the private processing industry by encouraging them to group together and promoting the use of contracts, which are only used for half of all production. My Socialist colleagues, especially Stéphane Le Foll, helped to improve the proposal by ensuring the future of milk production in vulnerable regions where cheeses with protected designations are made. There is still a great deal to do, however. In particular, it will be essential to shift the balance back towards livestock farming and provide other market tools in order to prevent any further crises in the milk sector. We must take the opportunity presented by the CAP reform to supplement this mechanism so as to guarantee farmers’ income and once again put them back where they belong at the heart of the food supply chain and food safety in Europe.

 Mr Fisas Ayxela’s report gave Parliament the opportunity to support the European Commission’s communication of 18 January 2011 on developing the European dimension in sport, this being the Commission’s first policy document on this subject since it became a Community responsibility. While I welcome the report’s commitment to reminding us of the key values that playing sport can convey and suggesting the type of actions that should reflect the Community added value in this field, I wonder about the EU’s current ability to effectively assume this responsibility. With only EUR 4 million specifically dedicated to sport each year (in the form of a ‘preparatory action’, in other words, a temporary action), the Union does not have the resources to effectively combat doping, to support sport for people with disabilities, to promote the development of a ‘European identity’ through sport, etc., an issue that must be addressed in the months ahead, when Member States are being asked to establish the EU budgetary framework for 2014-2020.

 Could Mr Gauzès specify the nature of the commitments made by Renault to Mr Bertrand, the relevant minister, which appear to him to be serious? Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, led by my conscience and my sense of responsibility, I will vote against the French Government’s application for aid on behalf of Renault, and I will do so as an individual. Because, unlike other groups, Renault refused to take account of the situation of former, older, workers laid off in 2009 and soon left with nothing following the entry into force of the reform of the pension system. Because, with profits of more than EUR 3 billion in 2010, the Renault Group exploits the full potentialities of globalisation. Because I think that, at a time when everyone is being urged to tighten their belts, signing a blank cheque for EUR 24.5 million with no quid pro quo
 is outrageous. Because, finally, Commissioner, the training and support measures presented by the applicants as active back-to-work measures, the only ones eligible for funding under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) are, in fact, disconnected from any resumption-of-activity logic. This is not about salving our consciences by creating the illusion that we are supporting European industry. In the end, what counts is that we support the interests of the workers in the industry and the associated jobs. This is a case in which the EGF is being derailed, and we must draw the necessary conclusions in order to adapt it. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, we wish to table an oral amendment. After contact was made on numerous occasions, the management of Renault and the French Government have so far refused to take into account the situation of company workers who, in 2009, agreed to leave the company and are affected by the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) application and who, since then, have seen their rights eroded and their income reduced through the application of the reform of the French pension system. The amendment is as follows: Paragraph 2a: calls on Renault and the French Government to commit themselves formally to take the necessary legal and financial measures to restore all rights and pension benefits, while granting work exemption under equivalent conditions to workers whose pension benefits were affected by reforms having entered into force since their dismissal.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome the strengthening of the mandate for the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) as proposed in this report, and I would like to support this great need to deepen integration of maritime safety by giving the example of transnational cooperation in the English Channel, which is in decline. After 10 years of Franco-British cofinancing of an emergency tow vessel, the UK Government has now decided to stop funding the vessel as part of its cutbacks, thereby reducing the safety of that sea crossing, one of the busiest in the world, which is being hit hard by the impact of privatising these services and the lack of a shared vision. It is therefore vital that the national authorities responsible for transposing this legislation – primarily the national coastguard services – act in unison in order to guarantee the efficiency and durability of transnational actions. I therefore believe it is of utmost importance for EMSA to show concern for safety in the English Channel and coordinate the action taken by Member States in that area. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this report because the European Union must increase aid for its regions, particularly rural ones, in order to encourage economic recovery. We must therefore support the Commission’s proposal to temporarily increase the Union’s maximum cofinancing rate for EAFRD (European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development) programmes in struggling States that receive support from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (euro area) or the balance of payments facility for non-euro area Member States. The Commission’s proposal is nonetheless paradoxical since, at the same time, it claims to be in favour of the Franco-German proposal to suspend the payment of regional funds to struggling States in order to force them to put their public accounts in order. Penalising those States by suspending cohesion policy funds, while offering increased support for EAFRD programmes, amounts to arbitrary discrimination against non-agricultural areas. If it is to recover from the economic crisis, the European Union must lend its support to all of those regions that are struggling. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find it hard to celebrate the fact that we have reached an agreement with the Council on financing the extra cost of ITER. The point of these discussions (which muddied the negotiations on the budget) was not simply to find a solution for ITER. The main issue was, in fact, to deal with the underfunding of the European Union budget, which has become a structural problem to the extent that we are now in a position of questioning whether or not the EU has the capacity to honour its international commitments. The ITER project is yet another illustration of the fact that the EU budget is not adequate to meet either the EU’s ambitions or our strategies. The reason that ITER has become, and will continue to be, one of the greatest sources of ongoing tension between Parliament and the Council is that Member States are demanding ever more from the European Union on the project, but are not willing to bear the financial consequences. By tinkering around the edges, and proposing short term solutions for funding these increasingly costly major projects, Member States are jeopardising the Union’s capacity, from 2013 onwards, to afford the tasks for which it is responsible. For the period 2014 to 2020, by deciding to remove the ITER and GMES projects from the next financial framework, even though they were both established as research and development projects by a majority vote, the Commission is admitting that it is actually unable to guarantee that the financial resources will be there to meet our responsibilities. This is a serious admission of failure and incapacity. The Union does not have the wherewithal to abide by its international commitments, and yet research, innovation and energy are among the major aims of the 2020 strategy, along with employment, sustainable development and growth. Pitting these different priorities against each other is not the way to … (The President cut off the speaker) Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, this 2012 budget is the Council budget, to which the European Parliament has added a little spiritual something by ensuring the inclusion of a few priorities, but priorities in the form of commitment appropriations, which, Commissioner, will exacerbate the problem of amounts outstanding. The countercyclical development and growth targets have again been severely obstructed in the EU budget for 2012. Firstly, because competition between programmes, which is the consequence of cutting costs willy-nilly, has been given priority at the expense of structuring measures that would allow us to take an active role in overcoming the crisis. Secondly, because Member States are refusing to honour payments in a timely manner – despite being legally required to do so – and are therefore deterring project leaders from developing structural initiatives. Lastly, because the Council has refused to increase, among other things, the funding for financial supervisory authorities and to further the creation of a proper fund to manage farming crises, thereby turning a blind eye to the context in which this budget will have to be implemented. The Member States are therefore imposing austerity measures on the European Union, just as they have done for their own citizens. The current negotiations on this budget are merely the precursor to the impending negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework. It will be hard to resolve the apparent lack of confidence between the institutions, resulting, in particular, from the Council’s decision to question the figures provided by the Commission, which I am sure you appreciated, Commissioner, and the failure to comply with decisions that apply to both branches of the budgetary authority. Yet there are instruments in place for that purpose – I am referring to new own resources, which could put an end to the inevitable deadlock created by the antagonism between net contributors and net beneficiaries. There is now no time to waste. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 I voted for Ms Berès’s resolution as it is vitally important for the emergence of European economic governance to go hand in hand with greater democratic scrutiny. In order to deal with the major changes that will have to take place if it is to emerge from the crisis, the EU must ensure the strong democratic legitimacy of its decisions. This legitimacy can only be guaranteed with the European Parliament’s support and involvement in the annual drafting of the EU’s main economic policy guidelines. In particular, it is essential for Parliament to participate in the European Semester procedure, during which each of the 27 draft national budgets is assessed by the European Commission. Following this procedure, Parliament should have the chance to amend the macro-economic policy guidelines proposed to Member States. This democratic development also requires enhanced dialogue with the national parliaments and the social partners in order to support European economic policy coherence and guarantee that the EU 2020 objectives are taken into account. Finally, it is vital that the Treaties be revised only with the agreement and, where necessary, the involvement, of Parliament. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 The maritime area is changing. There are numerous challenges in this area, starting with the need for shared use. In particular, this means developing fishery-related jobs, which must be an objective of the common fisheries policy; strengthening maritime freight; harnessing the extraordinary industrial potential of offshore wind parks; and developing tourism activities. There can be no policy without a budget; we therefore need to ensure that the integrated maritime policy has its place in the future multiannual financial framework. However, I would say that, if this policy is to be a success, it is vital to get the Member States well and truly on board. This policy requires cross-sectoral but also transnational cooperation. However, in the Channel, transnational cooperation is waning. After 10 years of cofinancing an emergency tow vessel with France, the UK Government has now decided, as part of its cutbacks, to privatise its coastguard service, thereby reducing the safety of that sea crossing, one of the busiest in the world, which is being hit hard by the lack of a shared vision. An integrated maritime policy at European level must therefore be based on a synergy between national maritime policies, a synergy enhanced by a European ambition, which is itself equipped with adequate financial resources.

 I voted in favour of the report on illegal fishing at the global level, because its aim is beyond dispute. Illegal fishing unfairly competes with legal fishing and also often goes hand in hand with serious social conditions. There is no international framework today in which to share common standards. It is therefore vital for the European Union to become a proactive force in the bodies to which it belongs. During the forthcoming debates on the common fisheries policy, I will, however, be keeping a close eye on the issue of sanctions, which is raised in this report. Indeed, the resolution recommends withdrawing European subsidies for those who breach the rules. This proposal will need to be discussed with local players before it is taken any further. The entry into force of the point-based licence is also welcomed; I am unable to support this given the state of the current implementing arrangements. Furthermore, and in view of the UK Government’s recent decision to stop subsidising safety in the Channel, I made sure that it was spelt out in the report that the Union needs to improve its own operations, in particular, by creating a European coastguard, so as to ensure that our actions are more coordinated and effective.

 The report on the European platform against poverty and social exclusion, submitted by Frédéric Daerden, highlights a depressing paradox: whilst 116 million Europeans are threatened with poverty and 42 million of them are experiencing extreme material deprivation, the EU 2020 strategy only sets a target of 20 million in terms of reducing the number of people threatened by poverty. Is this an acknowledgement of weakness or an admission of the abandonment of the principle of solidarity, one of the Union’s founding values? Unfortunately, it can be seen in this way, given the ‘solution’ for the Food Distribution Programme for the Most Deprived Persons of the Community: it will be safeguarded for 2012 and 2013, but with unacceptable conditions, namely, the definitive scrapping of this programme and the abandonment of any EU-level social policy from 2014. This proposal is a provocation at a time when citizens are sorely affected by the crisis and austerity plans. It threatens to reinforce the impression of economic, social and moral regression. This is why, out of respect for the idea of a progressive, supportive Europe, we must continue to rally round this programme: for my part, I shall be paying particular attention during the negotiations on the financial perspectives after 2013.

 Mr President, for the second year running we are in a no-win situation, as the Commission – correct me if I am wrong, Commissioner – has produced a budget proposal that will barely be enough to implement the programmes we have undertaken, and will certainly not develop them or take on board the powers of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Council is clinging to its austerity dogma, and arbitrarily deciding on cuts to programmes that are extremely important in the light of the economic and social climate. Our proposal seeks to mobilise the EU budget to work towards the Europe 2020 strategy goals, and places the emphasis on programmes for research, employment, competitiveness, cohesion and public investment. It is a cohesive position, and one which we owe to the strong commitment of our rapporteur, Ms Balzani. We owe her our thanks for this. The EU budget is underfunded, due to the squeeze by Member States whose only goals are austerity, reducing public expenditure, punishing the regions – I am referring to macroeconomic conditionality – and punishing citizens, starting with the most deprived among them. I am referring to the deplorably sad fate that the Council intends to mete out to the European food aid scheme for the most deprived. If we take an honest look at the situation, at present we have no own resources, no Eurobonds, a predominantly intergovernmental method, a budget that is derisory, as this discussion also seems to be, considering the stakes at play in the European Summit and the billions that Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy are waving about to reassure the financial markets.

 I abstained on this resolution because, as the Commission has confirmed to us, referral to the Court of Justice of the European Union would block the parliamentary consent procedure, when the period of validity of the Protocol to the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco is due to expire at the end of February. In order to prevent Parliament, which unfortunately has been consulted far too late, from having its decision-making powers blocked, I chose to abstain by taking the view that the debate should focus not on this resolution but on the Protocol. Furthermore, since the fishermen are already fishing off the Moroccan coast, Parliament’s vote will only have a retroactive effect. If we want to obtain proper guarantees from the Commission and the Moroccan Government regarding the benefits of these activities for all the populations concerned and regarding the economic importance that they represent for the EU, then it is on the future agreement, which will replace the previous agreement from February onwards, that we will have to focus all our efforts. I am confident that the Commission will be able to negotiate a new agreement that lives up to expectations and that it will involve Parliament, so that it is not in danger of having its powers blocked again.

 Along with the majority of members in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I voted against four of the six reports from the economic governance package. I voted in favour of the report on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances and abstained on the report on the enforcement measures to correct macroeconomic imbalances. Most of the new measures, which follow multiple negotiations conducted in Brussels, merely impose austerity on citizens without taking account of the economic recovery that we need if we are to get back on the path to growth and employment. The Ferreira report was alone in offering persuasive solutions in this area. Indeed, this report provides for the guaranteed protection of social rights and the introduction of a very wide range of economic indicators which allow the situation in each country to be properly taken into account. It also advocates a symmetrical approach, pointing the finger at those Member States with huge trade surpluses as being responsible for developing macroeconomic imbalances. I abstained on the Haglund report, although I do not agree with its punitive content, as it had to be adopted if the measures advocated in the Ferreira report were to be implemented.

 Mr President, the European Council of Ministers for Agriculture failed to oppose a reduction of 75% in food aid to the most deprived. Seventy-five per cent! What we see on the ground is that the blocking of this programme by a minority of Member States arouses outrage, incomprehension and exasperation among members of the public, charities and their volunteers and, of course, beneficiaries. This situation undermines the credibility and image of the Union. Our citizens are aware that Europe is devoting a great deal of energy and resources to reassuring the markets, as demonstrated in the speech given by Mr Barroso this morning, and that it is mobilising less and less to come to the aid of the populations hardest hit by the crisis. That gives rise to a feeling of injustice and mistrust of the European institutions, which is potentially explosive, socially and democratically. Commissioner, as you said, Parliament has taken its responsibilities seriously, as has the Commission. It is now up to the Member States, including France, whose leaders are shedding crocodile tears over this programme, to reach agreement. If they so wish – as you said, Commissioner, it is matter of political will – on Monday this matter will be closed in the Council of Ministers for Employment and Social Affairs. It should never have been opened out of solidarity and respect for the beneficiaries. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy market integrity and transparency. The regulation lays down new rules that are designed to stop abusive practices in the wholesale energy markets, among other means by giving more powers to monitor and impose penalties to the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), which was set up in 2009. Considering that at present one of the main objectives of EU energy policy is to complete the establishment of the internal gas and electricity market, and that research and investment are concentrating on developing trans-European energy networks, it is extremely important for this new market to be governed by rules that will protect consumers. We can also expect energy trading between Member States to increase over the next few years. The research currently being done in the North Sea on creating a network capable of transporting offshore wind energy is just one example of what is needed for the future. It will therefore be beneficial to provide an appropriate legislative framework for this new market, so that it can develop properly and expand within a clearly defined legal framework.

 I voted in favour of the review of the Regulation on the Frontex Agency because it was vital to clarify its role and responsibilities while ensuring that it respects migrants’ fundamental rights when carrying out its operations. The need for this review has become even more obvious in the light of the Arab revolutions and the migratory movements that have followed. I therefore welcome several of the proposed amendments, such as the establishment of a consultative forum, which will exercise greater control over Frontex’s activities, and the requirement for the agency to undertake rescue at sea during humanitarian emergencies, or face the suspension of its operations. The possibility that the agency will not have to depend any more on the Member States, by acquiring its equipment itself, together with the increased information given to Parliament, are amendments that will help to clarify the link between Frontex and political decisions. One aspect that has particularly caught my attention is the creation, thanks to this regulation, of the status of European border guards. This development, which is only terminological at present, is an innovation that may, we hope, have a bearing on other groups of professionals requiring the same coordination, such as the coastguards of the various Member States, for example.

 I voted in favour of the report by the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis, as drafted by my colleague, Pervenche Berès, as it proposes ambitious yet practical solutions to help the EU come out of the financial, economic and social crisis from which European citizens are suffering on a daily basis. It is only by implementing Europe-wide solutions, such as issuing Eurobonds, which will enable more effective management of sovereign debt, greater investment in education, research and vocational education and the establishment of sound, effective economic governance, that Europe will be able to come out of this crisis for good. In its report by the Special Committee on Policy Challenges of 8 June 2011, Parliament called for EU budget resources to match the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. However, this message was regrettably not repeated in the final version of the Crisis Committee’s report. If we are to implement the Europe 2020 strategy, boost Europe’s economy and promote employment, we will certainly need a substantial increase in the EU budget over the next few years.

 Mr President, I should like to thank our rapporteur and praise the quality of the draft text of this mandate for the trialogue, which stresses the urgency of finally mobilising the annual budgets for the benefit of the Europe 2020 strategy and in a way that is consistent with the European semester approach. Nevertheless, the negotiations promise to be difficult, since the Commission’s guiding principle is to satisfy, by presenting a squeezed budget, the austerity requirements imposed by the Member States, while ignoring citizens’ needs. In this respect, the fate awaiting the food aid programmes targeting the most impoverished populations is symptomatic. Like many of my fellow Members, Commissioner, I was informed by the press that the European Commission is planning to drastically cut funding for the Most Deprived Persons (MDP) programme. Thus, it would be divided by four, from 500 million this year to only 113 million next year. The Union currently spends EUR 1 per capita and per year to defend the fundamental principle of these citizens’ right to food, in a rationale of European solidarity. The scrapping of this symbolic euro on the altar of national self-interests and budgetary austerity illustrates Europe’s moral and political failure. It is often said that the level of development of a human society can be measured by how it cares for its most vulnerable and deprived members. To cite technical and legal difficulties as an excuse for dismantling this food aid programme is disastrous not only for the people concerned but also for Europe’s credibility and image. The Commission is making fools of MEPs and the citizens they represent by proposing amounts in April and then dividing them by four two months later. Commissioner, I hope that you will change your mind on this particular decision, and that you will not remain deaf to the political objectives and budgetary intentions thereof which are expressed in this mandate for the trialogue.

 I voted in favour of this report on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste to send a clear message to the Member States: polluters must be held responsible for their waste. Indeed, whether it is a question of waste resulting from activities relating to the production of electricity or activities in other areas such as medicine, research and industry, the export of radioactive waste to third countries is an irresponsible practice that has been condemned by Parliament in adopting this report. Despite the success of this vote, given the cross-border implications for the safety and health of European citizens, I regret the minor role that Parliament has been given in nuclear matters as it has only a consultative role in this matter. Thanks to an amendment brought by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, this report underlines the need to find a new legal basis for legislation in nuclear matters in order for the interests of European citizens to be better represented on issues that are of such direct concern to them.

 Mr President, the debate on the European Union’s financial perspective raises questions about the European project, its scope and its ambition. This report is laudable because it seeks to mobilise the Union’s budgetary resources in order to comply with the Europe 2020 strategy. This puts it at odds with the narrow vision of most Member States. Whereas Member States see Europe in terms of their financial contribution, which they want to see reduced, and the financial returns, which they want to see increased, this report argues in favour of strong and integrated Community policies, be they long-established policies or new competences under the Treaty of Lisbon. Consequently, this own-initiative report by Parliament should form the basis for future discussions, even if, in my view, it does err on the side of consensus and caution. It is true that a 5% increase in the European budget would be better than the Member States’ budgetary plans for 2012. However, the crux of the matter – and probably the stumbling block – will be agreeing a figure that tallies with the policies described in the report. We are aware of the downsides of austerity policies: how they affect employment and have left growing numbers of citizens despairing. We have a responsibility to finance countercyclical policies, not least through a strong cohesion policy, Mr Pieper, which promotes public investment and employment in all European regions. I would like to stress the importance of creating an intermediate regions category to ensure that the allocation of Structural Funds accurately reflects economic and social realities in the regions. Let me conclude by saying that we need to impose a tax on financial speculation, which would increase our citizens’ support for a well-financed Europe. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 With the adoption of the Garriga report on the political and budgetary challenges facing the European Union after 2013, Parliament is anticipating, much too timidly in my view, the debate to come on the future financial prospects of the Union. This report reiterates its opposition to pitting against each other the different policies that fall within EU competence and insists on the need to mobilise sufficient funds, consistent with the EU 2020 strategy. It sends a clear message to Member States: we intend to support strong integrated policies and to do this by increasing the budget by at least 5%. Furthermore, in a context where citizens are subjected to austerity, we must maintain a strong cohesion policy. That is what we propose in this report, with support for the plan to create an intermediate category of regions, which will enable a distribution of Structural Funds that is more in accordance with the real economic and social situations of our territories. Finally, the Union must grant itself financial resources that match its ambitions. We have therefore reiterated our desire to introduce a tax on financial transactions, a project which is widely supported by the public and which would encourage greater support on their part for the European project.

 This resolution was adopted following the proposal by the Commission aimed at opening the negotiations on renewing the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Mauritania. Voting in favour of a resolution is unfortunately the only thing Parliament can do to be heard in the negotiations of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA). At present, Parliament can only have its say once the negotiations have ended, which leaves it no other option than to either approve these agreements or reject their ratification, thus leaving it very little room for manoeuvre. Now, the Treaties stipulate that Parliament be ‘immediately and fully informed at all stages of the procedure’. Hence, it is essential and legitimate that we ask to be associated with the European Commission and Council during these negotiations. This issue is not new and raises regular questioning of the European Commission by the members of the Committee on Fisheries. It is regrettable that we are not able to make binding our opinion on our priorities relating to the provision of European funds to the countries concerned, in spite of the fact that Parliament has the power to exercise financial control.

The adoption of a Parliament resolution on the European fisheries sector crisis due to the rise in oil prices is an opportunity for me to remind you how urgent it is for us to come to the aid of fishermen. In a context where recruitment is becoming more and more difficult, and where the practices that fishermen must adopt continue to become ever more restrictive, the increase in fuel prices makes conditions even more difficult in this crisis-hit sector. The substantial increase in oil prices is having a strong impact on fishermen’s operational costs, and this caused their revenue to fall between 2008 and 2010. As the elected representative of a port town, it is all the more incumbent on me to call on the Commission to authorise an increase in the ceiling of the de minimis
 aid. This measure would relieve the pressure on fishermen, thereby enabling them to make a decent living from their work without hindering the replenishment of stocks. The upcoming reform of the common fisheries policy will have to gain the support of fishermen. To show them today that the European Union is alert to their needs would be a good start.

 Following recent events which have highlighted the potential abuses of lobbying, it has appeared all the more necessary to increase transparency regarding the work of interest groups at the European institutions. The merging of the lists of lobbyists registered at the Parliament and the Commission represents a first step towards compiling an exhaustive register of the lobbies active in Brussels and, subsequently, towards greater citizen access to democratic checks and balances in the decision-making process. I have, however, fought to prevent the offices representing local authorities at the European institutions from being affected by this measure. Indeed, I consider these structures to be the direct product of democratically-elected bodies (town, departmental, regional councils, etc.). They represent the general interest, and should therefore be distinguished from lobbyists who defend individual interests. Furthermore, I hope that this register will develop to become mandatory one day, and include all lobbyists who are active at the European institutions. The notion of transparency is crucial to European Union policy and it must be extended to cover all interest groups that participate in its operation. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, EU fishermen are, as we know, confronted with three major problems: firstly, the very complex, unpopular quota system has forced them to adopt very restrictive practices. Secondly, the lack of training opportunities and the profession’s perceived loss of prestige are causing significant recruitment problems. Thirdly, and this is the issue we are discussing today, the rise in oil prices is making operating conditions in this crisis-hit sector even more difficult. Between 2008 and 2010, French fishermen, for example, lost EUR 100-200 in income per week as a result of fluctuating oil prices, even though their turnover remained the same. As an elected representative from a port town, I strongly support my fellow Members in demanding that the Commission authorise an increase in the de minimis
 aid ceilings. This measure would relieve the pressure on fishermen, thereby enabling them to make a decent living from their work. However, contrary to what has also been said, it would not affect the replenishment of stocks. The future reform of the common fisheries policy will have to seek the support of fishermen. To show them today, on Europe Day in particular, that the European Union is alert to their needs would already be a good start, Commissioner. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European food aid programme for the most deprived persons in the EU was urgently introduced during the exceptionally cold winter of 1986, then enshrined the following year in the common agricultural policy. This programme has become vital for 13 million Europeans who have little job security. It eases the strain on their food budget through distributions by charities and social services, and adds up to a mere EUR 1 per European per year in aid. Together with the Federation of Food Banks, Secours populaire
, the Red Cross and Restos du Coeur
 in France, I am concerned about the future of this programme after the European Court of Justice called into question its funding within the framework of the CAP. Our Parliament has often emphasised the fundamental nature of the right to food. Our institutions made 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. To cite legal ambiguity as an excuse for dismantling, as some Member States are trying to do, a food aid programme that has proved its worth would be disastrous not only for the people concerned but also for Europe’s credibility and image. That is why I call on the Commission to take the political measures necessary to safeguard, preserve and strengthen that programme. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 The parliamentary resolution on the lessons to be drawn from the nuclear accident in Japan contained some very positive points with regard to the safety of power plants, recommending, for example, ‘stress tests’ carried out in a coordinated manner at EU level by independent bodies working in accordance with the most exacting standards and completely transparently. Furthermore, like everyone else in the French socialist delegation, I supported the amendments in favour of a carefully planned and prepared phasing-out of nuclear power, reflecting the fight against global warming. That phasing-out of nuclear power will have to go hand in hand with increased investment in research and innovation, in order to reduce our energy dependence and increase the number of renewable forms of energy in the energy mix of the EU Member States. I did, however, vote against the motion as a whole, because it was merely a juxtaposition of viewpoints forming an inconsistent motion. After such a disastrous event as Fukushima, the question of the future of a sector as sensitive as nuclear energy requires more than a hastily put together resolution. We will now have to take the time necessary to organise a genuinely constructive debate, addressing all of the associated issues while enabling everyone to voice his or her opinion.

 I voted in favour of this report on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in support of the food industry employees (UNILEVER) in the Czech Republic. I would stress, however, that there is an urgent need to review the regulation of that fund as soon as possible. To this end, during the vote I co-signed and secured the adoption of an amendment specifying that it is detrimental for the regulation not to require an investigation into the financial health, possible tax evasion or state aid situation of multinationals which benefit from the intervention of the EGF. At a time when the European Union is struggling to finance its objectives and is obliged to choose between policies of equally high priority, the Community budget cannot afford to fund the market entry and relocation strategies of large multinational companies whose sole intention is to increase their profits. This must be taken into account in the forthcoming regulation, without prejudicing redundant workers by compromising their access to the EGF. Estelle Grelier,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their committed and constructive participation in the work done by the Committee on Fisheries on this report on transitional technical measures. The report has aroused lively debate, given the huge significance of the technical measures, as they will influence the way fishermen and the sector as a whole do their work, by setting out the methods fishermen may use to catch fish in the zones covered by this regulation, with a view to protecting juveniles and restoring stocks: an aim shared by all, and by fishermen in particular. The subject of this report is sensitive and controversial, as demonstrated by the difficulties the Commission has come up against since 2008 in trying to reach an agreement with the Council on the future of these measures. This was when only those two institutions were involved in the procedure. At present, technical measures are governed by an old regulation that was amended by a succession of transitional measures and then renewed until 30 June 2011 as no agreement was reached with the Council on the Commission’s 2008 proposal for a new regulation, which was aimed at simplifying and clarifying the existing legislation to ensure the rules were implemented more effectively and to cater for the fisheries’ regional features. Today, as the new deadline approaches the situation is radically different. Since the Treaty of Lisbon, for the most part the subject of fisheries now falls under the ordinary legislative procedure, whereby Parliament has an important part to play as co-legislator. It fully intends to play its part by bringing the fishermen’s points of view and those of EU policy-makers closer together. As an elected representative from a port town, I am always struck by how the fishing sector mistrusts and sees itself as remote from the common fisheries policy (CFP), whereas farmers for example clearly feel themselves to be more a part of the common agricultural policy. Added to this, the fishing sector is in crisis. There is growing dissatisfaction. The real challenge is the balance that must be found between the sector’s economic stability and hence the guarantee of decent incomes for fishermen and the sustainability and replenishment of fish stocks. Finally, the expiration of the regulation comes at a time when talks on the reform of the common fisheries policy are starting. This reform must adopt a bold framework and must get the fishing community, consumers and citizens on board. It must involve the whole sector in the scientific analyses that form the basis for the quotas and hence the sector’s level of activity. This new framework presupposes that the Commission will draw up a concrete proposal on the future technical measures, an effort which at present both it and the Council appear to have been saving themselves. The new proposal must make provision to ensure that the technical measures are in keeping with real experience on the ground, through consultation with those working in the sector. It must also be in keeping with the new regulation and the framework of the new CFP, especially on the subject of regional variations in measures. It must ensure that the division of jurisdiction between the Commission and Member States is clearly defined, a factor which will aid understanding and ownership of this EU policy. In the light of this background and these issues, I propose that we agree to the Commission’s request for an extension until 31 December 2012, without substantially changing the current technical measures except for the addition regarding the permissible mesh size for boarfish. However, I realise that this proposal is a form of concession to the Commission and that there are a lot of questions being asked and a strong demand for change in the sector, which is disappointed that this important project has been postponed. I am therefore adding a twofold demand to our approval: a request for an impact assessment on the technical measures currently in force, which is vital if we are to adapt them effectively, and a request for genuine consultation with all of the parties involved, especially fishermen themselves, in drawing up the new regulation. To conclude, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the Commission’s new proposal should be made within a reasonable timescale for a new regulation to come into force on 1 January 2013, which is when the new CFP comes into force. It is vital that the Commission begin work immediately on this new proposal. It would be unreasonable to allow a further extension after this new 18-month extension period for the current regulation. The technical measures to which my report relates are transitional and have only been approved as such. Estelle Grelier,

 Mr President, I will do my best to speak more slowly – I promise.  (FR)
 Mr President, I would like to thank my fellow Members for their generally favourable comments on this report, which also echo the debates that took place during the meetings in the Committee on Fisheries. I share the Commissioner’s standpoint on accepting the amendment specifying the mesh size for boarfish nets and on not agreeing to any specific requests for amendments to certain technical measures, on the grounds that they are not supported by any impact assessments for the vessels and the ecosystems concerned, or because the Member States have not sent the necessary scientific data. These measures are all interconnected and have not been evaluated. I would like to stress, as previous speakers have done this evening, the urgency for the Commission to carry out an evaluation of the current measures as quickly as possible and on the basis of this evaluation to draw up a new proposal that can be dealt with at the same time as the reform of the common fisheries policy, rather than after it. I wanted to draw your attention to this point, Commissioner, and I note your readiness to speed up the drafting of the proposal. To conclude, I must mention once again the importance of joint work between the EU institutions and the fisheries sector on gathering and sharing the scientific data. I believe this is a necessary basis for a new, fair and collaborative common fisheries policy which has sufficient resources – and that is an important point – and which reconciles the economic necessities and the sustainability of the sector in the interests of all: the fishing community, consumers and citizens.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Balzani, for the consistency of her draft resolution on the general guidelines for the 2012 budget. This resolution sends a clear political message. It is because it is fully aware of the budgetary constraints affecting the European Union that Parliament is today calling for the adoption of a 2012 budget that can respond to the political, economic and social challenges we currently face. At a time when the sole topic of discussion among the Member States is the implementation of additional austerity measures, Parliament, at least on this side of the House, intends to demonstrate its commitment to the thousands of workers who, today, are marching through the streets of Brussels to show their rejection of these economically questionable and socially unjust measures, the result of which will be a further increase in structural unemployment in Europe. The fact that the European budget is being aligned with the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy, in a clear way for the first time in 2012, means that employment and growth can be put back at the heart of European policies, which I would point out are our priorities, since the EU 2020 Strategy has set the objective of an employment rate of 75% of the working population. However, let us not delude ourselves. This budgetary procedure will be a long and difficult one, contrary to what Mr Lewandowski indicated in the French press when he anticipated the position of the MEPs. The Member States have already expressed their short-term view of the budget, which advocates discipline, and have called for a limit on their contribution to financing Community action. They see the European Union and its action not as a means to achieve added value or as a means to help it achieve ambitious policies, but rather as an additional cost. Let us not be mistaken. The 2012 budgetary procedure will provide another insight into the tactics being used to define the future multiannual financial framework. The fact is, with a budget which accounts for a mere 2% of the EU’s public expenditure, it will be difficult to pursue ambitious policies in all sectors. We are already seeing stormy debates on whether it will be the CAP or cohesion policy that will be plundered. This pits citizens against each other when it would be to our credit to help them work in synergy. That is why, Commissioner, I would reiterate the importance of your communication on the implementation of own resources. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Here we are at the start of a difficult negotiation between Member States on the 2012 budget while, in the background, the debate is already underway on the post-2013 financial perspectives. At this time of crisis, it will be necessary throughout the budgetary process to reiterate our expectations with regard to European policies. Unlike some Council members who consider the EU to be an additional cost, an expense to be reduced at the risk of pitting current and future policies against each other, Parliament, through the resolution on general guidelines for the preparation of the 2012 budget, has reiterated its vision of the Union as a vector of added value and an ally of Member States in implementing ambitious policies. Furthermore, I voted in favour of the resolution presented by Mrs Balzani because of its consistency and the clear political message it carries, calling for the adoption of a budget that is consistent with the objectives for employment and growth of the EU 2020 Strategy. Finally, I took advantage of the debate in plenary to challenge the Commissioner for Financial Programming and the Budget on the urgent need for a communication on the implementation of new own resources, which, I hope, will carry this debate forward.

 In the absence of other alternative solutions proposed by the Council, it was necessary to vote in favour of making the European stability mechanism permanent, in order to provide assistance to our Greek, Portuguese and Irish colleagues. However, the debate is far from over. This concession made by the French socialists is not an indicator of the outcome of other forthcoming debates on the economic governance issue. Faced with the introduction of this intergovernmental mechanism, it is important to move forward and implement instruments which will encourage recovery in growth and business. It is, among other things, to ensure that we are able to finance such instruments that I am campaigning alongside my socialist colleagues for an increase in the European Union’s own resources. We could also use the Structural Funds in conjunction with the European stability mechanism to make deficit countries converge upwards. It is with ambitious budgets and the promotion of a European social model that we will be able to emerge from the crisis. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 The adoption of a parliamentary resolution on the draft strategy for the Atlantic region is an opportunity for me to point out the urgent need to work at European level on a common approach regarding the use of our maritime areas and to find a joint solution to the problems that exist. The Channel is a particularly illuminating example in this respect: a strategic maritime gateway to the European Union, it is both an essential link between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea (it contains 20% of the world’s fleet and more than 500 vessels over 300 tonnes sail through it every day) and an area dedicated to fishing, leisure activities, aggregate extraction and soon – much to my satisfaction – energy production from offshore wind farms. This concentration of activities calls for serious thought to be given to the issue of managing maritime safety in that area at European level, as part of a joint strategy. That is why, during the debate on the strategy for the Atlantic region, I once again called on Mrs Damanaki, Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, to include the Channel in the proposal that she is due to submit in June.

 The adoption of the Podimata report was the chance for Parliament to show unequivocal support for the introduction of a tax on financial transactions at European level. Until now, the European right had always frustrated the proposals by the socialists on this matter, whether in parliamentary committees or in plenary sessions. The fact that a majority of MEPs, and hence a section of the right, have been won over by this project, which has been advocated for many years by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is good news. It shows that, together, we are gradually becoming aware of the merits of this project. This vote marks a new stage in the process of introducing a financial instrument that would serve, in particular, to generate additional own resources for the EU budget, but also to support development initiatives internationally. However, the fight is not over. For the time being, this is only a policy position. Beyond their statements, we must remain alert to the genuine willingness of European Heads of State or Government, a large majority of whom are right-of-centre, to introduce this tax.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted with these plans for an integrated strategy for the Atlantic region. We need a common approach to the uses of our maritime spaces that takes the specific features of each basin into consideration and finds joint solutions to the problems that exist. In particular, as an elected representative of Normandy, I would like to draw your attention to the specific situation of the Channel, which must also be incorporated into the plans for an integrated strategy for the Atlantic region. The Channel is one of the European Union’s strategic maritime gateways and is an essential link between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea. It contains 20% of the world’s fleet and more than 500 ships over 300 tonnes sail through it every day. On top of this transport activity, there are also fisheries, leisure activities, aggregate extraction and soon – much to my satisfaction – energy production from offshore wind farms. This concentration of activities calls for serious thought to be given to the issue of managing maritime safety at European level, which I feel must be discussed as part of the Atlantic strategy also. As you know, the bilateral bases on which funding for safety is based are currently under threat. I have already alerted you to this point Commissioner and I will be paying close attention to the proposals you will be making in June. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Adopted in 2006, the Services Directive, which should have been transposed into national law before 28 December 2009, continues to raise questions in the Member States and within local authorities that are directly affected by it. The parliamentary own-initiative report by Mrs Gebhardt, which proposes an initial assessment of the directive’s implementation, thus touches on some of these difficulties, and especially the uncertainty surrounding social services and services of general economic interest (how are they defined? which areas are affected?), as well as the lack of transparency of the transposition process in some Member States. Moreover, it must be said that France stands out due to its problematic lack of transparency and inflexibility in implementing this directive. It has scores of decrees and implementing laws, and a restrictive interpretation of the exemptions set out in the directive, which raises doubts as to the future of some services, such as childcare and care for the disabled. Now more than ever, this own-initiative report, which has been adopted by a large majority, is an opportunity to point out that MEPs, and especially the Socialists, will continue to be vigilant with regard to the implementation of this directive and its impact on public services.

The adoption of the Commission’s proposal for a regulation setting emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles seems to me, more than anything, to be a gamble on the future. The compromise reached on limiting average CO2
 emissions to 147 g/km by 2020 does not meet the initial ambitions of my fellow Members on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, who had previously advocated a decidedly more ambitious objective (135 g/km). They were supported in this by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. Behind this ‘battle of numbers’, however, there is a balance to be struck between the environmental challenges that everyone recognises and certain social and industrial requirements which must not be forgotten. That is why it seems appropriate to me that the compromise will be adopted only following the revision of the regulation by January 2013 and only following the feasibility study and reassessment of the objectives. Not only will this revision allow us to return to this subject quickly and to go further in the fight against vehicle pollution, but it will also be an opportunity to address the issue of EU research and innovation in the field of road haulage. The date is set for 2012. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Today’s adoption of the 2011 budget has highlighted the European Parliament’s double failure. The budget that it adopted is too small: +2.91%, which falls far short of its first reading (+6%) and of the Commission’s initial proposal (+5.8%). The amounts adopted are exactly the same as those proposed with no real room for the Council to negotiate, hardly reassuring in terms of the negotiability of future budgets. Ever since the Treaty of Lisbon was implemented, Parliament has acted with the Council in codecision on budgetary matters: by not getting any precise commitment to date on the role that we, as MEPs, will have in preparing the next financial framework and on providing the necessary reflection on new own resources, we run the risk of allowing the Council to become lord and master over the future of the European project. So, given the positioning of certain Member States, there is a real risk that this project will flounder. What dismays me the most is the attitude displayed by the European right as they were more than determined at the start of negotiations to drop out the minute the telephones began ringing from Heads of State or Government. Everyone will make their own mind up about the political consistency of such a reversal. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 In my view, the EU Solidarity Fund, like the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, is one of the budgetary tools that give the strongest practical expression to the ‘solidarity’ value that we Members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament strive to promote when drafting Community policies. On 27 and 28 February 2010, storm Xynthia killed 53 and injured around 80 in Vendée and Charente-Maritime. It was a genuinely traumatic experience for the region and the nation, and its psychological and economic impact is still being felt 10 months later. As from the March 2010 plenary session, Parliament took action, adopting by a very large majority a resolution calling for the fund to be used to provide assistance to the victims. Today’s vote, which confirmed the release of EUR 35.6 million for these departments, as well as EUR 31.2 million for Portugal, which suffered flooding in Madeira caused by this storm, is an example of this common desire to show true solidarity between European citizens. This is the Europe we wish to build, a Europe close to its citizens, alert to the issues affecting them, and capable of addressing those issues collectively. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

We have here a case of coincidental timing: Parliament has been asked to give its opinion today on six requests for European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) assistance that have been submitted by the Netherlands while, at the same time, the 2011 budget negotiations are stalling because of the refusal by the Netherlands and by two other Member States to engage in a responsible and constructive dialogue on the future of the European budget. Today’s votes are therefore, in my view, an opportunity to point out that the European budget is not just an accounting tool that everyone finds daunting: it is, first and foremost, the ‘power’ behind the European Union that enables it to work day in day out to protect its citizens, and particularly through the EGF, to protect unemployed workers. The vote on the allocation of EGF aid to the Dutch workers could have been used as a ‘protest vote’ against the Dutch Government, which is criticising on the one hand what it is benefiting from on the other. Instead, it has been an opportunity for Parliament to recall that the principle of solidarity must be the foundation on which all EU decisions are made. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, as a result of the austerity policy conducted by the Cameron government, the United Kingdom has just decided to stop funding the large tugboats designed to assist and rescue ships in the English Channel, a unilateral decision that has been condemned by the port, maritime, trading and political bodies of that area. The announced withdrawal of the United Kingdom could have tragic repercussions for the maritime safety of this sector, which, with more than 250 000 vessels a year, is the busiest trading route in the world. Over the last 10 years, nearly 300 incidents have been recorded there, and experts believe that the pre-positioning of high-powered salvage vessels has prevented a number of these incidents from turning into major accidents. Since maritime safety affects the safety of EU territory and the protection of the environment, emergency towing is the responsibility of the public authority, with the financial assistance of shipowners, and must not be privatised for the benefit of private towing companies. The European Commission therefore has a duty to take up this matter. Indeed, Europe must afford itself the resources to implement the major integrated maritime policy that it is officially calling for. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 As a Member for a port town in Normandy, and member of the Intergroup for Seas and Coastal Affairs, I have followed the report on the integrated maritime policy (IMP) closely. On various occasions, I have emphasised the need for ensuring harmonious cohabitation between the different uses of the sea, one that promotes traditional activities (such as fishing, and I asked for it to be placed top of the list of maritime activities included in the report, as a symbolic gesture), and one that also facilitates the development of new activities. Thus I noted that the sector of renewable energies, including off-shore wind energy, should be supported in particular, because it is in line with European objectives around the diversification of sources of energy supply, and can, between now and 2020, mean a gain of 410 000 jobs in Europe, according to a study by the Commission. Finally, with the rapporteur, I amended the report to apprise the Commission of the need to fund the IMP. The initial exchanges within the Committee on ‘policy challenges and budgetary resources for after 2013’, of which I am a member, indeed raised doubts about the long-term funding of the regional cohesion policy, some of the programmes of which relate to the IMP.

Once again, Parliament has been asked to validate payment of aid from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to employees made redundant as a result of the crisis or relocations. Once again, this aid will be spread across budgetary lines initially allocated to other European programmes, as the Globalisation Adjustment Fund does not have any funds of its own within the current financial framework. In order to put an end to this situation, I worked, during the drafting of the 2011 budget, on the creation of a line of payment appropriations specific to the Globalisation Adjustment Fund. The sum of EUR 50 million was therefore adopted by Parliament during the vote on its reading of the budget on 20 October 2010. This sum, which is symbolic compared with annual requirements, has yet to be confirmed, as the European Council initially rejected the proposal to give the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund its own financing. I shall therefore continue to keep an eye on this question, in the hope of achieving budgetary and legislative consolidation of this mechanism. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as our debate again shows, we are all in agreement on one thing: the more Europe enlarges, the greater the powers entrusted to it, the more it displays its ambitions and the fewer resources it has to bring them to fruition. So everyone agrees on the diagnosis, but clearly we are not in agreement about what we need to do to extricate ourselves from this financial deadlock. As what was short-term has lasted, the Union budget has become a prisoner of national contributions, which make up almost 75% of its resources. Today, if we decided to raise the expenditure ceiling to the maximum threshold allowed by the treaties, this would mean an additional levy of more than 5 billion for countries like France and Germany. Everyone here clearly agrees that this is not possible. It is not a question of stepping up discipline, as it is the people and, principally, the poorest people who pay the highest price for the consequences of these national austerity policies. Considering that the financial sector bears the main responsibility for the crisis and explosion in public debt, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament proposes that a line of ‘own resources’ should be created funded by a financial transactions tax; this proposal was rejected within the Committee on Budgets by the right, which may make up for it tomorrow and bring its actions into line with the numerous statements they have made to the media in favour of this measure. It is a little more than two years since the fall of Lehman Brothers, and Parliament must not pass up an historic opportunity to create the foundations for a new development model, based on more lasting resources and certainly ones that are more just in terms of redistribution of wealth and solidarity. For the first budget voted on under the Treaty of Lisbon, this would send a strong political signal from our Parliament, which does not intend to make do with using its new codecision powers to manage penury, that is, to choose which of Peter or Paul is to go without clothing. Giving oneself the means, starting tomorrow, to increase the size of the Union budget, is to give oneself the means to pursue ambitious economic recovery, research, industrial, and employment policies. Let us not fail to grasp this opportunity that European citizens expect of us and which, in any case, the financial operators are expecting of us. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

I voted for Mrs Matera’s report on mobilising the Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the workers of the clothing industry in Spain. As I said in September during the debate on the EGF’s future after 2013, I am disappointed that this fund, set up to support workers made redundant ‘for reasons of recession or globalisation’, is currently not financially guaranteed in the European budget. Indeed, I do not believe that tapping into the financial resources of other European programmes to finance the EGF is a viable solution in the long run. Therefore, when the Committee on Budgets voted for mobilising the EGF for the Spanish employees mentioned in the Matera report, I pointed out, along with the Belgian Socialist MEP Mr Daerden, the need to work towards defining a separate budget heading for this funding.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in brief, what does the European Commission’s proposal convey? First, a glaring lack of ambition. The Commission, supported by the Council, has refused to revise the multiannual financial framework, and has salved its conscience by proposing technical adjustments only – adjustments that were, in any case, inevitable, since they relate to the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon. Second, a breach of the undertakings given to Parliament. In fact, and this must be said, in 2006, Parliament accepted, albeit half-heartedly, what it had already, and quite rightly, understood to be an out-of-date financial framework, without room for manoeuvre; in short, one of resignation. It therefore made its support conditional on the guarantee of an in-depth overhaul of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) at the half-way stage. A fine demonstration of the lack of importance that the Commission and the Council attach to Parliament’s decisions, in paying no regard to them whatsoever – a Parliament, it must be remembered, that is sovereign and represents the people. Third, this proposal lays bare a paradox, namely one of increased powers, entrusted by the States to the Union, of large-scale projects, preferably European, within a budgetary framework that the Council and the Commission will not allow to evolve, even though they know it is not fit for purpose. They prefer to call on redeployment – a miracle cure in their eyes, but to mine, a narrow vision of the European project. What is more, how can we explain to the people of Europe without blushing that key projects are either not financed at all, such as the financial stabilisation mechanism, despite its heavy media coverage, or financed like the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), by tapping into heading 1a, which is intended for competitiveness, growth and employment, all policies meeting the public’s expectations? We are heading straight for the wall, while sounding the horn. Parliament knows it, and it is one of the virtues of the Böge report that it says so. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

 I have supported this joint motion for a resolution because I am convinced that we urgently need to condemn the policy of the French Government, which has deliberately stigmatised an ethnic group by associating it directly with criminality, for the sole purpose of diverting attention away from the difficulties with its home affairs policy. This exploitation of the Roma issue is unacceptable in my view, and Parliament ought to react. Progressive Members, including the Social Democrats, have therefore demanded an end to this discriminatory rhetoric and to the collective expulsions, whereas the European right wing has largely supported the French Government in its drift to the right. We urgently need to implement a global strategy to tackle this subject, which affects 10-12 million EU citizens. This resolution deplores the lack of any reaction from the Commission, which is, however, supposed to be the guardian of the Treaties and as such should have condemned the French Government’s actions. The collective expulsions effectively make a mockery of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.

 I voted for the Portas Report. I support its main aim, which is to continue with the EGF, since, aside from the crisis we are going through, globalisation has a long-term adverse impact for our industrial jobs, which the European right refuses to accept. Furthermore, I helped amend this text so that SMEs and sub-contractors are taken into consideration when the EGF is allocated. Their employees are particularly vulnerable due to their dependence on multinationals, so it is vital that the EGF gives them real prospects for vocational retraining in the event of redundancy. I am also pleased that it has been recognised that studies need to be performed on the state bodies responsible for producing dossiers, so as to optimise utilisation of the EGF, which is often little-known and underused, particularly in France. Given that the European right has refused to continue the EGF after 2013, I will therefore fight in the debate on the next EU financial perspective for it to be kept permanently.

Madam President, Commissioner, it is a pity that the European budget, which should be a symbol of solidarity and the will to act together, has become a rigid tool, which the citizens do not understand and which lags behind the expectations of European society, incapable of being deployed to fight the social repercussions of the crisis. From this point of view, not a day passes without the media or a top-ranking politician talking about the need for a stronger European budget. Tension is increasing between revenue that is too modest, too dependent on the contributions of the Member States, and the money that the Union needs to spend in order to kick-start growth. For example, in the draft budget for 2011, the Commission simply presents a margin for manoeuvre of EUR 50 million to support new projects linked to employment and corporate competitiveness, which are top priorities. The revision of the financial framework is therefore a serious challenge for the future of the Union if we want to make it a real political and economic leader and also, and above all, a player that is closer to its citizens at a time when nearly 25 million of them are affected by unemployment. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Mr President, in essence, the vote on the budget is a profoundly political act, and we must learn a political lesson – a major, fundamental political lesson – from the budget being proposed to us. The European Union budget, and particularly this one, reflects the lack of a European political project even though, against a backdrop of crisis and at the start of our new mandates, European citizens need it more than ever. This budget marks the absence of a global vision for Europe. The Council and the Commission have chosen to let the Member States develop their own, often rival, recovery plans, and have abandoned efforts to coordinate an economic, social and environmental recovery at EU level. There has been no leverage attempt, no encouraging of European solidarity. The Council and the Commission are easing their consciences by applying a recovery plan bit by bit. Indeed, the 2010 budget provides funding for the second part of the recovery plan totalling EUR 5 billion, a derisory amount. Admittedly, it will allocate EUR 300 million to the milk fund, but this is insufficient when we know that in France, for example, the net income of farmers fell by 34% in 2009. The 2010 budget earmarks EUR 25 million for microfinance and, against the advice of the Council, allows the draft budget relating to Cohesion Fund interventions to be kept. It is therefore somewhat through the lack of an alternative and by default that we shall vote for this budget, because Europe – the citizens – cannot do without its interventions, however inadequate. Nevertheless, together, we must question – and this is urgent – the methods of financing the ambitious policies with which Europe must equip itself and of extracting the EU budget from its current restricted and unsuitable framework. Above and beyond major political declarations, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, must tell us how he intends to finance the future European policies about which he talks so much, particularly those relating to the new strategy on growth and to climate change. From now on they will be unable to make do with such a feeble budget as the one we are being offered. Estelle Grelier  (S&amp;D

Madam President, as an MEP from Normandy, I would like to draw the Commission’s and Parliament’s attention to the proposals on offshore Natura 2000 sites, which the French Government has just submitted to the European authorities. These proposals exclude the Antifer dyke situated near Etretat, but compensate for it by enlarging the perimeter to 12 nautical miles. This decision eases the way for Poweo to install a methane terminal at Antifer and restricts a project to create an offshore wind farm off Fécamp, despite the support shown for this project by local elected representatives, the population and even fishermen. A scientific and consistent proposal has been drafted for the region and has the backing of local operators. Under this proposal there will be six miles of zoning along the entire coastline, including Antifer. I have three questions: how much progress has the Commission made in examining the zoning proposals? Does it endorse them even though they go against scientific opinions and against the social, economic and cultural activities of the region? And, with the Copenhagen Summit approaching, can Europe reasonably endorse a decision that promotes gas at the expense of the development of renewable energies? Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 I voted against this appointment. France is preparing to make crucial progress on equal rights by adopting a law on marriage for all, at last joining several other Member States who have done the same. I believe that Tonio Borg’s appointment would contradict that progress in France and in Europe. His proposed portfolio – European Commissioner for Health – is fundamentally incompatible with his past statements and actions on contraception, abortion, and homosexual and transsexual rights. The holder of this position is meant to work for all European citizens, irrespective of their sex and their sexual orientation. Against a backdrop of particularly vicious comments and acts by extremists in France, appointing Tonio Borg would mean that Europe can accommodate such deviations. It is clear to all French Socialists that fundamental rights are not a matter for subsidiarity: they are universal. Irrespective of competence, this is an ethical matter: the European citizens have the right to expect Europe and the European Commissioners to defend these values without fail.

 In the opinion of the French Socialists, the national and European laws must be extremely strict, for example on extraction by hydraulic fracturing –the only type we are currently aware of – in order prevent any damage to the environment. It is not a question of denying the importance of energy independence and the effect of energy prices on the competitiveness of industry. Our priority must be to guarantee a high level of protection for human health and the environment. I regret that an amendment that I co-signed, calling for a European moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, did not obtain a majority today. Despite this setback, I welcome the action of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, which was crucial in ensuring the primacy of two particularly important principles: the precautionary principle and the ‘polluter pays’ principle.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to draw your attention to the case of Aurore Martin, the French citizen arrested in Spain and handed over to the Spanish authorities who is serving a 12-year prison sentence. Her crime consists in having participated in Spain in meetings of the Batasuna party, a party that is illegal in Spain but legal in France where it even has some elected representatives. She is the subject of a European arrest warrant that has been enforced. Although the establishment of the European arrest warrant in 2004 was greeted as the first step towards a European area of security and justice, today there are differences in its implementation that create inequalities between citizens of the European Union, and that is contrary to the very spirit of the framework decision establishing the European arrest warrant. Moreover, where there are important political implications, as in the case of this Basque activist, shouldn’t the European arrest warrant include broader exceptions and not be issued automatically so as to provide a better guarantee of fundamental rights, including the freedom of expression, which has been prejudiced in the case of Aurore Martin?

 Our votes have shown that the majority of Members did not favour transferable fishing concessions (TFCs) aimed at liberalising the fishing industry. The adopted text still, unfortunately, makes reference to TFCs, but they are now optional. A more watered-down position has also been adopted on the compulsory landing of discards; what is currently under consideration is a gradual implementation on a case-by-case basis, taking account of the different characteristics and realities of the fisheries. While the landing of all incidental catches and by-catches was to be approved in the basic regulation, we have also achieved the guarantee of financial compensation for fishing professionals in the text on the common market organisation. Finally, a compromise was reached in relation to maximum sustainable yield, so that this rate could be applied at the latest in 2020, and not in 2015. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 Parliament has today approved a directive on energy efficiency that should enable us to aim for energy savings of 20% by 2020, which represents considerable progress. I particularly welcome the fact that the directive specifies a series of compulsory measures that contribute to the goal of energy efficiency. These include renovating public buildings, a strategy to encourage investment in renovating housing stock and commercial premises, cogeneration, energy saving certificates, and so on. The Commission has also agreed to publish a list of additional sectoral initiatives in order to ensure that the overall target of 20% energy savings by 2020 is really achieved. The course has been set; it is now up to Member States to implement this directive as quickly as possible. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

We must detect, assess and prevent the undesirable effects of medicines that are put on the market in the European Union, and we must do so at European level.

 I voted against this useless and dangerous text, whose only worth is that it has instigated pan-European debate and highlighted the democratic checks in place in Europe to tackle the relentless lobbying of some of the large multinationals. Today, not only have we voted against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), we have actually voted for European democracy. Showing little regard for the EU’s Treaties, citizens and democratic principles, the Commission has been negotiating the ACTA behind Parliament’s back since 2007.

 Earlier today, we voted in favour of the general introduction of eCall, an in-vehicle emergency call system. This system, which is public and open, could contribute significantly to reducing the road death toll. That is why we have been advocating it since 2003. Unfortunately, for commercial reasons, car manufacturing lobbies want to impose private optional systems, which was supported by France’s former government which did not wish to invest in the scheme, and by several French MEPs from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Saving a life does indeed have a financial cost, but it is our duty as European law makers to show that, with a high-performance safety system, the EU can and must protect citizens. We are now waiting for the Commission to propose legislation quickly so that the system can become operational throughout the European Union by 2015. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

Thanks to your stubbornness, your craftiness with regard to procedure, you have given us the opportunity to prove how important Parliament is as colegislator. Thank you, Commissioner, for having driven hundreds of thousands of citizens out into the streets to protest and 2.8 million people to sign petitions.

Thank you again for the millions of Internet users who have followed the debates and the votes in committee and who are still following us today. I would like to welcome them.

 Madam President, we will be holding a debate on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) tomorrow, but I wanted to raise an issue this evening which, although peripheral to the subject, I feel is extremely important. I am referring to what Commissioner De Gucht told the Committee on International Trade at its meeting on Wednesday 20 June. I quote: ‘If you decide on a ‘no’ vote before the European Court of Justice has handed down its ruling, let me tell you that the Commission will nonetheless continue with the proceedings currently before the Court. We have committed to this. A ‘no’ vote will not halt the proceedings before the Court of Justice’.

 Today, Parliament has adopted a proposal for a regulation on food intended for infants and young children and on food for special medical purposes. We socialists are delighted to have achieved a strengthening of the provisions on food intended for vulnerable people, stricter rules on composition and labelling and a framework for food being placed on the market. Another important advancement we have achieved is the creation of a single list at EU level specifying the vitamins and minerals that may be added to foods. My only reservation is that the draft legislation excluded ‘growing milks’ used for children aged one to three. For the socialists, it is important that dairy products intended for young children are also covered by this legislation. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 Parliament has expressed its view on the implementation of the proposals contained in the Single Market Act. By way of a reminder, in April 2011, the Commission presented 50 actions to be carried out by 2014 to build a single market focused on the citizens. In line with the socialists’ amendments to the resolution, I condemn the tenor of the Commission’s recent legislative proposals and communications: a very liberal vision is revealed in the Commission’s proposals, which focus on facilitating business to the detriment of measures aimed at jobs and the citizens. I welcome the fact that Parliament has supported the priorities held by the socialists, such as the rejection of social dumping, the promotion of quality jobs, defence of the social protection model, the fight against tax evasion, but also an ambitious growth initiative based on the social market economy.

 At a time when the Council ought to be discussing a growth initiative, along with the other weighty issues, we need to bear in mind Europeans’ main expectation: keeping a job or finding a new one. The social situation is getting more difficult every day. We are facing the threat of a lost generation: 5.6 million young people are unemployed, that is one young European out of every five. We socialists welcome the Commission’s new attitude towards several issues, such as the minimum wage, which, until now, have been taboo. It is a major issue if we wish to solve the problems of poverty and internal imbalances within the European Union. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 The PIP breast implants scandal – which broke in March 2010 – has brought to light the serious malfunctions in European health safety. These tragedies are forcing us to carry out an in-depth review of the functioning of the European and national bodies responsible for health matters. Parliament’s reaction is in line with the gravity of the scandal: the resolution, which I voted for, calls for greater cooperation between Member States and greater control measures for medical devices placed on the market. This is an ambitious resolution in my view, as it also calls on the Commission to consider a system of pre-market authorisation for certain categories of medical devices. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this text, which reviews the scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP). The European Union has granted trade preferences to developing countries since 1971. These provisions are regularly adapted to take account of each country’s economic growth. Today’s vote is the first review of this system under the codecision procedure. In fact, we could barely have hoped for the compromise agreed with the Council, given the vastly differing positions of the Member States. For French Socialists, this text succeeds on two key issues: ensuring that the large emerging countries no longer benefit from preferential access to the EU market and facilitating exports from the poorest countries. This new trade regime will therefore enable us to provide better support to developing countries and it will be a step forward in our fight for fair trade as it will officially exclude the emerging countries almost entirely.

 I voted for the adoption of the Podimata report on the introduction of a financial transaction tax (FTT). Since the current crisis was brought on by stock market and financial speculation, I therefore consider it logical and just that this tax is finally introduced. The latest Eurobarometer survey shows that 66% of Europeans are in favour of such a tax. Furthermore, the FTT and the new resources to which it leads must contribute to financing growth in Europe. From this perspective, we must defend a tax base that is as broad as possible and fight against exemptions and loopholes which would favour speculators. In this regard, I regret the overcautiousness of the European right wing, which preferred to exclude pension funds, as if that financial instrument could not, like any other financial instrument, be at the service of speculation!

 I voted for the adoption of this report, which calls for the establishment of more balanced and fairer trade relations between the European Union and China, because I take the view that globalisation must not be based on unfair competition. The aim of this text is to urge China, the second-biggest trading partner of the European Union, to respect not only the principle of reciprocity in terms of trade, but also the principles of balance and compliance with social and environmental standards. Furthermore, it is necessary to rebalance access to China’s internal market to bring it into line with that of the EU, which is much more open and transparent. That is why the EU must establish a genuine strategy to promote ‘fair trade’ and to protect its industries and some of its sectors from social and environmental dumping, which is practised by some of its partners, most notably China.

 I voted for the amendments disclosing the risks of conflicts of interest within the EU agencies and proposing that we take measures to prevent this kind of practice in future. I also decided to abstain from the final votes in the cases of the European Food Safety Authority, the European Medicines Agency and the European Environment Agency. The French socialists are concerned not to impede the smooth running of the important programmes currently under way and therefore wished to stop at abstention. The aim is to shed light on practices that could go against the original purpose of these agencies. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the compromise text, negotiated with the Council, on the ‘roaming’ regulation, which will mean Europeans pay less to use their mobile phones abroad. As the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, we have called for the removal of these artificial borders within the internal market because they go against the very spirit of the European project and its founding fathers. That is why we urged the Commission to act quickly to effectively end roaming from 2016. As well as applying lower mobile roaming tariffs than those currently being charged from July, the text introduces, for the first time ever, structural solutions that will enable consumers to freely choose another operator for roaming services, separately from their domestic operator, from July 2014.

 I voted against this agreement. Although the fight against terrorism is a major challenge for the European Union as it is for its partners, we believe that it should not be pursued at the expense of the fundamental freedoms of citizens. However, this compromise, far from respecting the principle of proportionality, did not offer sufficient progress in terms of protecting privacy to persuade me to support it. All the more so as it appears to be difficult to gauge how effective the control and data storage measures are in the face of terrorist acts which are frequently not very sophisticated. Furthermore, while these data should strictly only be used as part of the fight against terrorism, in reality the purposes for which they can be used are very broad and very ill-defined. The retention period, the need for anonymisation and deletion, as well as the right of access, correction and deletion for the citizens concerned, are also important reasons for my rejection of this agreement. As Ms Guillaume pointed out, this is an unfortunate situation because this agreement should, on the contrary, have provided the opportunity to ensure that high data protection standards prevail, as behoves the European Union.

 I voted for this motion for a resolution. Water is a ‘shared resource’ and access to water should constitute a fundamental and universal right. All local authorities must be able to use the management method of their choice. On this subject, many people are strongly criticising the European Union, its institutions and in particular the Commission for being responsible for privatisations, but we must remember that, at present, there is no compulsory European ‘internal market’ directive, as is the case for other public service networks. We will ensure that the European Union does not commit to liberalisation policies and, on the contrary, guarantees free democratic choice for all public authorities in terms of their organisation and management methods.

Madam President, Commissioner, I am joining my colleagues to call for the issue of collective management societies to be dealt with quickly. I agree with the proposals you have just made regarding the harmonisation of horizontal rules on transparency and regarding the rules on online music. However, I must insist on the aim of fair remuneration for artists. Since the start of the mandate, for several years even, the issue of remuneration for artists has been mentioned exclusively in the context of infringements to intellectual property rights, making Internet users the scapegoats for artists’ lack of earnings. Yet, we are forgetting that, for each CD, for example, authors and performers only receive, on average, 6% of the sales price and that, for websites that sell music online, they receive hardly anything, around 1% per sale. Fair remuneration for artists must therefore be at the heart of our revision of collective management for the digital era. Of course, we need more transparency. In France, the Standing Monitoring Committee for management societies and distribution of rights published a damning report last year on the remuneration of the managers of these societies, for example. This committee also denounced a wave of invoices and deductions for costs. Artists must be at the heart of our concerns and many voices from all of the political camps together are denouncing a system which, in the end, places more importance on intermediaries than artists — that is what Neelie Kroes said — or even an opaque, confiscatory system as the French Minister of Culture has branded it. Commissioner, I therefore think that, if we revise these collective management rights, our objective and our end goal must be the optimal perception of intellectual property rights. These are conditions which are not merely incidental in the fight against infringements to intellectual property rights but which represent an essential prerequisite to the respect of these rights by users.

 I abstained. As my colleague, Estelle Grelier, so rightly said, this 2012 budget is, in fact, a Council budget, with just a ‘bit of soul’ added by the European Parliament. We are not fooled by the Council’s ploy: the Member States’ main preoccupation is to impose austerity, but they will not openly admit to the impact that this choice will have on EU policies on the ground. In order to cope with the recession that European citizens are enduring, while States are having trouble funding themselves and austerity policies abound, we need an EU budget that will meet this challenge at the very least, and allow us to implement policies for regeneration. Employment and growth in Europe are at stake. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 Today the European Parliament adopted the ‘economic governance’ package, after lengthy negotiations. For us, French and European socialists, it represents an austerity pact that prevents the Member States from kick-starting the economy and protecting themselves from the markets. In the end, only the proposals made by our colleague Elisa Ferreira will enable us to deliver specific solutions to the macroeconomic imbalances that undermine the sustainability and social bases of the euro area. We refuse to accept that Greece should be made solely responsible for the worsening of the economic divergences within the euro area. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 The European Parliament today adopted the Matias report which aims to establish a new strategy for research and innovation. As someone committed to the idea of progress, I believe that investment in research and innovation is fundamental to improving each of our lives. While I am delighted that there are several European programmes in this area, I, like my socialist colleagues, am convinced that numerous aspects could be improved upon: excessive bureaucracy, barriers to risk-taking by researchers, complexity, etc. All of this makes participating in these programmes difficult, particularly for SMEs.

 I voted in favour of this report. Today, Parliament reaffirmed its wish to see social, environmental and human rights standards made compulsory and legally binding in all trade agreements concluded by the EU. Faced with pleas from our fellow citizens for more regulation and new forms of solidarity, the EU must redefine a new doctrine for a different kind of trade policy. If Europe does not champion fairer trade based on values, and which creates quality jobs in Europe as well as the rest of the world, who else will? Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 The introduction of this common platform of rights for all consumers within the Union represents a real step forward for the citizens of other countries where consumer information requirements are not as high and where the period for withdrawal is less well protected. However, it has given mixed results, as the aim of the Commission and the European right has been above all to facilitate cross-border trade, and not to harmonise upwards consumer protection. It is therefore a small step for the French consumer but a big step for the European consumer. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 We, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialist and Democrats in the European Parliament, introduced radical changes to the draft produced by the German conservative rapporteur of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), regarded by many as woefully inadequate, and we succeeded in obtaining a majority in the European Parliament on the objective of a fairer allocation of agricultural payments. The abolition of historical reference values, aid to farmers with small farms, a rebalancing in favour of the livestock sector and, above all, the adoption of the principle of the degressivity of direct payments, taking employment and the environment into account, represent crucial progress in this regard. I welcome the work carried out, which will also have made it possible to put in place tools committing agriculture to move towards more sustainable development, while taking into account the objectives of food security, the environment, territories and jobs. The greening of payments of the first pillar will also make it possible to encourage farmers to adopt good farming practices and to be more economically and ecologically efficient. Dacian Cioloş, Member of the European Commission responsible for Agriculture and Rural Development, must now use this report to put forward some good proposals by the end of this year.

 I voted in favour of the report. Some Member States, including France, Germany and the Netherlands, want to change the rules of the game. However it is not reasonable to add other criteria such as an assessment of policies on combating corruption and crime.

 I voted in favour of this report. The great virtue of this report is to seek to mobilise all the EU’s budgetary resources in a coherent fashion and as a means to achieve the Europe 2020 strategy, and to take a stand that is diametrically opposed to the narrow approach of most Member States. While these Members bring Europe down to the common denominator of their contributions, which they would like to see fall, and of its financial returns, which they would like to see increase, this report argues for strong, integrated community policies, both in terms of long-standing policies and in terms of the new competences entrusted under the Treaty of Lisbon.

 Mr President, Commissioner, we can see that the application of the European Arrest Warrant raises the issue of detention which is very unevenly applied from one Member State to another. Some States show demonstrable laxity when it comes to respecting fundamental rights in a prison environment. Furthermore, amongst the 600 000 prisoners in the European Union, increasing numbers are detained in a Member State other than their own, due, precisely, to the European Arrest Warrant. Consequently, they do not enjoy the fundamental rights guaranteed by their state of origin. In circumstances such as these, there is no point in hurling abuse at each other; action must be taken. That is why, last January, my colleague, Mr Lambrinidis and I submitted a written statement calling for the harmonisation of detention standards throughout the European Union, and the introduction of independent national inspection mechanisms. I hope, Commissioner, that in the Green Papers that you will propose, you will bear this issue in mind, and that there will soon be a common platform of minimum rights which applies to all Member States.

I voted in favour of this report, not with the aim of putting up protectionist barriers, but because we can no longer have a situation in which the European Union is the only one respecting the rules of the game. We can no longer ignore social and economic dumping in emerging countries, China in particular, which are winning contracts with rock-bottom prices in the countries of the Union, without regard for social rights and legislation on State aid, whereas the markets of these countries remain inaccessible to European companies. We can no longer be naïve: the survival of our businesses and our jobs depends on this. Finally, I am pleased that the amendments submitted by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament concerning respect, in the context of public contracts, for the labour, social and environmental standards in force in the Member States, have largely been adopted. That demonstrates real awareness and represents a positive and necessary change. It is now for the Commission to assess this call fully. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

I voted in favour of this report to enable the transformation of a report which is all too often about exploitation and the law, in an area which represents between 5 and 9% of all jobs within the European Union. All those who work with our elderly people must be able to enjoy freedom of association and rest time, and must not be subject to harassment and arbitrary practices. That is why we wanted to send a strong message of support to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the trades unions prior to the negotiations on the adoption of these new instruments, which will commence in June at the 100th International Labour conference. We regret, however, that the right is happy to express concerns about illegal domestic workers while refusing to recognise that all too often, such situations involve workers with no papers, who are the main victims of precarity and abusive practices.

 I voted in favour of this report, which will enable the exponential demand for access to high frequency-consuming mobile Internet to be met in the short term, in particular, through the allocation of the entire 800 MHz band, freed up by the changeover to digital television in our various countries, to electronic communications services. In the medium to long term, our aim must be to improve the use of spectrum across the board, by recognising its social, cultural and economic value. At the same time, we are promoting innovative technologies (femtocells, cognitive technologies) in order to respond qualitatively to the demand for use of frequencies. This will contribute to the objectives that the Union has set itself, including that of bridging the digital divide, so as to ensure that all Europeans have broadband access by 2015.

 I voted in favour of this report as it is important to clarify matters at a time when the role of lobbies is still giving rise to much debate and, at times, conjecture among European citizens. We regret, however, that the registration of organisations has not been made compulsory, especially as it is a de facto
 obligation to register in order to receive a card to enter our premises. On the other hand, we have fought to ensure that the offices representing local, regional and municipal authorities in the European institutions are not affected by this measure, contrary to what was planned in the initial text. We consider these structures to be the direct product of democratically elected bodies. They represent the general interest, and should therefore be distinguished from lobbyists, who defend individual interests. Nevertheless, this register is an important step forward because, in many areas, the lack of transparency surrounding the role of lobbies can present a real democratic problem.

 I voted against this report. We want a free trade agreement between the EU and India that helps to promote sustainable development, and that is accompanied by clear clauses concerning respect for ILO standards, environmental rules and corporate social responsibility obligations. The right’s rejection of these requests is particularly regrettable. We also deplore the fact that the right-wing in Parliament rejected the amendment designed to ensure equal treatment of European and Indian workers. This is not only harmful to Indian workers; it is also very dangerous for European workers. We must not accept the liberalisation of services and social dumping aimed at bringing down European wages. Moreover, the European Union must not forget its founding principles. The Treaty of Lisbon stipulates that trade policy must contribute to sustainable development, eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights. Françoise Castex  (S&amp;D

 I voted against this joint motion for a resolution. The compromise resolution was a good starting point, and I supported the amendments in favour of a carefully planned and prepared phase-out of nuclear power, reflecting the fight against global warming. I also voted in favour of the amendments calling for investment in research and innovation, in order to promote energy saving and greatly increase the number of renewable forms of energy. However, the outcome of the vote – the incoherent vote – forced me to vote against the amended resolution.

 The European Union’s trade policy should be consistent with the general objectives set out in the Treaty on European Union and contribute to sustainable development, employment and social progress in Europe and in its partner countries, as well as to a form of globalisation in which human and social rights are respected. Ms Jaakonsaari’s report on a new enhanced partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and Kazakhstan points to the latter’s serious shortcomings with regard to democracy and human rights, in particular workers’ rights. It states that, in order to tackle these practices, which are incompatible with the objectives of the European Union, the trade component of the agreement must include a binding chapter on compliance with social, democratic and environmental standards. I call on the Commission to apply the recommendations set out in this report in the ongoing negotiations. In the event of serious breaches of human rights, the European Union should not be afraid to invoke all conditionality clauses included in the agreement and, if need be, to suspend it temporarily. This conditionality is a prerequisite for maintaining a fair external policy and even-handed trade policy. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 In the resolution on public procurement, the European Parliament has strengthened the Commission’s proposal towards a social Europe: the most significant step forward is that authorities should no longer opt for the lowest bid, but for the most economically advantageous tender – one which includes, for example, environmental aspects. Likewise, the issue of subcontractors is taken into account in order to prevent abuse in relation to working conditions and workers’ safety. Nevertheless, there is still progress to be made where European public procurement policy is concerned. In particular, the Commission must impose the principle of reciprocity on its trading partners: if the Union agrees to open up its public procurement markets to third-country operators, then European companies should also have access to markets and public works in these countries outside the EU. European companies and employment in Europe must be a priority when business opportunities are looked at. The Commission must ensure that its forthcoming Public Procurement Directive serves the dual purpose of providing more quality jobs and offering quality services to users. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Since its inception in 2001, the World Trade Organisation’s Doha trade negotiation round has had the task of redressing the balance of world trade rules in favour of developing countries. These negotiations have now stalled. Various factors have contributed to the stand-off, for which all parties bear some responsibility, but it is developing countries that will be hit hardest by the failure of the negotiations. Every effort must be made to conclude the negotiations, but also to take into account the concerns raised, not least by developing countries, and particularly the situation in sensitive industries and in agriculture, where food security for citizens must be the priority. Public services should still be governed by each country to reflect the public interest, rather than being liberalised as part of enforced horse-trading with no reference to social needs. Subject to these conditions, the conclusion of the Doha Round is both desirable and necessary. The proliferation of bilateral agreements – like those currently under negotiation – will prevent us from establishing clear and fair rules. Multilateralism is still the best framework for ensuring fair trade that will encourage sustainable development across all continents. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the comprehensive economic and trade agreement negotiated with Canada will strengthen our links with a large and long-standing EU partner country. We welcome this, but we must keep track of all its consequences, not just the benefits it will bring for certain economic sectors or certain major international investors. In particular, the agreement must respect the social and environmental models of both parties – of the EU Member States and of Canada – and their capacity to continue to legislate in what are sensitive areas for our societies. These are not mere details or points to be left for another day. As regards public services, the Commission’s chosen ‘negative list’ approach is dangerous. It is far too broad and ill-defined, and we would not like to see it set a precedent. Also, from a general point of view, the chapter on investment must respect both parties’ right to legislate in areas such as the environment, public health, employee and consumer rights, industrial policy and cultural diversity, among others. We call on the Commission to exclude sectors such as culture, education and public health from the scope of the agreements. In this respect, and as other Members have said, the intellectual property part should not call into question issues relating to generic medicine production. As for the environment, we are concerned and call for investment. As regards the impact of the agreement on oil sands drilling, the agreement must not have the effect of weakening European legislation on the application of the Fuel Quality Directive, nor must it limit the possibility for Canada to regulate drilling of its oil sands in the future under its environmental remit. We also call on the Commission – we are asking the question, anyway – to monitor the impact on the fisheries sector in areas such as St Pierre and Miquelon. These are areas of Europe that could be severely affected by the complete liberalisation of that sector. Lastly, I echo Mr Kazak in saying that the sustainable development chapter must include social and environmental commitments and, in particular, social and environmental responsibility on the part of large multinationals.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-India free trade agreement negotiations are ambitious, they concern many economic sectors, but they are also a cause for concern in Europe and in India, as I was able to see during last month’s meeting between the trade committee of the two chambers of the Indian Parliament and the European Parliament’s delegation for relations with India. India is booming; it is a strategic partner, as you have reminded us. Everyone understands the importance of developing trade between us. Yet we are not starting from scratch, since the Union is already India’s main trading partner, the main investor in India and the main destination for Indian investors, and India is also the main beneficiary of the system of generalised preferences. We will therefore have to be alert to any new impact that a new and more far-reaching trade agreement may have on fragile sectors of the Indian economy. I am thinking, for example, of agriculture – our Indian colleagues spoke to us about this – and of the consequences for sectors that are particularly exposed to competition from emerging countries in Europe, and I am thinking of the car industry. Such an agreement should serve the development of our societies and of employment and not give rise to uncontrolled liberalisation that would have disastrous effects. That is why my group wishes to emphasise a number of points in these negotiations, which should culminate in an agreement that helps achieve the objectives of sustainable development and poverty eradication, and which should also be accompanied by clear and verifiable commitments, on the basis of cooperation, of course, but then coupled with serious social and environmental commitments. I should like to emphasise a few points in particular. Firstly, regarding agriculture – which I mentioned earlier – we call on the Commission to ensure that none of the agreement’s provisions, either on the liberalisation of agricultural trade or on intellectual property rights, threaten small-scale farming in India. I am thinking of the provisions on seeds, for example. Secondly, regarding generic medicines, India is the biggest producer of generic medicines in the developing world. We call on the Commission to stop demanding data exclusivity, since all the NGOs say it is liable to harm the distribution of those medicines. Thirdly, in the area of services, we call, firstly, for public services to be left out of the sectors to be liberalised and, secondly, concerning mode IV, for the principle of equal treatment to be guaranteed – in other words, for all forms of social dumping to be rejected. Lastly – thank you, Mr President – we believe that the sustainable development chapter must include binding commitments in relation to respect for social and environmental standards, in particular, ILO social standards.

 The report by Mrs Guillaume is an important step towards the revision of EU rules on asylum and protection for applicants for 2012. In view of the terrible tragedies that have taken place, such as the recent sinking of a Libyan boat off Lampedusa, this revision is vital, particularly considering that an applicant’s chances of obtaining asylum may differ greatly according to the Member State. With this text, we are calling on the European Commission to include in the proposed revision the right to free legal advice from the start of the procedure; better consideration of vulnerable applicants, such as unaccompanied minors; and a framework for the time limit for appeals. My one regret, however, is that the European right adopted a tightening of accelerated procedures based on the notion that asylum seekers are primarily potential fraudsters, limiting their rights. However, the adoption of Mrs Guillaume’s report sends a clear signal to the Council and Commission that they need to work to guarantee all asylum seekers in Europe decent, fair conditions and procedures.

Too often, the European Union is distant from its citizens, its policies seem far removed, and the European project lacks meaning in the eyes of Europeans. If the Single Market is only to be a conduit for rampant liberalisation, deregulating public services, social systems and workers’ rights by submitting them to fierce competition, this is a cause for concern, even though it has and may have several positive specific consequences for consumers and in the everyday lives of our fellow citizens. With Mr Correia de Campos’s report, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have fought for better regulation when it comes to strengthening the Single Market, and for this strengthening to serve the general interest of Europeans and not just that of businesses. Such interests include consumers’ rights, the protection of workers’ rights against the tendency towards social dumping, with an explicit recognition of collective labour agreements in all the Member States of the Union, the call for a recognised framework for public services, and universal access to these services. The integration of the Single Market must now go hand in hand with the advances of a social Europe, which is needed more than ever at a time when the recession continues to affect Europeans.

 For over 10 years, the European socialists have been fighting in the European Parliament for a tax on financial transactions. This tax would have many benefits: not only would it discourage financial speculation; it would also fund aid to developing countries and their adaptation to climate change, while contributing to the European Union’s budget. The world is now in a different situation: the recession has made the need to stabilise the financial markets yet more acute, and the European Union needs new resources to overcome this recession – it must overcome it by means of a recovery, not by means of austerity. At the same time, the groundswell in favour of the tax is getting bigger: more and more governments are supporting the idea, and the European Parliament has already voted repeatedly in favour of introducing a tax on financial transactions. This new vote in favour of the tax is an important step: Parliament is saying that we must act immediately at European level, even if there is no global agreement. Parliament’s request is clear, and the vote was an overwhelming one: we must now turn our words into deeds and implement the tax on financial transactions. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Over the last few months, the Lithuanian Parliament has passed a series of laws forbidding or punishing any reference to homosexuality or bisexuality in public. A bill currently being debated in the Parliament aims to amend the Code of Administrative Offences to punish ‘the public promotion of homosexual relations’ with fines of up to EUR 2 900. This legislation is in complete breach of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and of the European Union Treaties which commit the EU and its Member States to upholding freedom of expression and fundamental freedoms and to providing European instruments to fight discrimination and human rights violations. In adopting this resolution, we are calling for this bill to be withdrawn, for respect for sexual orientation to be included in the list of principles protected under the country’s Law on Education, for minors to have the right to freely access information about sexual orientation and for clarification of the prohibition stipulated in the country’s Law on Advertising. This is not the first time that a Member State has impeded European citizens’ rights and freedoms regarding sexual orientation under the pretext of non-interference, thus, in effect, encouraging discrimination. This homophobic hysteria must stop. Harlem Désir,

Mr President, we are proposing a change to the beginning of paragraph 32 in agreement with the shadow rapporteurs. The first words of this paragraph would become – I will read it in English because we drew it up together in English:  ‘Calls to explore, within the same forums, the elaboration of an international convention ..’.  (FR)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to begin by thanking my colleagues in the Committee on International Trade and, in particular, the shadow rapporteurs from the various groups for their cooperation in the drafting of this third report on a related topic. Today, we are able, thanks to this cooperation, to present a set of innovative, concrete proposals to move corporate social responsibility forward within the framework of EU trade policy. After the international crisis and the economic and social damage it caused, and after the debates it prompted, the expectations voiced by the public and the political expectations for lessons to be learnt, our common conviction is that Europe’s trade policy must contribute more than ever to the objectives of regulating globalisation and, in particular, to its social and environmental objectives. This regulation concerns the States and their economies, but it is clear that the main economic players are undertakings and, in particular, multinational corporations: they are the main players in world trade. They are the ones that have benefited most from market liberalisation, not only in terms of gaining access to customers, but also in order to externalise part of their production and to diversify their supply arrangements, often by drawing on countries where production costs are low and, above all, where social and environmental rules are applied less rigorously. The liberalisation of trade has been accompanied by fierce competition among countries seeking to attract foreign investors and by stiffer competition between undertakings. All too often this has led to unacceptable abuses in relation to working conditions, and to human rights violations and environmental damage. From the Bhopal disaster at the subsidiary of a chemical multinational in India, which claimed thousands of victims and for which the parent company has still not been punished to this day, to the behaviour of oil and mining companies in Africa, in Burma, and in many other countries, which is destroying their environment and reducing their workers to the rank of slaves; and from child labour in Asian textile factories to the murder of trade unionists on agricultural holdings in Central America, the examples are legion. And they are all the more unacceptable given that they often concern undertakings from industrialised countries, their subsidiaries and their supply chain, including European undertakings. This gave rise, many years ago, to a debate and a campaign which, I might add, was supported on several occasions within this Parliament through the adoption of resolutions on corporate social and environmental responsibility. The progress made in corporate social responsibility (CSR) is not yet on a par with the debate on social standards in trade agreements, the subject of the report by Mrs Saïfi. This is understandable, because trade agreements concern legal rules that are binding among the States, whereas corporate social responsibility concerns voluntary commitments by undertakings. At the same time, however, it is paradoxical, because CSR and the social and environmental clauses pull in the same direction, namely, towards globalisation which is more respectful of human rights and the environment and which is conducive to sustainable development. We therefore propose to incorporate CSR into trade agreements and, specifically, to incorporate a corporate social responsibility clause into the chapters on sustainable development, especially of free trade agreements (FTA), with a number of clear and verifiable commitments by undertakings. First, there must be a reciprocal commitment between the European Union and its partners to encourage undertakings to enter into CSR commitments and to verify them: the establishment of contact points not only to foster the provision of information but also to receive complaints from trade unionists and civil society; a requirement for corporations to publish their balance sheets regularly, which will reinforce transparency; a reporting requirement; and a requirement for undertakings to show due diligence and to take preventive measures. Finally, we propose that, in the event of serious breaches of the principles underpinning CSR and also of the violation of social rights and social and environmental laws, there should be mechanisms ...

 Mr President, as you can see, I had two minutes left. You knew this, so, if you had a time issue earlier, you could have deducted the time from this part of my speech, which could have been shorter. I should especially like to thank my colleagues and the Commissioner for his reply. What has been striking in this debate is the very broad consensus extending beyond the differences between groups. This is, however, qualified by the need to genuinely take greater account of the social and environmental dimensions in trade policy, in the agreements we negotiate. When you cut me off for your very interesting speech, which I am sure our fellow citizens throughout the Union will have found fascinating, I simply wanted to raise a point that the Commissioner himself raised, which is that corporate social responsibility cannot – he is absolutely right – replace compliance with the law and the responsibilities of the Member States. Furthermore, Mr De Gucht is also right when he says that, at this very moment, within the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and also within the World Trade Organisation (WTO), as a result of Professor Ruggie’s report, which Mr Howitt mentioned, new steps have been proposed with regard to the responsibility of multinational companies, not only in relation to mining but also in many other areas of responsibility – especially as regards their foreign subsidiaries – within their spheres of influence or throughout their supply chains. Judicial cooperation will also ensure that a parent company cannot evade its responsibilities in relation to the action of one of its subsidiaries or of a subcontractor, when it has infringed environmental or social rules. All of this is absolutely critical. I simply believe, though I admit it will be difficult, that we must establish a link with trade agreements. There are already a small number of references to corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the agreement with Korea and in the agreements with Latin American countries. I believe that, through the dialogue we have begun today with the Commission, we must continue to ensure that our CSR objectives and our sustainable development objectives are consistent with each other in international trade agreements.

Following Parliament’s vote, the Union is, at long last, going to regulate the activities of the most speculative investment funds. A long time has passed since Poul Rasmussen’s own-initiative report which, back in 2008, proposed that strict limits should be imposed on these ‘financial black holes’. It has taken the financial crisis to make the Member States and the majority of Parliament agree to adopt binding legislation on alternative funds. For the first time, these funds, whether or not they are based in Europe, will be subject to controls, restrictions on their activities and greater transparency; carving up businesses will no longer be possible, and the European Securities and Markets Authority’s supervisory powers will be extended. Much remains to be done to supervise finance effectively in Europe; ESMA, not the national authorities, should be the only authority with responsibility for this matter, and businesses should be protected even more from speculation. Had it not been for the reservations of the conservatives, the Union could have adopted more rigorous and more effective legislation. This is merely a first step. The text we have adopted will be revised in four years’ time. This will be an opportunity to go further, on the basis of an assessment, in order to protect the economy and jobs from the damage caused by speculation. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

In order to ensure the continued security of international transport, especially in the face of the risk posed by terrorism, it is vital for countries to be able to exchange information on passengers – PNR data, collected by airlines. However, it is just as vital to ensure that these provisions do not jeopardise citizens’ fundamental freedoms or result in some people being discriminated against because of their origin or religion. That is why the protection of personal data must be guaranteed better. The European Parliament has one clear demand to make before the Commission starts negotiating the methods of exchanging PNR data with the United States, Canada and Australia: the protection of personal data is too sensitive a subject for these negotiations to be conducted exclusively among Member States, behind closed doors. They must be conducted transparently, at EU level. The data transferred must be used only within a strictly defined context and must not be transferred to a third country. Many types of information will have to be excluded from the data that can be collected, in particular, that information in connection with ethnic origin and religious beliefs. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Parliament has just voted at first reading for extending maternity leave to a minimum of 20 weeks all over Europe, paid at full salary, except for high earners, and the possibility for fathers to take at least two weeks’ leave following the birth of a child. This is a victory for the proponents of a social Europe and a step towards more equality between men and women in Europe. A section of the right used the future cost of these measures as an excuse to reject this progress. Yet helping parents to reconcile family and work life will make it easier for parents to go back to work, will boost European birth rates and will safeguard the health of mothers and babies. The left of Parliament, with Portuguese Socialist rapporteur Mrs Estrela, held strong, the European right was divided and the move towards progress won the day. The battle must now be won at the Council, where several governments are threatening to block this directive. Members of national parliaments should take this up and intervene with their government so that governments do not undo what the European Parliament is proposing for a Europe that protects its citizens’ rights.

 The crisis has revealed the shortcomings of Economic and Monetary Union: it nearly brought down the euro and has resulted in the loss of millions of jobs throughout the continent. With Pervenche Berès’s report, the European Parliament has just adopted a coherent strategy proposal to lift Europe out of the recession and to address the latter’s financial, economic and social repercussions. This proposal includes the introduction of real financial supervision, which we have started to implement, but which will have to be considerably strengthened; the taxing of financial transactions in order to regulate the markets and finance public assets, and to reduce public deficits; the coordination of Member States’ economic policies and budgets for the benefit of sustainable growth; the appointment of a Mr or Mrs Euro to be in charge of the euro area and to unify its representation at the G20 and IMF; and the creation of the European Energy Community. It is now time for Europe to get going again. This is what the public expects. In a constantly changing world, inertia is tantamount to decline. That is why we now need to move on from this report and take practical action. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 The reinforcement of health care systems in sub-Saharan Africa is a crucial aspect of development policies. Compensating for the shortcomings in care systems will also have an impact on public health worldwide, through improved training for medical professionals, appropriate prevention campaigns and reduced treatment costs. This will contribute to a fall in serious epidemics, such as HIV, tuberculosis and dysentery. It is not acceptable for private companies to hinder access to health care for the sake of profits, and it is even less acceptable for conservative religious movements to reject sexual and reproductive health policies and question the right to abortion, thereby putting the health of millions of women at risk. In order to improve the health care systems in sub-Saharan Africa and throughout the world, it is essential for the European Union to be more in step with the rest of the international community. In particular, it has a role to play in encouraging the emergence of non-profit-making, solidarity-based mutual health structures, enabling the promotion of access to quality health care. This is why I support the adoption of Mrs De Keyser’s report. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Yesterday saw the opening of the United Nations summit on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. Even if progress has been achieved, we are far from the objectives set for poverty reduction between now and 2015. In order to achieve them, the first imperative is job creation in the developing countries, as, according to a recent joint report by the IMF and the ILO, there are more than 210 million unemployed in the world in 2010, as the crisis has caused the loss of 30 million jobs since 2008. The ILO is calling for employment to no longer be considered as an outcome of other policies but as a primary objective and pillar of growth strategies. Sustainable development, support for jobs and support for decent work demand support for the diversification of the economy, compliance with ILO standards, a set of social protection rights for all, investment in public services and addressing basic needs such as access to water, to health and to food security. More employment will also be a prerequisite for the stability and strengthening of democracy. That is the thrust of the Theocharous report. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, for the first time, Parliament will be called on to give its assent to a readmission agreement. This is a very important responsibility which I believe Parliament must exercise seriously, since it involves the safety of the people concerned. Pakistan is a state which has neither signed nor ratified the Geneva Refugee Convention or the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons. This agreement could affect not only Pakistani nationals but also citizens of other countries fleeing war and disturbances, and here, I am thinking, in particular, of Afghans who could well find themselves, as a result of this agreement, being sent to a state that offers no guarantees whatsoever. Therefore, Parliament’s first – and, I think, most legitimate – request is that we be given an assessment of the previous readmission agreements, since this was, after all, what the Commission promised. Secondly, we call for Pakistan to sign these Geneva Conventions before any agreement is envisaged. Thirdly – and this is the very least we expect – we ask that Parliament be able to take part in the Joint Readmission Committee; in other words, that it also is able to monitor the terms on which any future agreement is implemented. As the situation stands at the moment, I do not think we should give our assent tomorrow. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

 The motion for a resolution on the situation of the Roma people is a major snub for Mr Sarkozy and a scathing call to order from the European Parliament. The stigmatisation of the Roma by the President during a speech on insecurity, the statements by his Minister for Home Affairs against the Romanians and the blatant expulsion of several hundred of them in breach of the law are an insult not only to the values of the French Republic but also to the fundamental values of the Union. Throughout history the Roma have been systematically marginalised, discriminated against and used as scapegoats. Regardless of whether they are French, Romanian or Bulgarian, today they are European citizens. The indignity of the treatment they have received should not be tolerated in a community founded on the principles of law, freedom, equality and non-discrimination, which lie at the heart of the EU Treaty and its Charter of Fundamental Rights. The resolution is therefore a firm and unambiguous condemnation of the French Government’s actions and of the discriminatory rhetoric that accompanied them. It condemns expulsions in breach of the law. It demands that the governments of Europe and the Commission coordinate their actions to integrate the Roma, using the funds allocated by Parliament.

Today, more than 20% of young people in Europe are unemployed, and many others are in casual jobs without social protection. The increase in the number of training courses casualises active young people and is a vector for social dumping affecting other employees, in that it puts pressure on companies to lower salaries and replaces normal jobs. The Turunen report asks the Commission and the Member States to organise their activities so that young people’s access to high quality training courses and jobs becomes a priority, and in order to guarantee them a decent income. It is unacceptable that some Member States are planning a lower minimum wage for young people. In this report, Parliament also calls for the introduction of a ‘European guarantee for youth’, which would give each young person in the EU the right to be offered a job, an apprenticeship, a supplementary training course or a job combined with a training course if that young person has been unemployed for four months. It also calls for the development of a ‘European Quality Charter on Traineeships’, which would include norms on time limits, minimum allowances and course-related social security benefits.

Achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 is a fundamental commitment by the international community. However, it has not provided itself with the resources to fulfil that commitment. Two-thirds of the way through, it is clear that many least developed countries (LDCs) will be unable to achieve any of the goals of eradicating poverty, of providing access to education and health care, and that most developing countries will be far from achieving them too. Europe is the world’s leading donor but, with 0.4% of GNI, it cannot be content with falling so far short of the target of devoting 0.56% to official development assistance (ODA) in 2010, a target that it set itself. The fact is, the aid requirements are greater than ever, especially in the areas of food security, the fight against climate change, education, health – in particular for HIV sufferers – and maternal and reproductive health. With the Cashman report, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is calling for the European Council of 17 June to endorse the proposal for a 0.05% tax on international financial transactions, which would yield EUR 10 billion, and to set itself the target of achieving 0.63% of European GNI in 2012, with a view to increasing it to 0.7%.

Developing countries, in particular, the poorest ones already hard hit by the 2007 food crisis, are today suffering the full force of the economic and social consequences of the international financial crisis that began in the developed countries. The latter are now inclined to reduce their development aid to face up to their own difficulties. Developing countries are thus paying twice for the mess caused by unregulated global capitalism. I voted for the Guerrero Salom report, which reminds Europe of its responsibilities and demands respect for the commitments made in relation to official development assistance, in particular, the goal of contributing 0.7% of GDP to this by 2015. By adopting it, Parliament is also calling for the implementation of an international levy on financial transactions to fund development, access to Global Public Goods and the adaptation of poor countries to the challenges of climate change. It supports cancelling the debt of the least developed countries. All of these recommendations are essential as we approach the review of the Millennium Development Goals at the United Nations in September.

The 2020 strategy is supposed to replace the Lisbon Strategy. It is, above all, in danger of prolonging the shortcomings, of ending in the same lack of results and of causing the same disappointment. It is neither a true recovery strategy nor a new perspective for the economic, social, budgetary and fiscal policies of the Union. The myriad good intentions are matched only by the absence of new instruments with which to implement them. Europe needs a different ambition; the citizens expect more convincing responses. Since the start of the crisis, the unemployment rate has increased by seven million. The banks are speculating again, hedge funds have not been regulated, the citizens are being asked to tighten their belts, drastic cuts are being made in public services and social protection is being cut back. The Greek crisis serves to reveal our lack of solidarity. That is why Europe must debate a different view of its future, one that is based on true economic coordination, a recovery characterised by solidarity, a green growth strategy, an energy community, a cohesion budget, own resources, investment in education, research, fiscal and social harmonisation, the fight against tax havens and the taxation of international financial transactions.

In 2000, I tabled with the Globalisation Intergroup the first resolution calling for the Commission to examine the feasibility of a tax on speculative capital flows. The resolution was not adopted, since it was just short of the number of votes required. Ten years have passed, the G20, like several Member States, is no longer ruling out the idea of such a tax, and above all, the financial crisis has served to remind us of the damage that volatile financial markets can cause. That is why I welcome the adoption by a wide margin of the resolution on taxes on financial transactions. This is only a small step, but the message is clear. Parliament is calling on the Commission to finally take up the issue and to work on an implementation project. A tax such as this would have the twin advantage of helping to stabilise the markets and of generating huge revenues to help developing countries finance their adaptation to climate change and the fight against poverty. Objectors tell us that it will only be effective if it is global, but make a start we must, as some countries have done with the tax on flight tickets. A wait­and­see policy will get us nowhere.

The current generalised system of preferences (GSP) will soon be coming to an end. I voted in favour of the resolution, a specific aim of which is to involve Parliament fully in its revision by 2012. This trade regime enables 176 developing countries and regions to benefit from preferential access to the European market in exchange for their ratification of ILO conventions on social rights and of UN conventions on human rights. Its implementation is unsatisfactory, however. That is why we demand, before the revision, a report on the current state of ratification, implementation of the conventions, an impact assessment of the effects of the GSP during the period 2006­2009, the inclusion of a condition stipulating that 27 fundamental UN conventions must be implemented, and more transparent investigation processes – involving, in particular, regular consultation of Parliament. It is regrettable that, during this vote, an amendment calling for an investigation procedure to be carried out in Colombia concerning the numerous killings of trade unionists and the mass graves containing the bodies of hundreds of people killed in the region of La Macarena was not passed because of opposition from the right.

 Mr President, Commissioner, this agreement with Korea will be the first to truly implement the Global Europe strategy as an important agreement, and it ought therefore to be particularly exemplary because it will set a precedent. However, we note that, firstly, there is a problem concerning the information given to Parliament, particularly with regard to the safeguard clauses, then a problem concerning the method used, since we have already been told that it might be possible to implement temporary provisions or temporarily to implement the agreement without even waiting for Parliament’s assent, and finally, a problem concerning the clarity and transparency of the trade framework – this was raised by Mr Rinaldi – since, through the duty drawback, we could in fact have an agreement indirectly concluded with China. I believe we must be particularly clear about these free trade agreements. In addition, there is a consistency problem with regard to the aim of developing social and environmental standards. When it comes to compliance with social standards, we are, for example, a very long way from what the United States has negotiated in its agreement with Korea.

Mr President, Commissioner, you have stated your hope that Tunisia will make progress in the areas of democratic reform and freedom of expression. You are right to do so, since this is quite simply in line with the association agreement and with the commitments that Tunisia has made to the European Union. That is why I am very surprised by the comments made by both Mr Baudis and Mr Michel, which seem to be encouraging you to ignore this aspect of our relationship and our cooperation with Tunisia, and to ultimately abandon Article 2 of the association agreement. Moreover, there is a long way to go before these commitments are honoured, judging from the fate – as already mentioned by my colleague, Mrs Guillaume – of the independent journalist Taoufik Ben Brik, who has been in prison since last October, following a trial in which his lawyers and the procedure were in complete violation of the law. In addition to the unacceptable denial of his freedom, his health is deteriorating and his visiting rights have been restricted. I therefore ask you, Commissioner: does the Commission intend to intervene within the framework of the Association Council to demand Mr Ben Brik’s immediate release and to ensure that his situation and his state of health may be taken into account, at the very least on humanitarian grounds?

 Thank you, Minister, for your reply. I congratulate you on your initiative to hold this conference in Palma de Mallorca in March, as it will follow on from the conference held in Stockholm. The problem is that we have to contend with multinational companies; as you said, Europe has to take the lead in corporate social responsibility, but it also has to take the lead as regards the conduct of European companies located outside Europe. The problem is that these subsidiaries are separate legal entities. Are you prepared to envisage a legal instrument by which parent companies would be obliged to assume responsibility for the conduct of their subsidiaries located in other parts of the world when they fail to meet their obligations in relation to the environment or to respect for human or workers’ rights? Because, if this obligation is not imposed, European companies will slip through the net of this corporate social responsibility that Europe wishes to promote due to the conduct of their subsidiaries located elsewhere in the world.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate Mrs Joly on her work, on the report and also on taking into account the contributions of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, and, although we have again tabled some amendments, we see our contribution in the resolution that she has presented. For our group, the partnership between the European Union and the ACP countries is part of an historic commitment, which must retain all its specific characteristics, which must not be watered down, even by the need to comply with certain rules, such as those of the WTO. We are most concerned that this partnership should preserve, in particular, the consistency of all European Union policies – trade policy, budgetary policy – with objectives in the area of development, but also in relation to the promotion of peace, security and democracy and human rights in ACP countries. It is not a question of imposing a model, but of working with these countries to ensure their development, which must be sustainable development. From this point of view, it is very important for this revision to enable us to take into account new elements of the last five years: the fight against climate change, technology transfers, renewable energy development aid, the fight against food crises, and therefore greater emphasis in our cooperation on agriculture, on food sovereignty, the fight against financial deregulation, good fiscal governance and the fight against tax havens. We see our contribution in all of that. I would like to stress two points. Trade: with the implementation of the Economic Partnership Agreements, certain provisions of the Cotonou Agreement will become obsolete, but we are concerned that this agreement should still mention that the trade clauses and the trade regimes from which the ACP countries benefit must not be less favourable than those from which they benefited previously. It seems to us that we should integrate the GSP, the interim EPAs and all these provisions in the revision of the Cotonou Agreement. Finally, on emigration – our colleagues in the group will emphasise this – we are concerned that it should actually be said that the migration agreements preserve the rights of migrants and that we cannot accept transit regimes to countries that do not guarantee respect for human rights.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Doha talks were opened in 2001 to correct the imbalances, in fact the injustices, of the international trade system that was introduced following the Uruguay Round, when the WTO was created. It was thus acknowledged that the Uruguay Round had not kept all the promises it had made concerning developing countries, and that the countries of the South were at an unfair disadvantage where trade rules were concerned, particularly in the field of agriculture, because these trade rules allow the richest countries both to protect their market and to continue to fund their production, including that intended for export, bankrupting many farmers of the South in the process. Cotton has come to symbolise this situation. In opening the ‘development round’, the WTO members have therefore committed themselves to amending multilateral trade rules in order to ensure that trade really does benefit economic and social development in every country, on every continent. Thus we should always remember that this round of negotiations is not a round like any other, and that, even if, as in all negotiations, everyone is waiting for progress to be made on the issues that concern them – for industrialised countries, that means industrial products and services – it was agreed, from the outset, that this round was, first and foremost, about restoring the balance in favour of developing countries. Today, in the wake of the Seventh Ministerial Conference, as before it, negotiations have essentially stalled on the slopes of Capitol Hill in Washington, just as they sank, in the past, in the sands of Cancún, and, back then, this was largely due to the demands made by the European Union. Having demanded too much during the negotiations, industrialised countries have thus jeopardised the final outcome of the round of negotiations and the credibility even of the WTO. Everyone is focusing solely on personal goals instead of on the overall goal, which is to create a multilateral trade framework that is based on fairer rules to encourage fairer trade, and which promotes sustainable development and the eradication of poverty. The first outcome of this stalemate is the increase in bilateral trade agreements, which are often even more unfavourable to the countries of the South. This is a step backwards. The European Union must therefore adopt a clear position. The priority is to conclude this round as a development round and not to try to outdo one another where industrial products and services are concerned. These negotiations must not be approached in a conventional and narrow-minded manner, where everyone is simply out for themselves. This leads to a deadlock and makes one lose sight of the main issue: the need to create a new way of regulating the international trade system that will form part of the new global governance that everyone has called for, particularly since the G20, in order to address the real challenges of today, which are fair development on all continents, the eradication of poverty, food security, respect for social rights and decent work, and the fight against climate change. During these negotiations, the European Union must show what it is doing to ensure that trade rules will help improve this situation in the future. It is on this basis that each of the following points of discussion must be considered: – on agriculture: honouring the July 2008 commitments; concluding the negotiations on procedures; guaranteeing, in particular, special and differential treatment, respect for special products, and safeguard mechanisms; developing agricultural support in accordance with sustainable agriculture and food security; – on NAMA products: asking developing countries for tariff reductions – I am finishing here – that are in line with their level of development; and – on services: protecting the right of every country to continue to regulate its public services.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 28 September, the people of Guinea took to the streets to appeal for the commitments that had been made to be honoured, and for free and democratic elections to be held, as promised. They have suffered the worst possible repression by a regime that was already devoid of all legitimacy and which, that day, lost all dignity. Men were repressed, women were disembowelled with bayonets, and raped, and the political opponents and trade unionists were tortured and maimed. The European Union must today support the African Union, ECOWAS and the United Nations in refusing to allow this crime to go unpunished and, above all, in showing solidarity towards the Guinean population. This country, which has an abundance of assets, will never be able to use them for its development as long as corrupt dictatorships can seize them for the benefit of a clan. That is why I welcome the firm approach announced by the European Commission, one which our Parliament is able to demonstrate today. We cannot weigh strict economic interests against the commitments that were made by the European Union’s partners, particularly those who signed the Cotonou Agreement, concerning respect for human rights and respect for democratic principles. Today we have a commitment to the people of Guinea: to support them in their fight for freedom and democracy. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation between Europe and the United States is crucial in resolving most of the major crises in the world, and the new US administration certainly provides an opportunity. It has already taken some initiatives that have marked a break with the past: in Iraq, on Guantánamo, on the anti-missile shield. It would be naïve, however, to think that that will be enough to make US and European points of view identical in all situations, and that transatlantic relations will now be very simple. Whether on preparations for Copenhagen or aid to developing countries, on Doha and protectionism, on financial regulation and combating tax havens, on the relaunch of the peace process in the Middle East or a firm policy on the nuclear issue in Iran, the US is extremely unwilling to take action. This goes beyond the issue of whether or not the administration has good intentions, and often relates to the influence of lobby groups on Congress, or simply the defence of its interests by a great power which is being shaken by the new world order. All these spheres will only make progress if Europe plays its proper political role as a separate global player, in a partnership of equals – to use the Commissioner's expression – and fully assumes its responsibilities. From this viewpoint, I must say that there is a certain confusion in the European attitude and sometimes even a certain naivety, and that this also extends to Parliament. The approach being taken to the idea of a large transatlantic market, which was Sir Leon Brittan’s hare-brained scheme back when he was Commissioner, poses certain risks. This affair of barriers to trade is being tackled as if the problems were only of a technical nature. Naturally, economic and commercial trade between the United States and Europe is important for jobs and for businesses. It ought to be developed. First of all, however, trade is not really in danger. Secondly, when there is a conflict, either it relates to defending our economic interests – for example, as in Airbus – or it poses a risk to our health or environmental rules – in the case of beef containing hormones, for instance, or chlorinated chicken – and we should therefore not prioritise the improvement of economic relations over our own internal model, our social model, our environmental model, or development model, as if economic relations were an end in themselves. We must be able to combine the two, and we should not surrender our political autonomy in search of a partnership that is, in itself, a commendable objective. Harlem Désir  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two Member States – France and the United Kingdom – have announced their intention to send to Afghanistan refugees who came to Europe in an attempt to save their own lives. I do not believe that we can continue to stand back in the face of this very serious threat to their lives. The British newspaper, The Guardian
, reported in October that some Afghan refugees expelled from Australia had been killed upon their arrival in their country. I believe that all of this goes completely against all of our international commitments. The European Commission itself said in an action plan dated June 2008 that legitimate measures to reduce illegal immigration should not result in refugees being denied access to protection within the European Union, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has warned the European Union against making any attempt to undermine the Geneva Convention and the other additional forms of protection that are designed to ensure that Afghan refugees are not deported to Afghanistan. A large number of MEPs, from four different groups, have signed an appeal along these lines. I call on you, Mr President, to talk to the European Commission, the United Kingdom and France, and our House, our Chamber, must take up this issue in order to prevent this crime against the right of asylum from being committed.

 Madam President, the excellent report by Mr Lange has three positive features. Firstly, it proposes an integrated industrial strategy for the European Union; that is to say, a strategy at once continental and cooperative, which differs in all respects from the narrowly national and non-cooperative policies in operation in Europe for the last 15 years. Secondly, this industrial strategy is financed, which is in marked contrast to the 2000 Lisbon strategy. If it were not financed, it would remain empty words. The main source of this funding is EU project bonds, Eurobonds and euro projects. In voting this morning, we faced up to that. Thirdly, this strategy protects our industries. This report is for opening up Europe; it is against giving it away. It is for exchanges founded on reciprocity and balance. Several articles focus on these issues. This is absolutely crucial because, in this area, we appear naive and weak. Henri Weber  (S&amp;D

Madam President, for such an important debate, I would have liked Baroness Ashton to have been present or at least one Member of the Council. Good for China! It has decided to lead the way in green technology; 38% of its massive recovery plan has been invested into these new industries. It is already the number one producer and biggest exporter of solar panels and wind turbines in the world. We would be only too delighted with this new direction, which can help reduce pollution levels in China and world-wide, were production to be carried out in accordance with WTO rules. However, that is not the case. Chinese exporting companies receive massive aid from state banks and local authorities. Although some green technology markets are open to foreign companies and foreign investment, many remain restricted in terms of quotas and some are even closed. Our European industries are under threat in the light of such unfair competition. Commissioner, China has signed WTO agreements. The European Union must ensure that it adheres strictly to the rules.

Mr President, the European Union has many tools to make it a global leader in the manufacture of clean cars and, in particular, of electric cars. The Commission must ensure that this project is a major European objective by encouraging the large car companies on our continent to cooperate with one another, with such cooperation extending from research and development to marketing. It must encourage the widespread installation of accessible and interoperable charging points in Europe, starting with urban areas. It must draft and enforce common rules and standards – if possible, at international level, but certainly at European level – and it must do so without delay. Lastly, it must encourage the Member States to gradually replace their fleet of combustion vehicles with electric cars. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the ban on removing the fins of sharks on board vessels. This practice has been prohibited in the EU since 2003, but some shipowners benefiting from exemptions in Spain and Portugal are suspected of ‘finning’, which involves cutting off a shark’s fin and throwing its flesh back into the water. The report therefore plans to force all fishermen to wait until their vessels have landed before cutting off sharks’ fins. This debate is a perfect illustration of the need to establish a real European fisheries control policy. The practice of ‘finning’ is unacceptable, but there is no proof that it takes place in Europe. However, in view of the doubt, it was necessary to remove any possibility of the continuation of such practices. Since controls have failed, the European Parliament has been forced to eliminate all exemptions, which will not be without consequences for professionals. The challenge now is to ensure that the issue of European fisheries control is dealt with more effectively. In particular, uniformity of controls must be promoted and the resources allocated to this vital tool for our fisheries policy must be increased. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 As shadow rapporteur for this report, I was involved in defining artisanal fishing. This term features repeatedly in texts on the common fisheries policy reform, without appearing to fit the definition established by the Commission. Indeed, the latter admits to having opted for a simplistic definition – currently, all vessels measuring 12 metres or less. However, this fails completely to take account of the diverse nature of European fishing. Given that small operators have more difficulty in gaining access to European funding, a new definition may be required to ensure fairer distribution of this funding. To that end, classification as a micro-, small or medium-sized enterprise and the skipper-on-board requirement appear to be more appropriate criteria. Even if Parliament has not come up with a final definition of artisanal fishing, this report should be welcomed for anticipating the discussions on the financing of fisheries and for wisely acknowledging that there is not one single criterion but a whole range of criteria for defining artisanal fishing.

 I voted in favour of the Lövin report, an own-initiative response to the Commission communication on the external dimension of the common fisheries policy. In the context of a CFP reform in which European fishing rules are becoming ever stricter, this report seeks to promote a sustainable fisheries policy beyond the EU’s borders, so as to protect European fisheries from unfair competition, by proposing that fishery products imported into the European Union should be subject to standards aligned with our own as regards environmental and social sustainability. Fish have no concept of borders. The European Union’s efforts to exploit fish stocks sustainably will be in vain, therefore, if we do not make sure to apply these requirements worldwide. By tackling the issue of the common fisheries policy reform in a global context, this report serves, in its own way, to foreshadow part of the substance of the future CFP. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, the debates on fisheries at this part-session each herald, in their own way, part of the structure of the future common fisheries policy. As architects of this policy, we must always bear in mind that each pillar of sustainable development affects the balance and solidity of that structure. In other words, the fisheries policy must at the same time be economically viable, safeguard jobs and preserve resources. These five reports put the main objectives of the future CAP to the test: maximum sustainable yield, reducing rejects and allocating fishing rights. These objectives cannot be mere slogans, however. Consequently, the technical measures in the Gallagher report, despite being only transitional, highlight the difficulties involved in moving to practical cases, fishery by fishery, stock by stock. The Ferreira report on artisanal fishing rightly recognises that there is not one criterion, but a range of criteria, for defining artisanal fishing. The Gróbarczyk report highlights the lack of data. The Lövin report on the external dimension points out that we are evolving in a global context and looks at the conditions for the exploitation of resources outside European waters as well as the import conditions to ensure fair trade. We cannot allow the restrictions imposed on our fishermen to continue without balancing them with import restrictions to prevent unfair competition. Finally, the Patrão Neves report on sharks emphasises, in particular, the urgent need for stronger EU controls. The success of an ambition cannot just be declared: it requires patient, meticulous work between goals and resources. That is what we are trying to do. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report on protecting children in the digital world. The digital world is a great tool for communication, information and education. However, children today are accessing this world at an increasingly young age. Parents are not always able to protect them in this enlightening but complex universe, where there are dangers such as commercial targeting, sexual abuse, bullying on social networks, etc. I supported this report because it will allow greater coordination of actions at European level. Education about digital media, tackling illegal content and content harmful to minors, protection of privacy and the right of reply will help to protect children. This report has successfully brought together two important principles: protecting children and defending freedoms. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 The Erasmus programme has proved its worth by enabling millions of young people to go and study in another country, improve their qualifications, learn a foreign language and discover another culture. The scheme contributes to European integration but also to the personal integration of young Europeans. Anything that came in its way would be a step backwards at a time when citizens are having their doubts about the EU and our young people are having doubts about the future. The programme is now a victim of the short-term vision of some Member States that, in the name of defending liberal dogma, are endangering one of the EU’s tools for investing in the future, that of training and that of youth. Discussions on the 2012 and 2013 budgets are well on the way to overcoming this deadlock, but this should not be disconnected from the negotiations under way on the financial framework for 2014-2020. The proposal of a freeze on the EU’s budget is unacceptable when we are promoting education and qualifications as the main assets in the fight against unemployment, particularly of young people. On the contrary, a substantial increase in the EU budget is necessary to get through the crisis and prepare for the future. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

I voted for the report on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources, a report voted on unanimously in plenary, which was a historic moment! The report itself presented no problems. The access regime to the current zone of 12 nautical miles, which is managed and controlled by the Member States, is one of the CFP measures introduced in 2002 that has been the most widely supported by stakeholders, and the effectiveness of which is undisputed. The report voted on in plenary only had the effect of extending the time limit of the regime until 31 December 2014, after which it was expected to be brought into line with the CFP reform currently under way by means of a new regulation. The vote was unanimous because certain questions raised by the committee were not addressed, such as the proposal to extend the derogation in coastal zones beyond the current limit. In order to avoid any further extension, the rapporteur also proposed that the regime should be extended indefinitely. These questions will of course be discussed in more detail when the future regulation is adopted, which is expected to cover a period of 10 years. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to support Peugeot employees. Almost EUR 12 million will be released for the 2 089 workers who were made redundant by Peugeot. These funds will be used to finance active reintegration measures additional to those required by virtue of French law and to help the workers to find new jobs. However, I regret that this support for Peugeot employees is one of the EGF’s last on the basis of the ‘crisis’ criterion and that access to the Fund will be restricted in the future. At a time when the recession and unemployment explosion are hitting European countries, the Council has unfortunately decided that this ‘crisis’ criterion may no longer be invoked to mobilise the EGF.

 I voted for the report on the minimum level of training for seafarers. The European Parliament had limited room for manoeuvre, since the Member States had already accepted the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW). These changes constitute progress on training and the harmonisation of the issue of certificates of competency. They also improve the prevention of fraudulent practices and the standards applied in respect of fitness to work, medical requirements and requirements concerning alcohol abuse. In a sector which operates without borders, it is in the interests of seafarers, as well as in the general interest, for the certificates issued by Member States and third countries to be recognised everywhere in Europe. However, to avoid a ‘race to the bottom’, it is necessary to ensure that a certain number of strict common criteria remain in place. We can be satisfied that this is the case. I also welcome the Commission’s initiative of obliging Member States to communicate the available information on certificates, an appropriate provision which will help establish an overall picture of the current state of affairs and a strategy for employment in the sector.

 I voted in favour of the report on measures taken for the purpose of the conservation of fish stocks in relation to countries allowing non-sustainable fishing. The content of this report is crucial, as it seeks to ensure fair competition between European fishermen and third countries. Faced with an ambitious European legislation to protect fish stocks, we must be given a guarantee that our fishing activity is not relocatable at lower environmental costs. This report mentions the option to restrict imports of fishery products originating from countries allowing non-sustainable fishing, to restrict the provision of port services to vessels flying the flag of those countries or to prevent Union fishing vessels from fishing the stock of common interest under the responsibility of the country allowing non-sustainable fishing. However, I note with regret that the report is entirely conditional, so I hope the European Commission will be quick to make a legally binding proposal on this matter. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted for the report on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products, although it would have been a better idea to put it to the vote after the adoption of the basic Regulation on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The progress achieved by the vote is patchy. On the negative side: this report provides for a market of landed by-catch, and yet this landing has not yet been agreed in the basic regulation. It is, however, necessary to have at our disposal a legal framework, without pre-empting any means which will be implemented to limit, or even eliminate, by-catches. I was, on the other hand, very much in favour of Parliament recognising the need to put European funding for the storage mechanism on a sustainable basis and agreeing to create an eco-label. Producer organisations have also been given greater power and recognition, and can, in particular, become transnational. Finally, the report supports the development of aquaculture, a development that I support providing that we bear in mind that this activity is complementary to fishing and must be set within a framework of strict environmental standards, without promoting the creation of a fish meal market.

 I voted in favour of the report on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources. This own-initiative report is satisfactory because it has allowed us to move the debate on the common fisheries policy (CFP) forward, particularly by highlighting the consensus in Parliament on the need to improve data collection, an essential prerequisite if we are to arrive at a sound definition of the CFP’s objectives at a time when the status of some fish stocks is still unknown. However, it is only one vote in the process. This report also points out the need to go in the direction of greater decentralisation, at a time, in particular, when the Commission has stated that there are too many ships in the European fleet compared with available fish stocks. Yet it does not study the realities of each coastline and the different fish stocks found there. The report also notes that one of the prime priorities of the CFP should be jobs, because without fish, there is no fishing, and without fishermen, neither is there any fishing. Finally, Parliament has noted that transferable fishing concessions should be an optional management measure, and recognised that the obligation to land by-catch should be adjusted to the realities of each fishery.

 I voted in favour of the overarching communication on the common fisheries policy (CFP). This non-binding report is acceptable insofar as its content anticipates and influences forthcoming debates on the basic CFP Regulation. It has enabled us to make some progress on the Commission’s proposals, which is important for future negotiations, and which, I hope, will allow for further improvements. In the face of the EU’s very controversial proposal to introduce transferable fishing concessions, a tool for liberalising the fishing industry, Parliament spoke in particular in favour of a voluntary system, allowing Member States to decide whether to implement it or not, which is an encouraging start. Parliament also noted that we should reach the maximum sustainable yield by 2020, and not exceed it, a notion thought to be too vague. The proposal to land all by-catches, which the industry has great difficulty in implementing because of technical constraints, has also been watered down, in favour of a gradual implementation on a case-by-case basis, depending on the characteristics and realities of the different fisheries. There should be further discussion about the technical feasibility of implementing such a measure. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report on the sulphur content of marine fuels. With this directive, the EU is making provision for a reduction in the sulphur content of ship emissions to 0.1% by 2015 in the Baltic Sea, the English Channel and the North Sea. It therefore transposes into EU law an obligation required by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), which was difficult to ignore. The 2015 deadline, however, seems very premature given the economic and technical constraints that it will impose, especially on passenger shipping. The fear is that some ships will have to be withdrawn from the fleets, as there will be no way of adapting them to the new requirements, leading to the loss of hundreds of jobs in an economic context where passenger transport companies are facing difficulties. Negotiations in Parliament have, however, allowed us to confirm that State aid would be authorised to support the operators in this transition. There is also a reminder that Member States can still approach the IMO for an extension to deadlines to allow their fleets to be fitted out within the deadlines. These different safeguard measures have led me to approve the transposition of the European Union’s international obligations in this directive. Isabelle Thomas  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report on Education, Training and Europe 2020. Education and training are crucial elements in achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and ensuring the future growth of Europe. The current economic difficulties must not be used as an excuse to reduce the resources set aside for education and training. In order to guarantee the investments for the future, the Socialists proposed excluding investments in education and training from the national deficit calculation of the fiscal compact. As the report points out, dropping out of school early has a higher cost than the crisis. There is thus no point in making short-term savings that would compromise future growth. For the same reasons, we encourage the Member States to devote at least 2% of their GDP to higher education in order to ensure a knowledge-based economy. However, additional efforts are required in the area of early childhood education and schooling, which is a crucial stage in the development of our future workers and citizens.

 We are preparing to vote on a number of texts that will define the future of European fishing. These texts affect hundreds of thousands of jobs, our food autonomy, the preservation of fish resources and the durability of an economic sector. Despite the fact that these major issues are evidently of general interest, the Commission has given its draft reform a very liberal slant. Parliament’s work has, of course, toned down these proposals. It is just a first step, however. Future work must go beyond declarations of intent. From now on, we have to build real tools to achieve an economic, social and environmental balance for this activity, in accordance with the EU’s 2020 strategy. It is just as essential to preserve jobs as it is to preserve resources. We urgently need to establish homogeneous controls throughout the Union. Similarly, we can no longer use different methods to collect scientific data. The renewal of the fleet is essential for the emergence of a future fishing sector that is more selective, safer, cleaner, and more efficient and thus more profitable. Otherwise, we will be left with one question: is the fisheries policy an exception to the 2020 strategy? Kader Arif,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we have just heard, the question of public procurement reform is a fundamental one for Europe, particularly at this time of crisis. European rules are generally focused on the criterion of price, which means that our businesses are helpless in the face of foreign operators that do not hesitate to practise social and economic dumping in order to win public procurement contracts in Europe. That is why it is essential to recognise additional criteria, including in the WTO agreement on government procurement. In the debate that I led in the Committee on International Trade, I stressed the need to reform that agreement and to extend it to new countries, particularly emerging ones. However, the creation of new instruments is also urgently required. In particular, we need an effective and binding tool for establishing a greater degree of reciprocity with countries that do not offer equivalent access to European operators. Since the Commissioner has brought it up, I should also like to receive more details about the legislative proposal that is being drafted. Lastly, we need to create an instrument for supervising buyouts of European businesses by foreign capital, in particular, by sovereign funds. This is a solution that has already been applied by the United States through an ad hoc
 committee and which ensures the protection of this strategic sector. Europe, which can be naive or weak when faced with its foreign competitors, would be well advised to take inspiration from it. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, aside from the work which Mr Caspary has done, I find that the new trade strategy proposed by the Commission does not address the challenges which Europe has to face in light of the financial, economic, social, environmental and food crises we are experiencing, nor does it address the expectations of our fellow citizens who are calling for stronger regulation and for a new sustainable growth and development model for the planet. Unfortunately, however, this does not or no longer comes as a surprise. Faced with these calls for new regulation and new solidarity, the Union must establish a new doctrine for an alternative trade policy. If Europe does not advocate a fairer form of trade that is founded on the values of justice and that generates quality employment in both Europe and the rest of the world, who will? Solely promoting services is not a policy. We need to preserve strong industrial and agricultural sectors through an employment-generating industrial policy and an updated CAP. The inclusion in all of our free trade agreements of social and environmental standards, and stringent human rights rules which guarantee decent working conditions, is fundamental. Europe must lead the way in balancing trade openness with room for public intervention and the legitimate protection of various economic sectors both in Europe and in its partner countries – a fair trade policy for fair trade should be the aim.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ever since the United Nations General Assembly agreed to create two states on the territory that formerly constituted the Palestine Mandate in 1947, we have never stopped waiting for that commitment to be realised. So how can we now accept the caution expressed in the speeches? In the light of this historic opportunity, how can we justify refusing to back President Abbas’s request fully? Let me remind you, Baroness Ashton, that sometimes caution can result in cowardice. I would therefore like to pay tribute to the courage and perseverance of one man, Mahmoud Abbas. He is the bearer of a legitimate hope, that of a people who have a right to a land. For those who object to the fact that this initiative could provoke an outbreak of violence, let me remind you that a few years ago, the suppression of a similar initiative fostered the Second Intifada. My message is simple, Baroness Ashton: at the time of the Arab Spring, it is your duty and ours to support the Palestinian request to the hilt. The European Union boasts of having brought down a wall and of recognising states. It will be able to stand even prouder if it recognises that the Palestinians are also entitled to statehood.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am even wearing a flower-patterned shirt to symbolise the Arab Spring. Who could have expected, a few months ago, this wind of change energised by the universal values of democracy and which is now blowing on the southern shores of the Mediterranean and more widely on the Arab world? No one. Certainly not most European leaders who have been urging us for years to enter into agreements of all kinds with dictatorial regimes for the sake of Europe’s interests. Today, I say to myself that it is never too late to show courage and dignity – the courage to say to our people that there is no Muslim horde about to sweep across Europe, but that there is a young population who, paying with their blood, want to see democracy irreversibly established, and want Europe to be a partner who helps them, so that the rule of law is no longer an illusion but becomes a reality. Tunisia and Egypt are currently in a situation of emergency. There is not enough time here for me to give an overview of the countries where there are uprisings. However, I do want to vigorously condemn with all my heart, here before you, the atrocities committed by the Gaddafi regime in Libya and the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. Naturally, this condemnation is directed at all countries where the word ‘repression’ is opposed to the word ‘freedom’. In moments like these, even if history is sometimes cruel, the international community – of which you are one of the dignitaries, Madam – should react so as to show support to and solidarity with the peoples who have taken up the struggle, but also to condemn in the strongest possible way, and in all instances, all these contemptible regimes and all the countries that do not comply with international law or with United Nations resolutions. In your communication of 25 May, you mentioned this support. I know that this is one of your priorities. However, I urge you, Baroness Ashton, even if this means devoting all your energy, to move from appeasing words to constructive solutions. I would not wish to see, as the only response to this Arab Spring which is changing the face of the world, a European winter where narrow-mindedness sets in, borders close and walls come up.

 I voted against the resolution tabled by the European right, as it promotes an ultraliberal vision of the EU’s trade relations with India. The right systematically opposed the amendments that I tabled on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament in order to rule out any liberalisation of public services, strongly condemn child labour, request legally binding clauses on corporate social responsibility and demand respect for the principle of equal pay for equal work with regard to Indians who will come and work in Europe in the future. The compromise was impossible, the differences of opinion obvious and irreconcilable. Only the resolution tabled by my group, together with those by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, offered a progressive vision of EU-India trade relations. Unsurprisingly, it could not hold out against the right-wing majority in Parliament, which is a shame. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 In anticipation of the EU-Japan Summit at the end of the month, Parliament has adopted this resolution stating its views on trade relations between the two partners. Unlike the European right, which spoke out very strongly in favour of opening negotiations on the conclusion of a free trade agreement, I defended a more cautious approach. Japan is a trade power that needs to be approached with caution when it comes to trade liberalisation. That is why my group opposed the present text presented by the European right and stressed the need to launch specific impact studies assessing the consequences of stronger trade relations for all the sectors concerned (in particular, the automotive sector) and for employment in Europe, before we open any negotiations. At the same time, we emphasised the problem of non-tariff barriers, which prevent European businesses from accessing Japanese public contracts. Indeed, it is wrong that the European Union, the region in the world that is most open to foreign investment, cannot operate on the markets of its industrialised partners under fair conditions.

 In the wake of the floods that devastated Pakistan in 2010, the Council called for emergency measures to support the country. I tabled an amendment rejecting the regulation proposed by the Commission, as trade preferences of this nature are a good idea in theory but not in practice. Our response to a humanitarian crisis cannot be based on trade, especially considering that it is now one year on from the disaster and the urgency is not as strong. This type of support is illogical and prejudicial, as some people in Europe, in particular those working in the textiles industry in several of the southern countries, will end up paying for support for Pakistan that we should all be paying for collectively. Furthermore, by only targeting certain industries, we are not helping all Pakistanis. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Since the Treaty of Lisbon, investment has been an area of exclusive EU competence. Parliament therefore initially gave its verdict on the shape of the future European investment policy. This is the report I myself drafted, which was voted on during the last part-session in April 2011. In Mr Schlyter’s report, Parliament has now examined transitional arrangements for managing investment agreements that Member States have already concluded with third countries. As in the vote in committee, I advocated a Community vision and stated that agreements that were already standing should be closely examined by the Commission in order to check their compatibility with the Treaties and with Union law and Union policy, in particular the objectives of the Union’s external action on sustainable development. However, the vision that has prevailed in the end is a right-wing vision in which protection of private investors is given priority over these objectives based on the general interest. Unfortunately the negotiations that will now be entered into with the Council are not likely to correct our aim, in an EU in which the good of the Union as a whole is rarely able to withstand national egotism.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by sincerely thanking all those with whom I have had the opportunity to work on this issue. All the contributions have helped in the drafting of this report and, thanks to the cooperation of all the political groups, and I am especially grateful to the shadow rapporteurs, we have on the table today a consistent text that sends out a powerful message. Indeed, we are at a turning point in European investment policy and at a time when we have to seize the new power conferred on us by the Treaty of Lisbon in order to meet a dual challenge. Firstly, that of providing European businesses with the tools they need for high quality foreign investment that is protected by a legal framework providing long-term support. Secondly, Europe must strengthen its position as the world’s leading beneficiary of foreign direct investment and give itself the means to control that investment so as to encourage sustainable development that creates high quality employment. By voting on this report, the first official expression of our institution since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, Parliament is fully assuming its role as a new colegislator in trade regulatory matters and is voicing its priorities at a time when the first investment protection negotiations are about to begin. This expression is essential, because it is intended to relay the concerns of the citizens, who are showing a growing interest in trade matters and whom we must support. In a world, today, where conflicts also take place in a trade context, protecting those businesses of ours that invest abroad must become a priority. International agreements have been created to protect investors from harsh, unjustified expropriations and hidden laws aimed simply at eliminating them from this or that market. This primary objective must be maintained. Although Europe is one of the most open markets in the world, a balance must be restored with our main partners so that European businesses can benefit from a level playing field. This is the proposal made in this report, which stresses the need for future agreements to include standards relating to non-discrimination, fair and equitable treatment, and protection against direct and indirect expropriation. However, those standards must be defined in such a way as to prevent any misinterpretation. Some businesses have, in fact, used the vague wording in first-generation investment agreements to protect their interests beyond what is legitimate, for example, by attacking new social and environmental laws that harm their interests. Appearing before international arbitrators and with no transparency or possibility of appeal, they have demanded considerable compensation by claiming that those laws are on a par with indirect expropriation. Europe, which, in the future, will receive ever more investment, particularly from emerging countries, must guard against such abuses. That is the idea behind the reforms undertaken by the United States and Canada, two countries whose governments and authorities have suffered several setbacks in international arbitration cases and which have radically overhauled their investment agreement model. By proposing new definitions of protection standards, the report strikes a fair balance between the protection of investors’ rights and the right of public authorities to regulate. This also means including in all future agreements specific clauses laying down the possibility for public authorities to legislate and regulate in the areas of national security, the environment, public health, workers’ and consumers’ rights, industrial policy and cultural diversity. Lastly, increased protection for investors must be accompanied by more responsible behaviour, particularly in developing countries, where the social and environmental laws are less binding. That is why the report mentions that social and environmental clauses should be included in all free trade agreements signed by the Union. Furthermore, we must go beyond naming and shaming and include in all future agreements a set of clear corporate social responsibility rules with which businesses must comply and which are based on guidelines set by the OECD. If our aim here really is to shape the contours of a new European investment policy, then I call in this report for it to be exemplary and to promote investment which is sustainable, respects the environment and encourages good quality working conditions in Europe and in third countries alike. That is why this report, by the power vested in it by Wednesday’s vote, must serve as a reference for all future negotiations conducted by the Commission. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first allow to me to express the regret that it took a crisis in Europe to trigger the debate we are having today and the motion for a resolution we will vote on tomorrow. Just last year, when the developing countries rose up in what was called the ‘food riots’, Europe simply proposed emergency response measures, that is, to send seedlings and fertilisers, as though the problem were cyclical, when we have long been warning of structural problems. We have a common agricultural policy (CAP) that lacks effective regulatory mechanisms because the liberal majority still believes that nothing must restrict the market. There is widespread, economically destabilising and morally unacceptable speculation on agricultural products of developing countries that are prisoners of single-crop farming for export, with a Europe that does not support them and allocates only 4% of its development aid to the agricultural sector. With this resolution, Parliament as a whole finally acknowledges that the right to food is a basic human right, that it is unacceptable that the hunger of some is exploited for the benefit of others, that regulation is indispensable in ensuring price stability, and that trade agreements must preserve small family farms and the right to food. Today, Parliament is delivering a clear message. It is up to the Commission and the Council to translate it. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, it can never be said often enough that what is happening in the southern Mediterranean and, more generally, in the Arab world, is historic, especially for those peoples who, half a century after their countries gained independence through decolonisation, are today gaining their individual and collective freedoms. It is historic, but also unexpected, as are all popular revolutions, I hear you say. However, this new situation requires us to totally rethink our vision, our policies and our relationships with these countries. Proposals have been made. Indeed, the caution with which we have reacted to date is easily and worryingly explained by our obsession with stability, by which I mean that safety-first approach fuelled by our fears, an approach of which the sole priorities were the fight against immigration, terrorism and radical Islam, along with some economic interests, not least access to energy. We accepted authoritarian regimes, when their sole aim was to confirm our fears. The people’s revolt has made the failure of our policies plain to see; we no longer have the right to go on basing our analyses on the same fears, or, worse still, the same xenophobia-tinged beliefs. That is why we must stand side by side with those who aspire to greater freedom and democracy, in places where it is possible to be Muslim, democratic and secular. That is the message that we are being sent. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, until now I had suspected that peoples were always ahead of their political elites. Today I am quite sure of this. May I first of all pay tribute to the courage and determination of the Tunisian and Egyptian peoples. They have reminded us that the values that we stand for in the world – human rights and democracy – are not values exclusive to the West, as some proclaim, but rather are universal values shared by all. Europe, in my view, can no longer continue to make mistakes in this part of the world, shilly-shallying as it does from wrong analyses to misguided projects. These peoples are expecting a response from us that is equal to their courage and aspirations. They are not asking for charity but they are certainly asking for solidarity, and even more so for responsibility. In these uncertain times, nobody wants chaos, but nobody should have to accept the status quo any longer, either. We must support the hope created by the events in Tunisia and Egypt in order to help affirm and establish democracies that will benefit these countries and their populations, but which will also benefit us, and I believe that you have expressed this forcefully, Baroness Ashton. I shall conclude by quoting what a poet once said: ‘The world sleeps from a lack of imprudence.’ These peoples, quite rightly, have been imprudent in calling for their freedom, but I hope above all that they will have awakened our consciences. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the elections in Côte d'Ivoire have just taken place. The international community tolerated their being postponed year after year by the regime of Laurent Gbagbo. These successive reports alerted a number of us to the difficulties in which we find ourselves at the moment but, deep within ourselves, we hoped that the democratic spirit would prevail in a country that has suffered a great deal from sterile and unacceptable confrontations focused, in particular, around the concept of Ivorian nationality. The international community and, in particular, the European Union around Baroness Ashton and through my fellow Member, Mr Preda, mobilized to ensure that these elections took place under the best possible conditions, transparently and without violence. This should be commended. In view of the calm that prevailed and the atmosphere of mutual respect among candidates, the electoral campaign gave us cause to hope that the result would be accepted by all the parties. Today, unfortunately, the democratic result that emerged through the ballot box has been rejected by the outgoing President. Tomorrow, like my fellow Members, I will therefore vote in favour of appealing to Mr Gbagbo to accept that what appears to him to be a reversal of fortune or a conspiracy is, in fact, simply the will of the majority of his citizens. He cannot hang on to power without calling into question part of his own militant history, which was to appear, when resident in Europe, as the man who had brought about the newly regained freedom and democracy established in his country. The United Nations representative in Côte d'Ivoire courageously assumed his role and announced the results of the ballot. As First Vice-President of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I would also like to point out that a declaration was adopted by our Assembly on 3 December in Kinshasa firmly condemning the decision of the Ivorian Constitutional Council for invalidating the results. This declaration comes on top of the clear and unambiguous position taken by the leaders of the Member States of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and of the African Union. Today, the regime of Mr Gbagbo is neither wanted by its citizens, nor supported by its neighbours, nor accepted by the international community. It is therefore time that he accepted the victory of Alassane Ouattara, the democratically elected President of Côte d'Ivoire, who must be in a position to take on the responsibility entrusted to him by his people as soon as possible. Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to conclude by asking the European Union to assume its role through the means at its disposal to persuade Laurent Gbagbo and his illegitimate government to accept that the game is over. We will not allow his obstinacy to lead to chaos in Côte d'Ivoire. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the title of this debate is likely to create a certain optimism because in theory, it is about defining the procedures for helping banana-producing ACP countries. The reality is entirely different, and I have to say that the way they have been treated throughout this report is quite simply unacceptable. We must first and foremost bear in mind the fact that the banana sector is vital for many African and Caribbean countries. Yet, despite this, they have made the effort to accept, at the WTO, an agreement which lowers the European customs tariff to EUR 114 per tonne, in order to put an end to a long-standing dispute with Latin American producer countries. However, the Commission seems to have forgotten to inform them of the bilateral negotiations under way with these same countries on a far lower tariff: EUR 75 per tonne. In other words, the commercial consequences of these agreements will be deeply felt in a context in which the lion’s share of the European banana market is already held by multinationals based in Latin America. Faced with this situation, during the last plenary session of the ACP-EU Assembly in Tenerife, all the members agreed to adopt as one a declaration calling for support measures tailored to producers’ needs to be implemented without delay. Back in Brussels and Strasbourg, I see that, unfortunately – and this is no surprise – the right is backtracking and even opposing any reference to this declaration. I am tired of this double-dealing, but, above all, I fear that this weariness is shared by our historical partners, who no longer believe in our will to truly support their development. Kader Arif,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am always very happy to speak after Mr Fjellner, as I am always sure that I will not be in agreement with him. First, I should like to thank our rapporteur as well as all the shadow rapporteurs and, in particular, my friend Mr Susta, for their excellent work and their good cooperation on this text, which will finally enable a system of compulsory marking of origin on certain products imported into Europe to be introduced. I should like to thank you too, Commissioner, for your commitment. Our vote tomorrow will, in fact, be the first stage in the introduction of this regulation, which dates from 2005, and which the European Parliament has always supported and called for. Origin marking is an important step towards transparency and information, which we must constantly improve in favour of European citizens. Indeed, European consumers rightly want to know what they are purchasing, where the product comes from and under what conditions it was produced. They are therefore demanding to be able to consume in a more informed and, hence, responsible way. With this new regulation, we are responding to this demand, because our citizens will be better informed, in particular, of the social and environmental conditions under which the goods they purchase are produced. Contrary to what some people want to believe, the consumer is also a citizen, who agrees to pay more for quality European production, because this legislation is also essential for European companies, whose production is associated with a reputation for quality and high production standards. For those companies that have chosen to maintain production safeguarding know-how and employment in Europe, this regulation will re-establish a level playing field with our third-country trading partners. The text resulting from the vote of the Committee on International Trade is balanced, which is why, when it is voted on in tomorrow’s plenary, I call on the Members of this House not to call this balance into question and to support this text by voting overwhelmingly in favour of it. Kader Arif,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are clearly faced with a text whose complexity troubles many of us and, even more, in my opinion, the citizens of Europe. Commissioner, I asked for transparency and you responded. Today, I am somewhat concerned. Indeed, as I see it, beyond the purely technical issues, the main risk is that of the direction we are beginning to take with regard to this increasingly complex relationship between individual freedoms and the Internet. The world is changing rapidly, and we are all aware of this. We are all aware of the revolution taking place in access not only to information but also to culture via this tool. In today’s world, where such access is immediate and free, traditional reference points are being undermined. Our most complex task is, therefore, to define new regulations, because regulation is necessary not only to protect artists and rights holders; but I do not want to see individual freedoms ignored. As regards the protection of freedoms, one of the most important of which is the protection of the right to privacy, one of my main concerns is the possibility afforded by the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) of travellers’ personal effects and baggage being checked at borders. Does this mean that our mobile telephones, our MP3 players and our computers may be searched by customs authorities looking for illegally downloaded files? According to the Commission, this is just a possibility, because the precise term used in the text is not binding. It is said that the Member States may choose whether or not to allow their personal luggage to be searched. However, let us get serious here for a minute. How can one expect such wording not to be seen as incitement to carry out such checks? Do you really think that a government, especially if it is pressurised to some extent by its music industry – and I cite this example deliberately – will not take this opportunity afforded by ACTA to move its national legislation towards increased screening of passengers entering its territory? Another problem is that, if it is proved that the files held by a private individual are for commercial use, punishment is automatic. However, who determines whether the files we hold are of a commercial nature or not? Some may say that a person with 500 songs on his or her MP3 player necessarily has commercial objectives, but why would others deny themselves the opportunity to fix this limit at 300, 100, 50 or 10? In fact, for an ill-intentioned person, all it takes is to illegally download a single film in order to make thousands of copies of it, and that then becomes commercial activity. Finally, punishment will be meted out by the courts of each country, but a European citizen arrested by the border authorities of a signatory country on the basis of particularly binding legislation will have no means of challenging it. Is it your wish that such an abuse be possible? Was it not the responsibility of the Commission precisely to do everything it could to ensure that the agreement prohibits searches of personal effects? I have deliberately raised only this issue this evening, but you have raised many more, which we will incorporate into the resolution I have requested and which will ordinarily be voted on in next month’s plenary. Commissioner, I would ask you to take account of the outcome of this vote, which will be in line with our commitment, that is, to take account of the word of the European Parliament before you sign the act. Kader Arif,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

Mr President, Commissioner, here we are, finally, after many months of work, aiming to lay the foundations for the European Union’s future External Action Service but, like some of my fellow Members before me, I should like to thank the rapporteurs for the quality of their work. Since our shared vision is to see a real European diplomatic service which is not just an extension of the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States, the Financial Regulation and Staff Regulations, which we will discuss today and vote on tomorrow, are of paramount importance. They must give us the means to face a dual challenge: speaking with one voice on the international stage, but also guaranteeing consistency in all the Union’s external policies. With this in mind, trade policy does not fall within the High Representative’s mandate, but as a former trade commissioner, I have no doubt that she can establish the dialogue which is needed to ensure that trade policy, as specified in the treaty, observes the goals of the Union’s External Action Service, in particular, sustainable development, eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights. Lastly, I should like to stress that our shared political will will be measured by the budgetary resources earmarked; our ability to have political punch on the international stage depends on it.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, and as has just been pointed out, the Treaty of Lisbon strengthens Parliament’s powers. However, few of us are aware of the radical change that it brings about, particularly in the field of trade policy, which I follow closely. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament will ratify all international trade agreements. This is already causing quite a stir, and the discussions on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and on the free trade agreement with Korea are merely a first sign of this. However, the socialists and democrats in the Committee on Trade wanted to go further than the treaty allows. I am their spokesperson, and despite the scepticism of some and the opposition shown by certain others, I conveyed a clear message: if Parliament is to ratify any trade agreement, it must be involved from the start of the process. What used to seem idealistic is now a core element of our relations with the Commission, since we will be fully consulted on the negotiating mandates. I welcome this. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to continue to respect the Community spirit and the democratic will that are at the heart of the treaty. I also call on my fellow Members – since we suffer from a kind of Stockholm syndrome where the Commission and the Council are concerned – to use all our rights, because they are the rights of our fellow citizens. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, please allow me to make a general remark about this report which, in my opinion, is a reflection of our relationship with Turkey. Although I must congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their work, what I mean to say is that it is ambiguous. It reflects our indecision with regard to that country. As, one by one, the amendments were adopted, or otherwise, within the Committee on International Trade, an underlying – almost subliminal – issue, but one which was largely outside the scope of economic and commercial relations with Turkey, kept emerging: are we for or against that country’s accession to the EU? They reflect a kind of hesitation, which has not been taken on board: should Turkey be regarded as just another third country with which commercial relations might well be developed, or as an accession candidate, which thus imposes particular obligations which must be fulfilled by both parties? It is indeed difficult to say today whether this report accurately reflects the reality of our relations with that country, and especially whether it actually defines an EU strategy in this regard. It depends on which side of the fence we stand: do we simply want a privileged partnership, or do we want Turkey to actually accede? I should simply like to warn against the contradictory signals we are sending out. We cannot maintain an ambiguous approach with regard to our common destiny while, at the same time, worrying that Turkey seems to be distancing itself from the EU. A partnership requires frankness but it also requires trust. It requires frankness, because Turkey does, in fact, still need to make a great deal of effort to ensure root and branch reform and fulfil its undertakings. However, it also requires trust, which itself requires us to provide encouragement and send out positive signals. When the Turks voted to reform their constitution a few days ago, they also did what the EU is asking of them: they are gradually bringing their legislation into conformity with our standards so that they can become a fully fledged Member State. There is still a long way to go and a great deal of effort to be made, but let us refrain from creating additional obstacles and diverting our relationship from its aim, which is membership.

 Mr President, I can still only see good things emerging from a reform such as this, which is always highly complex. The signal indicating that the army is less powerful and that democracy is moving forward is, for me, an important signal sent out to the EU. One can always criticise and believe that certain things have not been done, but a step forward is still a step forward. I am not a pessimist by nature, and I think that all the actions taken by Turkey are along the right lines and that it is expressing a desire to accede. Let us therefore try to support it.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you have just said some reassuring things, but I still do not think that the concerns shared by a large number of Members about the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) have been completely dispelled. Back in March, I proposed a resolution, which was passed by a large majority in this Chamber, and which made it possible to publish the negotiating text. During the debate, we called for the acquis communautaire
 – which you have referred to – the safety and supply of generic medicines to be guaranteed and the fundamental freedoms of our fellow citizens to be respected. We also referred to geographical indications, and we did so in order to tell you our priorities, which I am going to keep on repeating to you so that the position which you will defend in a few weeks’ time in Japan is based on the parliamentary debate which we have managed to initiate. Yesterday, during the debate on the State of the Union, many speakers quite rightly pointed out that we MEPs are the spokespeople for our fellow citizens and that, without this link, the Commission is in danger of engaging in a sterile confrontation with Parliament. I am therefore asking you, Commissioner, to consider, as a priority, that the MEPs before you are first and foremost your partners and are not here to simply contradict you. The partnership we want is not one in which we are bound, as your services sometimes seem to want, by a vow of secrecy. Your services have just answered our questions behind closed doors. We are given the latest version of the ACTA text but we are prohibited from sending any messages when we leave these meetings or after we have read the agreement, whereas our role is to alert, explain and ensure things are understood. This is therefore my second request for you to regard the transparency of debates as an element which enriches your deliberations rather than as a breakdown of trust. In addition to these two main issues, and because I am starting to become accustomed to this type of exercise, I am going to inform you of my concerns. First of all, there is access to medicines. This has been mentioned. You tell us that protecting access is one of your priorities, that you are doing everything possible to ensure that nothing in this agreement hinders their manufacture or free movement. At this point, however, I would ask you about patents. Why do you want to include them in this agreement? The desire to step up the legitimate fight against counterfeiting should not be a pretext for using ACTA as a means of extending the rights of patentees way beyond what is set out in the TRIPS agreement. Please do not confuse generic medicines with counterfeit medicines. Another important point is safeguards. Texts cannot be too rigorous in ensuring a true balance between the rights of users and those of rights holders. I refer you to the various formulations contained in the TRIPS agreement. I welcome your comments about the Internet and I have great confidence in the idea that ACTA will not serve to weaken the EU position clearly expressed in the E-Commerce Directive. Commissioner, there are definitely other issues I should raise this morning, but the first duty I am setting myself is to ensure that, thanks to this debate, we are able to provide as much information as possible on this agreement to all our fellow citizens, and to tell you that the key element for me is the protection of their rights and their fundamental freedoms. This is why I expect you to bear in mind the points raised by Members and to defend them during the negotiations. I also call on you to honour your commitment to publish the text as soon as the negotiations have been completed, whether this is at the end of the round in Japan or at a subsequent stage. The public debate will have to take place, for example, in this Chamber. I shall therefore ask for a resolution, and we expect you to take our point of view into account before any signing of ACTA takes place, even if this means returning to the negotiating table.

 I voted today in favour of this resolution because it strongly condemns Israel’s attack on the humanitarian flotilla bound for Gaza, and demands that an international and impartial inquiry be carried out in order to shed all possible light on this deadly assault. This is a firm stance that demonstrates our common desire to see justice served, and I welcome that. For too long, Europe has been an economic giant, the leading provider of development aid to the region, but a political dwarf, incapable of having a decisive influence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict so as to enable a peaceful solution to be found. Today, thanks to the perseverance of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, this House is expressing its clear, strong position in favour of the immediate lifting of the Gaza blockade, which has resulted in a genuine humanitarian disaster. Europe must face up to its responsibilities. It has a duty to play a decisive political role in order to finally achieve concrete results in view of the creation of a viable Palestinian state.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial, economic and social crisis that we are going through is unprecedented. It is hitting our continent and its peoples hard, it is causing huge social and human difficulties, and Greece, unfortunately, is a harsh and shameful example of this for us. Unemployment is constantly rising. Already, millions of Europeans are jobless, and the figure is rising from one day to the next. The response must be political, strong, swift and coordinated, and it must take into account the serious environmental crisis that we are going through, which requires a new development model. These many crises give rise, among our fellow citizens, to a great deal of expectation and to a hope to which the Europe 2020 strategy should have responded. However, in the face of these challenges on an exceptional scale, the response has not materialised, and I regret that. The guidelines laid down in March by the European Council are not up to the task. There is no determination, no ambition, but, unfortunately, that does not surprise me any more. Everywhere, you Members of the Council and of the Commission, you and your Commissioners boast about the consistency of your policies. However, I have the impression that this is just an umbrella concept to disguise your lack of action. You do not have a consistent strategy combining economic, social, trade, industrial, agricultural or research policies to guarantee sustainable and fair development. Moreover, the external dimension of European trade-related action is nowhere to be found or is under the auspices of the untouchable liberal ‘global Europe’ dogma. We want trade to be a proper instrument that helps to create jobs and growth, to combat poverty and to promote development. However, you are pursuing – not for technical reasons, but for political reasons – a different objective: you are racing to reduce costs and to cut wages, you are racing to conclude bilateral free trade agreements to the detriment of multilateralism, thereby causing social and fiscal dumping. That policy is responsible for too many job losses, too many relocations and too much social damage to carry on as it is. To conclude, we expect the Commission and the Council to rekindle the European spirit, and to reject national self-interest so as to make Europe a haven not just of prosperity, but of solidarity too. Ensuring that Europe projects a different image of itself not only to its own citizens, but also to the rest of the world: that is what the resolution by the Group of the Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is all about.

The resolution on ACTA, which has been adopted today and of which I am one of the initiators, is extremely symbolic because it is unanimous. It is a clear signal sent out to the Commission, which has been negotiating this agreement in the utmost secrecy for two years. Parliament demands complete transparency with regard to the negotiations under way, as well as respect for the treaties, which entitle it to receive the same information as the Council. Whether in terms of the method or in terms of what we know of the substance, I am opposed to the way in which the ACTA negotiations are being conducted. We have many fears with regard to the calling into question of the acquis communautaire
. Aside from the risk of reintroducing the ‘flexible’ response, respect for the fundamental rights of citizens, in terms of freedom of expression and of protection of privacy and of data, and the principle of non­liability of Internet access providers and hosts could be called into question. Parliament has already proved its commitment to these principles, and if the Commission does not change its strategy, I will lead the campaign against the ratification of ACTA by Parliament, as we have already been able to do for the SWIFT Agreement.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is currently experiencing an unprecedented crisis which, beyond the economic and financial crisis, represents first and foremost a crisis of the system. Even before beginning to deal with the effects of the economic crisis on world trade, which forms the topic of our debate, I wish to clarify one point: trade is not a victim of the crisis; it is also one of its contributing factors. Indeed, we are currently experiencing a period of huge global imbalances, fuelled, on the one hand, by certain countries’ excessive trade deficits at the cost of growing domestic indebtedness and, on the other, by trade surpluses stimulated by the exports of certain, especially emerging, countries with internal consumption that is not growing at the same rate. Moreover, the trade liberalisation policy conducted thus far has only exacerbated these imbalances, weakening, in particular, the poorest countries on the planet. These countries, which have been encouraged to specialise in export monocultures, have therefore found themselves destitute in the face of extreme fluctuations in the prices of raw materials, the volatility of which has increased as a result of international speculation. It is a strange world that sets as its first Millennium Development Goal the eradication of poverty and hunger but then, at the same time, speculates on the rise in wheat prices. However, the very people who defended liberalisation and deregulation at any cost in the 1990s are now finding themselves in a difficult situation as well. The continual rise in job losses, stagnant, sometimes even negative, growth, and the developing social crisis are all factors that mean we can no longer afford to let jobs disappear in the name of this cult. In a period of crisis, how do we explain to employees who are losing their jobs that the main thing is to maintain deregulated trade, even at the cost of sudden and sometimes tragic relocations? The crisis we are going through is therefore definitely a systemic crisis, to which we must respond with a new development model. In its current Global Europe strategy, the vision developed by the Commission is essentially based on access to the market and the liberalisation of all sectors. Commissioner, I believe we need to redefine this strategy, which has been on the wrong track and sometimes led to setbacks. It is not by forcing developing countries to open up even more that we will revive our industries’ exports. That would only aggravate the situation in those countries, which already accommodate 70% of the 59 million people in the world who lost their jobs in 2009. On the contrary, it is essential to consider a new strategy that strikes the right balance between openness, protection and support. I would like to return to these ideas. We cannot ignore these developments, which lead the United States to make further use of its trade defence tool or China to take issue with the WTO over European anti-dumping measures. Indeed, when we are faced with unfair practices, it is clear that protection is necessary, but the principle of it must be accepted and defended internationally and the sometimes false accusations of protectionism dismissed once and for all. Moreover, the need for support for trade policies is becoming more obvious every day, and such support depends, in particular, on the policies implemented by the Union being genuinely consistent. Consistency in policies is not an intellectual debate, but an absolute necessity if we want to redefine a new development model. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in September, we were already debating in plenary the free trade agreement between the European Union and Korea. There were already many of us who expressed our fears about the negative consequences of this agreement, especially with regard to the automobile sector. We did not think that events would prove us right so quickly. On 21 January, Opel announced the closure of its Anvers site, the production activities of which will be relocated to South Korea. Are we to believe that this decision has nothing to do with the free trade agreement that has just been negotiated? Allow me to spot a connection there. During this period of economic crisis in which the workers are the first to pay for the mistakes of the financiers, the Commission is duty-bound to consider, now more than ever, the job-related consequences of the agreements that it negotiates. It is no longer possible to give a simplistic response to these employees, for whom we know full well it will be very difficult to find another job. We cannot say to them that international trade is a game of winners and losers and that, unfortunately, they are the ones who will be sacrificed and that we can do nothing about it. We expect answers from you today, Commissioner. First of all, we want to know whether your Directorate-General has assessed the impact of this agreement on jobs in Europe, for I must tell you that the figure greedily announced, that is, the EUR 19 billion profit that European exporters are expected to make, does not convince us. Where does this figure come from? On what study is it based? Leaving aside the expected positive effects, however, have the negative effects also been taken into account? The Commission has drafted a regulation on the methods for implementing safeguard measures within the context of this agreement. These methods relate, in particular, to duty drawback, an advantage that has never before been conceded, not even to our developing trade partners. The proposals put forward provide for complicated procedures for invoking and enforcing the safeguard clauses. Nevertheless I feel reassured because, for the first time ever, Parliament will soon be able to express an opinion on this text under the ordinary legislative procedure. I would, however, like to point out that Europe’s employment problem will not be solved by palliative measures taken on a case-by-case basis. That is why I, together with my whole group, am calling for a real European industrial policy, one that represents a genuine strategy for the future of our industries, to be drawn up at last. In a context of economic crisis and of intensified global competition, this industrial policy must be coordinated effectively with the common trade policy so that our free trade agreements do not lead to job cuts in Europe. A second matter on which we expect clarification is that of the protocol on cultural cooperation included in the agreement. Several Member States have reacted very harshly to the negotiations initiated with Korea, a country that has failed to ratify the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. I condemn the very principle of initiating negotiations on this topic, and I believe that cultural issues should be handled separately from trade negotiations and placed in the hands of the Commissioner for Culture so as to prevent this matter from becoming a negotiating item under the same heading as conventional goods or services. To conclude, Commissioner, you know how essential it is for MEPs to be kept fully informed of the negotiations under way and to be involved at all stages, including from the point at which the negotiating mandate is defined. Leaving aside our differences in approach, I would like to point out that better upstream consultation of Parliament would have made it easier for us to understand the strategy being pursued. I therefore trust I can count on your support and on that of your Commission to assist us in our future work, with everyone acting within the scope of his responsibilities, but always for the benefit of a trade policy that is obviously more European in scope, but that is, above all, fairer.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, trade policy is going to be a major factor in the Union’s external policy. Unfortunately, this trade policy is today the symbol of the disappearance of Community interest, since it is nothing other than the addition of national interests. At a time when we want Europe to defend its values – solidarity, social justice – when we want Europe to be able to integrate into its trade agreements social rights, environmental rights, the protection of human rights and the protection of trade union rights, we realise that the Commission’s only proposal to us is to conclude agreements in which it is felt that there is no alternative to the market and trade and that they are an end in themselves. This, as far as my political family is concerned, is unacceptable. At a time when we want this trade policy to be able to integrate industrial policy and the effects that it may have on employment policies, we realise that the Commission has given no guarantees on these points in the comments made this morning by the President of the Commission. Unfortunately, however, this does not surprise me. Nothing has been said about the horizontal social clause, about the protection of public services, about the way to see Europe change policy again or have a totally different policy. To conclude my remarks on these issues, Mr Barroso, I believe that trust is built within a two-way relationship. With your comments this morning, you have not offered us what we need to put our trust in you. Please note that, since you have not provided these guarantees, I cannot guarantee that we will put our trust in you. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Zapatero, Mr Buzek, ladies and gentlemen, in this period of crisis, trade policy occupies an ever more important place in public debate, as Europeans are increasingly finding that the trade strategy introduced at Union level has a direct impact on growth and employment. Against a background of increased international competition, the race for reduced costs has led to too many job losses or relocations. In the face of this situation, our group considers that trade must be a tool to serve objectives such as job creation, the reduction of inequalities and sustainable development. During his hearing, the Commissioner for Trade, Mr De Gucht, appeared to agree that trade could not be an end in itself. I should therefore like to know if, in the course of your Presidency, you will support a reform of European trade policy to ensure that it creates more jobs and is linked more closely to a true industrial policy. Will you also take action to support fair trade at world level, fair trade that is capable of promoting development, decent work and respect for human rights? In other words, will you introduce binding social and environmental standards into our agreements? Kader Arif,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we have an opportunity today to talk about the anti-homosexual draft legislation submitted to the Ugandan Parliament on 25 September. At a time when we are seeing an increasing number of human rights violations, I feel it is crucial, in the light of this anti-freedom law, for the European Parliament to look beyond the divisions that separate its political families and be able to condemn this bill in the strongest possible terms and to call on the Ugandan Parliament to reject the bill and to review its national legislation in order to decriminalise homosexuality. As Mr Cashman pointed out just now, every single NGO has spoken out against this bill, regarding it, moreover, as a serious obstacle to the fight against AIDS. The Commission, through Commissioner De Gucht, and a large majority of the Member States – adding their voice to the statements made by President Obama – have already condemned this initiative. I therefore call on the Commission to rethink our involvement with Uganda if this bill is adopted. A country that, at that point, would be in violation not only of international law but also of the fundamental principles of the Cotonou agreements could not continue to benefit from the support of the European Union. To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to point out that everyone must have the right to freedom of sexual orientation, without fear of imprisonment or death. This principle is not open to debate.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Doha Round was clear. It was supposed to be a round to promote development, a round allowing developing countries to correct the imbalances created by the liberal policies implemented to date within the framework of the notorious Washington Consensus. It is not surprising – although I deplore the fact – that during this crisis period, positions favouring equitable trade are on the retreat. In the face of the United States, which will not move until the health reform has been passed, and in the context of growing opposition from trade unions and the main industrial lobby groups, Europe is not managing to shift the boundaries, and it is therefore unlikely that an agreement will be reached soon. The majority within this Parliament is therefore taking advantage of the fact to return to its ideology, that of aggressive trade, based solely on the interests of gaining greater market access. Blame the crisis. In acting in this way, in seeking, above all, the opening up of the markets and the removal of all barriers to trade, those on the right wing are, in addition, completely forgetting that it is in our interests to have strong trade partners that are fully integrated into the system of world trade. The reality is that no developing country could end up strengthened by such an agreement. Together with Mr Désir, our group’s rapporteur on this resolution, we have tabled several amendments to the joint compromise text produced by the right-wing European political parties. Of course, I would like to see my own group’s resolution adopted, but this will not happen. That is why our amendments make several points. Firstly, it is absolutely vital that public services remain outside the framework of the negotiations, because they relate to people’s fundamental needs and cannot be left to the markets. Next, special treatment should be given to products which are sensitive for developing countries, particularly in the agricultural sphere. The food crisis has been swept out of people’s minds by the arrival of the financial and economic crisis. Let us not forget that food sovereignty should be our absolute priority, the first of the Millennium Development Goals. Finally, we believe that the public intervention area in developing countries should be maintained, not only by ruling out any liberalisation of public contracts, but also by protecting new industries. These few points, which are not an exhaustive list, are the absolute minimum in order to ensure that the Doha Round will truly promote development. If they do not appear in the final text, I will call upon my group to vote against it. (Applause) Kader Arif,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Moreira for his speech. On 9 December, the Euro-Mediterranean trade ministers will meet to debate the revival of our economic and trade cooperation. Firstly, I would like us all to be clear about something: if the aim of the free trade area was indeed to benefit all of the partners, from the North and from the South, setting 2010 as the date on which it will be introduced was neither realistic nor even desirable, given that there are still huge disparities in development terms between the north and the south sides of the Mediterranean. Moreover, some people are still advocating the fact that, to make progress with the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership – which I would remind you is made up of three pillars: politics, economics, and society and culture – we simply need to brush aside the political difficulties in order to make headway with the economic and trade aspect. As you will have gathered, I do not believe in this magical and pernicious view that trade alone can help us progress towards harmonious integration, peace and stability. I believe in it even less since the facts speak for themselves. For example, the Union for the Mediterranean, in brushing aside the political conflicts, was supposed to revive stagnant Euro-Mediterranean cooperation with so-called concrete and visible projects. Today, it is the Union for the Mediterranean that is stagnating, and the political disputes that have gone unmentioned have come back to haunt it. I am among those who are fiercely attached to the spirit of the Barcelona Process, who believe that progress is not measured solely by trade statistics, which are, incidentally, still too unfavourable to our partners from the South, to their populations. Trade for trade’s sake – no, I definitely do not believe in it. On the other hand, trade that is focused on development and aimed at reducing the gap between rich and poor, at ensuring that prosperity really is shared and that regional integration exists – yes, I can conceive of that. However, the negotiations still need to be steered in this direction. That is why, at this next meeting, I ask that we all be ambitious, that we not just discuss technical matters to do with the removal of barriers to trade, as though that were the aim. It is unacceptable to go on thinking that way. Regional integration, particularly in terms of the South-South network, the solutions to be adopted for the economic crisis – which is having a severe impact with its associated job losses – human, social and environmental considerations, and the human rights issue must sustain the discussions and become our main concerns once again. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

Mr President, I had not anticipated having to respond to Mrs Dodds but I would just like to tell her that she should read the Treaty of Lisbon because, if there is one committee that will be strengthened by the Treaty of Lisbon, it is the Committee on International Trade. Therefore I can say that, when that time comes, the European Parliament will have slightly more influence in the months or years ahead. Mr Moreira put some very precise questions to the commissioner. I heard Mr Tajani answer: Libya and Syria. There was one issue that was, all the same, disposed of very quickly, and that was the whole human rights issue, on which there has been no precise response. I very much want there to be progress in the negotiations with Libya and Syria but, at the same time, precise answers must be given to the EU’s questions, enquiries and requests regarding human rights. My second point is that I feel it is impossible to talk about the Euro-Mediterranean area without raising the Israel-Palestine issue, when we see products being imported today from the occupied territories. I would therefore also like to know where the Commission stands on this issue. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not our first debate on origin marking but, as I am sure that repetition has its benefits, I will take the liberty of joining my fellow Members in stressing the need for European legislation on ‘made in’ origin marking. Indeed, in spite of the opinion expressed by this House in 2005, then in 2007, via the vote on the resolution by our colleague, Mr Barón Crespo, the lack of a majority within the Council has always prevented the adoption of this regulation. However, a text such as this would represent a crucial advance, not only for European consumers, but also for our industries. Indeed, by indicating the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries, consumers would be fully informed of the characteristics of the product they are buying. In such sensitive sectors as clothing, leather goods and furniture, creating the conditions for consumers to make an informed choice is a major issue for those companies that have taken the decision to maintain production in Europe, preserving European knowledge and European jobs. I therefore welcome the proposal that you have just made, Commissioner, but I am anxious to stress that this proposal must remain ambitious. Seeking the support of a majority of Member States must not be done at the expense of our ultimate goal. For example, it would be unacceptable for origin marking to concern only finished products, thus making it possible to import all the components separately, to assemble them in Europe and to describe them as being ‘made in Europe’. Moreover, I would like to support the Commission’s efforts to derive maximum benefit from such an agreement. Therefore, without coming back to a repeated request to improve and to simply the rules of origin, the possibility of creating a pan-Euro-Mediterranean mark would be a significant advance in terms of strengthening sectors built around the Mediterranean and South-South trade. Lastly, I should like to stress that, as part of the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Committee on International Trade will see its powers substantially increased. The Commission will therefore be able to count – I assure you, Commissioner – on the full commitment of MEPs to monitor closely the discussions on this crucial regulation for European consumers and workers. Kader Arif  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis that we are going through is profound and long lasting. It is therefore urgent and absolutely essential to put in place the necessary regulations and supervision of the financial sector and the banks, to prevent an even more drastic repeat of today’s crisis. The financial system must once again serve the real economy and not continue to destroy it. From this point of view, the last G20 Summit in London, which has been mentioned, ended in what were, to say the least, partial proposals, but, above all, the words have not been turned into deeds, and the financial drift is there once again. In view of this situation, and so that the Pittsburgh G20 Summit really is useful, the European Union must defend strong regulatory measures that have real consequences. Beyond the essential measures to supervise finance listed by a number of my fellow Members, I personally would like to raise the issues of trade and development, because in Pittsburgh there will also be talk of relaunching the Doha Round. Relaunch it, yes, but with the condition that the initial and central objective of this Round, that is to say development, is not sidelined again. Our southern partners, quite rightly, will not accept that their concerns continue to remain unanswered. The issue at stake in this G20 goes beyond that of the financial crisis: it is about laying the foundations of new global governance. Kader Arif,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to hear a conservative and a liberal fellow Member agree with the Commission; it makes my job as a socialist easier. I hope, in any case, that this evening’s debate will make it possible at last to address the many concerns regarding the impact of this free trade agreement between the European Union and Korea and, in particular, on European industry. You spoke of a consensus but, Commissioner, I would remind you that, for some months now, certain industrial sectors – including car manufacturers and workers’ unions, which support them – have been warning you of the possible tragic consequences of this agreement. Today, the bulk of these issues have still not been addressed. It may be the case, however, that you have chosen to sacrifice the European car industry for the benefit of services. Indeed, why allow Korea to have duty drawback, which is a benefit that has never been granted before, not even to developing countries such as the countries of the Mediterranean? What is the logic behind flexible rules of origin, the impact of which is to be feared, not only for the car industry, but also for the European textile industry? Why allow such distortions of competition and, above all, why set this precedent? In the face of these risks, and, unfortunately, of others, which I cannot expand on here but the details of which you know – you have just mentioned them – the Commission has proposed a last resort, the inclusion of a safeguard clause. However, you know, Commissioner, that the safeguard clause is not automatic and that it will be very difficult to implement and impossible to activate for five years. I will cite just one example to illustrate our fears. If the free trade agreement allows Korea to export 100 000 additional vehicles to Europe – it already exports 600 000 of them annually – 6 000 jobs will be lost. Conversely, Europe is terribly restricted, with each manufacturer being able to export just 1 000 vehicles to Korea, as part of a total European quota of 6 000 vehicles. At this time of crisis, which is having a particular effect on car workers, how do you explain Europe’s committing itself to such an agreement? Do you envisage a renegotiation of the controversial points that I have just mentioned? This is what a number of Member States and industrial sectors that I have just mentioned are calling for, anyway. Will you commit yourself at last, Commissioner, to ensuring greater transparency and to involving us MEPs to a greater extent? We, and the Commission, created the conditions for a negative image of the Polish plumber; let us not create a negative image of the Korean coach builder. Kader Arif (S&amp;D).

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by joining with the previous speakers in condemning in the harshest possible terms the coup d’état 
staged against the government of President Zelaya in Honduras. His arbitrary detention and his expulsion from the country are in breach of the constitutional order, which must be restored as quickly as possible. The military overthrow that led to Roberto Micheletti proclaiming himself as the new president brings to mind the darkest periods in the history of Central America that we have known, and this attack on democracy is unacceptable in our view. I therefore welcome the Organization of American States’ decision to suspend Honduras’ involvement in the organisation, and the acceptance of President Oscar Arias as a mediator helping to find a solution. However, I am also very concerned, Commissioner, about the commercial relations that the European Union maintains with this country. For several months negotiations have been taking place between the European Commission and Central America on a new-generation association agreement. Following the coup d’état
, meetings planned last week have been cancelled. We should be glad about that. I thought I understood you, but I should like to have more details. Is the Commission determined to suspend the negotiations until the institutional political situation in Honduras has returned to normal? That is what I and my political group are asking, but I should like to have more details concerning the Commission’s position on this point. Another issue that I wish to raise, Commissioner, is that of the Generalised System of Preferences Plus, from which Honduras benefits. Several organisations from civil society have reported arbitrary decisions and human rights violations since the coup d’état
, particularly as regards freedom of movement, association and expression. The European Commission has to be very firm on this issue. The GSP+ is an incentive, the benefits of which are dependent on clear commitments. The testimonies are more than enough to cast doubt on whether the State of Honduras is fulfilling its commitments under its self-proclaimed president. I therefore call on the Commission to launch an investigation into the possibility of temporarily withholding the preferences granted to Honduras under the GSP+. Karim Zéribi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is proposing that we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the single market and forge further ahead with its completion. In the field of transport, two areas are identified in Single Market Act II: rail and maritime transport. I am surprised not to see cabotage services provided by road, scheduled for 2013, mentioned here. This will have a massive impact on the environment and lead to more social dumping than is the case at present. I would like to think this was an oversight, though one might consider it a deliberate error. Commissioner, you can be very pleased with the achievements of the last 20 years, but you cannot hide the reality of the social landscape or the crisis affecting Europe on the job front. As far as the forthcoming reforms in both the maritime and the rail sectors are concerned, these are based on a one-size-fits-all approach, that of liberalisation. Commissioner, this headlong rush has to stop. The single market is not dogma. It is a tool that should serve economic development, environmental transition and the social wellbeing of our fellow citizens. We cannot reasonably take any more without introducing social and fiscal harmonisation measures that are effective with any future directive. There has to be a level playing field for everyone. My group will, in particular, be making sure that we avoid the abuses of the past and, for every area where the market is being liberalised, will demand that a social and environmental package be introduced so that competition is fair and brings development and prosperity for our continent. Karim Zéribi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to draw your attention to the issue of the Roma minority, which is very topical in France and in Europe. The European Union has, to its credit, invested heavily in its programmes to integrate the Roma populations. More than EUR 17 billion will be allocated over the period 2007-2013 via the European Social Fund (ESF), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and, to a lesser extent, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). However, there are numerous indications that these funds have been under-utilised. In Marseille, the city in which I was elected, 1 500 Roma live in inhumane and revolting conditions, which creates tensions. Expelling the Roma does not resolve their situation at all and does not address the real issue, which is their integration. We must act. Commissioner, you say that the integration of the Roma, who are Europeans, is as much the responsibility of the host country as it is of the country of origin. You are right. However, we must therefore strengthen control over the use of EU subsidies and ensure that the Commission reassesses, if necessary, the national strategies adopted. Furthermore, we should entrust the management of Structural Funds granted today to locally elected bodies, which will have an interest in solving the problem because they are closer to the citizen. Parliament will then have to ensure that the use of these funds is assessed regularly. Liem Hoang Ngoc,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the euro area is again entering recession. The exit strategy advocated by the Council and the Commission until last June has plunged us into crisis. Euroscepticism is gaining ground. In this context, the Van Rompuy report, which must define the next stage of economic and monetary union, has particular significance. Sadly, the Council has refused to involve Parliament fully in drafting this roadmap. Ms Thyssen’s report is therefore the opportunity for Parliament to invite itself to the debate in order to send a strong message. I salute the remarkable work done by Ms Thyssen, who has demonstrated the sort of constructive attitude that shows our fellow citizens that Parliamentary debate has a point. The point of this debate is to take stock of the levers so desperately lacking for the functioning of economic and monetary union. Firstly, an integrated banking union is needed to control the banks, guarantee deposits and resolve crises without taxpayers again having to foot the bill. Secondly, a budgetary union is needed, within which the serious budgetary approach of Member States is matched by support for sustainable development on a European scale. This union must be given a budgetary capacity fuelled by new own resources, allocation of which must be debated within the framework of the Union method, this being the only way to guarantee solidarity among the 27 Member States. Thirdly, a genuine democratic leap is needed, without which transfers of sovereignty will continue to be seen by our fellow citizens as so many powers commandeered by bureaucrats. Parliament, as the main agent of representative democracy, must therefore play a part at each stage of the European Semester. Parliament must be involved in the functioning of the European stability mechanism. Parliament must be able to monitor the troika, particularly when the International Monetary Fund itself declares that the troika has made a serious error. Last but not least, a social – fifth – pillar is needed to guarantee wage standards, preventing structural reforms from causing a recessionary spiral. A social pillar to prevent budgetary discipline from reducing the quality of public services and social protection. A social pillar to encourage integration of young people into the labour market and access to housing for all. A social pillar to reassure our fellow citizens, for whom Europe is synonymous with saving the banks on the one hand, but worsening most people’s circumstances on the other. That is the strong mandate that Parliament must give its President on the eve of the November and December Council meetings. The Council will hear this message even more clearly if tomorrow it receives – thanks to you, ladies and gentlemen– the largest possible majority. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, the October Council decided on a timetable for the implementation of June’s decisions. The banking union will therefore see the light of day in 2014. It will allow us to supervise 6 000 banks in the euro area. It will guarantee deposits and be responsible for resolving banking crises. This will prevent the taxpayers from having to pay the price once again, because the citizens, and workers in particular, are not the culprits responsible for the crisis; the real criminals are the greedy financiers. They have taken the role of police, accusing the citizens of always wanting too many social elements. However, the social pillar is exactly what is missing from your interim road map, Mr Van Rompuy; that and the democratic pillar. As a result, many of our citizens are becoming more Eurosceptic today. The members of the EP’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs affirmed in the Thyssen report that there cannot be genuine economic and monetary union without democracy and without a social pact. The European Parliament must have its say at each stage of the European Semester. It must be able to discuss the troika’s decisions. It must be involved in the European Stability Mechanism governance structure. Finally, budgetary discipline must, in each Member State, be accompanied by a substantial European budgetary capacity in order to deal with asymmetric shocks, as you say yourself, Mr Van Rompuy. However, this counter-cyclical fund must be financed using new, sustainable resources, and it must be managed under the Community method in order to prevent the collapse of the Union. Ladies and gentlemen, many of us agree that there cannot be a successful federal transition without solidarity, without social progress and without democratic progress. That is the message that our Parliament and its President must spread in the ongoing debate. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, the ‘two-pack’ applies to France, as it does to most countries in the euro area. France, however, has just issued its latest government bonds at historically low rates. It has to get its economy growing again so as to reduce its deficits and continue to benefit from such rates. To that end, Ms Ferreira raises the possibility of proactive investment policies by proposing, like Mario Monti, to change the way deficits are calculated so as to distinguish the role of public investment. She also supports the creation of eurobonds, which are needed to curb speculation. Since the future of the euro is at stake, the conservatives would be taking on a serious responsibility if they rejected the amendments and compromises, including these two proposals. As for the Gauzès report, by generalising the reversed qualified majority principle, it places all the power in the hands of the Commission, whose recommendations are particularly controversial not only in Greece but also in France and elsewhere. The democratic debate should not be closed. Parliament should have the right to veto the Commission’s decisions. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 – (FR)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has moved on to practical work and we have tried to improve its draft text in committee. We now have a basis of assessment including exchange transactions, derivatives, equities and bonds traded on the secondary market. Like the Commissioner, we want the financial transaction tax to be imposed on pension funds and undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), which, unfortunately, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wants to exclude. We also have two tax rates, including a lower rate for derivatives, which seems paradoxical given that we want to combat speculation. By and large, however, the compromise we are reaching will be an important step forward, especially if it obtains a large majority in plenary. This would send a strong signal to the Council, where political change in France is opening up new possibilities for European growth initiatives, funding for which could be achieved through the mobilisation of this first European tax instrument. This places the burden fairly and squarely on the financial sector, which is responsible for the crisis, and not on its victims, European citizens. The tax revenue will also help reduce the contribution of the Member States, which are being asked to reduce their deficit. In this way, Parliament is suggesting that it is not impossible to reconcile fiscal justice, deficit reduction and support for growth. This is a good omen, ladies and gentlemen, ahead of the informal European Council summit on growth, which is opening this evening. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

Blue-card question

 Mr President, Mr Audy, would you include tax cuts in the public finances audit that you are proposing? Liem Hoang Ngoc,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. 
– (FR)
 Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur for the political will she has displayed in this report. We all know that some Member States manipulate their corporate tax base more or less secretly to reduce their real level of taxation and practise tax dumping. That is why we, as socialists and federalists, have always supported the idea of moving towards tax harmonisation in the European Union. Unfortunately, by proposing a consolidated base that was merely optional, the European Commission did not seek to take a first step towards harmonising corporate tax, but simply to create a tax optimisation instrument. This was not acceptable to our political grouping, since the Europe we believe in is not a self-service Europe serving only corporate interests.
 It is, above all, a political and social Europe built for all, involving everyone. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I have fought for months to change the logic of the Commission’s text radically, namely, to move from a voluntary to a compulsory system and introduce a minimum level of taxation. Negotiations were not easy but we succeeded in reaching agreement because, beyond our political differences – which are significant – all of us around the table shared an ambitious vision of Europe. Despite her initial reluctance, the rapporteur ultimately accepted the principle of a compulsory common consolidated corporate tax base for all large companies in the EU. Unfortunately, we did not manage to establish a minimum rate but the report clearly identifies the problems posed by too large a spread in rates and calls for the issue of rates to be re-examined when reviewing the application of this text. We will monitor this closely, because for us, it is an indispensable second phase. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I call on you to give overwhelming support to Ms Thyssen’s report. In doing so, we will send a strong message to the Council and, above all, to citizens, who are the first to suffer from the evils of tax competition. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

Blue-card question.

Mr President, Mr Gauzès, you speak of the sovereignty of the people, but you have also spoken of the ‘two-pack’ for which you are the rapporteur. You want to transpose – and I am talking to you about a European text – you want to transpose a treaty into secondary European legislation. You want to transpose the treaty of austerity together with its symbol, the leaden rule. It is a leaden rule that will plunge Europe into recession, as my fellow Member, Mr Canfin, said. You want to transpose this leaden rule into secondary legislation even before the peoples of Europe have been able to take a decision and ratify the treaty. Mr Gauzès, my question is a simple one: you speak of the sovereignty of the people, so are you going to withdraw your Amendment 9 from this ‘two-pack’, which shows true contempt for democracy?

) The intergovernmental treaty that the European governments are about to sign is unacceptable for two reasons. It is unacceptable in terms of the procedure adopted, which is anti-democratic and rides roughshod over half a century of the Community method. It is also unacceptable in terms of content, in that it is aimed at tightening the already suffocating straitjacket of the Stability Pact and imposing unprecedented austerity policies throughout Europe. These policies can do nothing but plunge us into a lasting recession, destroy our social model and make the poorest citizens pay the price for a crisis of which they are the first victims. They will not resolve the debt problem as austerity will kill consumption and investment and, with them, any hope of growth or the recovery of public finances. The fact the ECB has just granted the banks a loan of EUR 489 billion for three years at 1% interest, while Greece has a knife put to its throat, is proof that Europe has currently got things completely the wrong way round. Curiously, these banks are not suspected of ‘moral hazard’, in contrast to the Member States, which the ECB is not allowed to finance directly. They will therefore be able to buy back sovereign bonds at 6 or even 10% and continue their speculative activities with this free money. This is not the Europe we want. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 The new Treaty that the German right intends to push through would deprive the Member States of a budgetary policy by forcing them to implement austerity policies that are set to plunge Europe into recession without reducing deficits. Economic policy choices would be enshrined in the constitutions and placed under the authority of a Court of Justice. Automatic penalties would be applied to countries whose public deficit exceeds 3% of their GDP. However, this Treaty fails to include any measures for resolving the economic and social crisis: there is nothing about Eurobonds or about the ECB intervening on the primary market to purchase government bonds. Therefore, how can anyone be surprised about the rise in euroscepticism? We urgently need to show that a progressive economic strategy is possible. We call for the creation of a European treasury, the embryo of which could be the European Financial Stability Facility, and for an independent rating agency, attached to the European Court of Auditors. The power to rate sovereign debts would be taken away from private agencies, in which there are obvious conflicts of interest. We also propose the creation of an investment pact to revive the economy through the exclusion of investment expenditure from the calculation of public deficits. With an EU budget swelled by Eurobonds and the financial transaction tax, we would fund the upwards convergence of competitiveness levels and social and fiscal rules. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Draghi, ladies and gentlemen, this annual report has finally broken certain taboos. It calls on the Commission to create a European credit rating foundation and to consider temporarily suspending credit ratings for countries that require support from the Union. The report recognises the merit of the European Central Bank (ECB) repurchasing bonds on the secondary market, which has allowed banks to maintain their balance sheets and continue to borrow on the interbank market. This action prevented a liquidity crisis. Yet in order to resolve the sovereign debt crisis, the ECB needs to be authorised to intervene on the primary market when it becomes illiquid. Even Germany is struggling to obtain funds. Italian bonds are being issued at ever-higher rates. If there is no intervention, the risk of Italy defaulting will seriously compromise the health of the banks. The banks will approve fewer loans and will not be able to meet the new solvency ratio requirements. Parliament’s report also stresses the need for a European Treasury able to issue federal bonds at lower rates, as is the case in the United States. In the event of speculator activity, the ECB should be authorised to repurchase these eurobonds, like its counterparts in the US and the United Kingdom. Did you know that these two countries are generating funds at historically low rates, despite a rating downgrade for one of them? Ladies and gentlemen, we are not in the same situation as Germany in the 1920s – nowadays, production capacities are underused. Therefore, demand is not driving inflation. There is no cost inflation because we have wage moderation, or because the gloomy economy is keeping commodities costs low despite speculatory activity. We need to acknowledge that the time has come for bold monetary policies, given the current failure to recognise that budgetary orthodoxy is absurd in times of recession. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 The agreement of 27 October is flabbergasting. The austerity policies that it intends to include in the constitutions will plunge Europe into a recession where tax revenues will dry up and deficits will widen. They will increase the risks associated with holding sovereign debts, leading to higher interest rates. The banks will see their balance sheets deteriorate and will struggle to increase their capital. Only the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) would allow for a restructuring of debts and recapitalisations and defuse any new tension about rates. To do so, it would have to turn into the embryonic European Treasury, issuing Eurobonds which the European Central Bank (ECB) could buy back at a lower rate. There are no plans for this. The fund, which started off with EUR 440 billion, now only has EUR 250 billion. To raise the EUR 1 trillion supposed to reassure the markets, it will transform the sovereign debts held into derivatives to activate the ‘leverage effect’. However, the recession will increase the risk of defaults. We hardly dare imagine the effects of this securitisation of Italian and Spanish debts should these countries partly default. This agreement is explosive for the financial system, already under threat from austerity measures which are crippling growth. Turning to China rather than the ECB is detrimental to industry and employment in Europe. Liem Hoang Ngoc,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there will be no political Europe without a fiscal Europe. Unfortunately, the two issues that we are debating today demonstrate the Commission’s lack of ambition on that subject. As regards the system of taxation for parent companies with subsidiaries in other Member States, under the current directive, these groups are undertaxed, which is detrimental to public finances in the Member States. It has been a boon for transnational groups. In order to remedy this, I proposed in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that a parent company should only be exempt from paying tax on profits generated by subsidiaries on two conditions. Firstly, the parent company must hold the statutory minimum of 15% of company equity in another Member State for an uninterrupted period of at least two years in order to benefit from this tax regime. Sadly, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not accept that minimum period. Secondly, the profits distributed by a subsidiary to the parent company used to be taxed at a rate of 75% or more of the average tax rate in the EU Member States. I am pleased to say that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did agree to maintain the threshold of 70% of the average tax rate. The European Commission chose not to comment during our discussions, which was a pity. Consequently, Commissioner, we are left hoping that you will act on the message that we are sending, since Parliament is still not a colegislator on tax matters. The second symptom of your lack of concern about taxation is your failure to act when the Council quashed the directive on taxation of savings income. The ensuing vacuum has resulted in pick-and-mix bilateral agreements on the exchange of banking information, such as those concluded by the United Kingdom and Germany with Switzerland. Yet the Savings Tax Directive paved the way for automatic exchanges of information with several different tax havens, including Switzerland. The directive was the subject of a report that was adopted by a resounding majority in plenary. Although Mr Barnier has explained that there is no more money available to promote growth, applying the directive would allow us to generate EUR 200 billion for the public purse. A fiscal tool is essential if we are to recover from the crisis. Harmonised taxation is vital for an effective single market. Combating fraud and tax avoidance is crucial if we are to rebalance public accounts. For all these reasons, Commissioner, I can only urge you to do all you can to promote a fiscal Europe, in order to put an end to the Member States’ self-destructive rivalry. The main casualties of that rivalry are growth, public finances and solidarity among European citizens. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our fellow citizens are questioning the merits of austerity policies that are reducing their public services and squeezing their social security. Wherever these policies are rife, they are not succeeding in reducing public debt and bringing down unemployment. The contents of this ‘governance’ package – and I call them ‘contents’ deliberately – that we are discussing today are so ridiculous that even the economists are stunned, because they will prevent budgetary policy from adjusting to economic cycles. During the trialogue, the Commission representatives admitted to us themselves that they have not used any theoretical or econometric model as a basis for making sound predictions and recommendations. They admit that they are working on a purely intuitive basis. In the light of this, it is difficult to understand why the conservative, liberal and eurosceptic Members of this House have blindly attempted to toughen up the text proposed by the Commission. They are even less in a position to preach to us, considering that the governments led by friends of theirs have created these deficits through tax reductions that are as unfair as they are ineffective: is that not right, Mr Gauzès? They make grand statements about the Europe 2020 strategy, but they refuse to allow spending to prepare for the future, such as spending on investment, to be excluded from the calculation of the deficits. Yes, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, that is the crux of the debate as far as we are concerned! Let us reduce the deficits, yes, for example by going back on the tax gifts that have benefited the State’s creditors above all, but let us do it without sacrificing investment, training and jobs, because today’s investments are tomorrow’s jobs and the tax income that will follow, and this will allow us to reduce our deficits. This is the theorem that should appear on the frontispiece of the ‘governance’ package. My fellow conservative and liberal Members, some of you want to punish automatically States that are heretics to your dogma to the tune of billions of euros. They also want to punish countries that will not lower wages in order to regain their external balance. They believe that the deficits are primarily the product of bad intentions on the part of those States, as though the neoliberal model that you never question had not just been through its worst crisis since 1929, and as if it were not already leading to pressure on the buying power of ordinary people and causing a massive contraction in tax income: two problems that were at the root of the rise in private and public indebtedness in the first place. When it comes to the votes, socialists and democrats will send out a clear signal against this austerity package, which can only heighten the indignation that is rising throughout Europe. This clear signal is aimed at all workers in Europe and especially at our fellow citizens in France and Germany as they approach elections that will have a decisive impact on Europe’s future.

 Given the importance of this issue and the strict time constraints to which Parliament has had to work, we can all be pleased with what we have accomplished. In general, I agree with the priorities identified by the various reports, particularly the recognition of professional qualifications, the portability of pension rights, the rationalisation of procurement procedures, initiatives for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and access for all to certain basic banking services Certainly, in my opinion, other measures deserved to be highlighted, such as the issue of collective resources, but I am well aware that it was difficult to decide between these 50 proposals. I am also pleased that we were able to reach a compromise on the social clause, which states that any legislation on the Single Market should be subject to a social impact assessment and, if justified by the findings, should contain a reference to political and social rights. Finally, another reason for us to be satisfied is the fact that Parliament calls for guaranteed access, quality and affordability of services of general economic interest (SGEIs) and social services of general interest (SSGIs), and invites the Commission to take sectoral legislative initiatives in this area.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, 24 March, will be a symbolic day. In the first instance, it will be marked by the amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon that we have just voted for, which will allow a permanent European Stability Mechanism to be established. This mechanism allows the European Union to devise the first Eurobonds, which are designed to finance sovereign debt at low interest rates in the event of speculative attacks. In this respect, it is a shame that the process stopped halfway. To deal with the markets’ irrational exuberance, the revision of the Treaty ought to have been an opportunity to authorise the European Central Bank to do what the United States does and buy back public debt in the event of exchange rate tensions. The process is even more incomplete since the pay-off required is to implement the Competitiveness Pact, re-christened the Pact for the euro. This is the second symbol of tomorrow. This pact is backed unanimously by the Council, the Commission and the European Central Bank. Ladies and gentlemen, you all know the Washington Consensus: you loved it. Well, 24 March sees the birth of the ‘Brussels consensus’. The ‘Brussels consensus’ is the blind, roughshod application of neoliberal dogma: squeezing public services and the welfare state; wage austerity and minimal regulation of the financial markets. Ladies and gentlemen, the Council, the Commission and the ECB have short memories. They are proposing to transpose the Pact for the euro into the governance package so as to enshrine in our system the very policies that led to the economic crisis. In Spain, the UK, Ireland and elsewhere, the rise of household debt, which is fed by the finance industry, has been caused by none other than the crisis in buying power resulting from the pay restraint that has held sway for 20 years. The Pact for the euro unfortunately proposes to make wage austerity a permanent fixture. As for public debt, as well as being a consequence of the economic crisis, it is also a result of pointless tax reductions everywhere, advocated by liberals and conservatives. There was no explosion of public expenditure in Europe: quite the contrary. Budget and wage austerity, combined with the interest rate rises already planned by the European Central Bank, will end up killing off internal demand in Europe and killing off the recovery without reducing deficits. Tomorrow, we will be side by side with employees demonstrating against this ‘Brussels consensus’: this is the third symbol of 24 March. If we do not want to see a return of the likes of the brown shirts, whom Europe was created to stand against, the people’s elected representatives must stand with the people to denounce policies that are as unjust as they are ineffective.

 I am anxious to thank Mr Schwab and the shadow rapporteurs for their work. The Commission’s initial proposal was unacceptable because it intended to harmonise fully the rules concerning consumer rights, without systematically bringing them into line with the most favourable national legislation. In other words, many Member States would have had to remove from their national legislation provisions that in fact granted better protection to consumers. In France, two major acquis
 would have to be abandoned as a result: the ‘latent defect’ rule and the ruling that a doorstep seller is prohibited from collecting payment before the end of the cooling-off period. However my socialist colleagues and I succeeded in getting this approach altered and in making minimum harmonisation the norm. We also managed to enhance consumer rights on a whole range of points, in particular concerning information that has to be provided by the seller and provisions pertaining to the cooling-off period. One problem remains however: chapter V. We cannot accept that the rules on unfair terms be fully harmonised, because that would deprive Member States of their ability to react when faced with commercial practices that change daily and sometimes involve serious risks for consumers.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are debating today offers genuine advances. I am thinking, in particular, of Eurobonds, which the Union will need in order to finance the Europe 2020 strategy. Unfortunately, the right rejected in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs the principle of a tax on financial transactions at European level, despite having voted in favour of it in June. Its arguments for rejecting a European tax on financial transactions as a prelude to a global tax are the same as those put forward by the supporters of tax havens. It tells us that implementing a tax at European level alone would be disastrous for our financial sector. It also says that there would be a flight of capital from Europe. My answer to that is: so what if there is? The current volume of financial transactions is excessive compared to the needs of the real economy. Implementing this tax solely in Europe would help deflate the bubble. Furthermore, if the volume of speculative capital transactions, such as the credit derivatives at the origin of the crisis, were somewhat reduced, it would really help to consolidate the balance sheets of our banks. They would have a much greater incentive to finance the real economy. I would point out to those who are using the absence of an impact assessment for cover that no impact assessment was performed before the green light was given for a proliferation of derivatives. It is time, ladies and gentlemen, for all MEPs to face up to their responsibilities. The European Union must not continue to tag along behind a G20 dominated by the United States and China. It must lead the way in reforming our financial system. That is why I cannot support a text which chooses to overlook a tax on financial transactions. Liem Hoang Ngoc  (S&amp;D

 I would like to thank Mrs Weiler for this high quality report and the outcome of the negotiations with the Council, as the first reading agreement includes all the key elements that were put forward by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and which were approved in the vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. I am especially pleased to see that private companies and public authorities are now placed on an equal footing. The Commission’s initial proposal contained far more stringent penalties for public authorities, a position which our group felt was unacceptable as, unlike private undertakings, public sector bodies are not focused primarily on profit but rather operate in the general interest. The fact that the lender is entitled to compensation for recovery expenses also represents real progress since, up to now, many companies, particularly SMEs, have chosen not to reclaim late-payment interest from borrowers for the simple reason that the cost of the relevant procedures outweighed any financial gains. Finally, the maximum payment period of 30 days set out in the text seems reasonable, given that there is some scope for flexibility, notably for public healthcare bodies, a point that our group deemed particularly important.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, the ECOFIN Council approved the principle of the European Semester. As a federalist, I can only welcome such progress. However, coordinating budgetary policy is one thing; defining their content is another. That is why strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact is a serious mistake. The austerity treatment dogmatically imposed on the whole of Europe is already making its initial effects felt. Spain and Ireland are experiencing ever more difficulties, and the Markit survey, published at the end of August, shows that this treatment is responsible for the stagnation in European growth and, before long, the stagnation in German growth. The series of repressive measures outlined on the agenda of the next informal ECOFIN meeting is even more serious. Imposing automatic financial sanctions on States that are already facing budget problems is irresponsible. It will inevitably fuel the criticisms in all the Member States with regard to their national contributions to the EU budget. Two and a half million citizens expressed the first opposition to the austerity package on the streets of France yesterday. Instead of preserving social safety nets and establishing the social harmony in the EU that is necessary for the recovery, the Council and the Commission are destroying them. Do they measure the impact of such decisions only by the increasing level of Euroscepticism among citizens? For the sake of European integration and of the citizens for whom it is being undertaken, it must be acknowledged, ladies and gentlemen, that strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact is an economic aberration. It is also a serious political mistake. Liem Hoang Ngoc,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the own-initiative report on which we are voting this week is of particular symbolic importance at a time when the markets are unable to assess the risks associated with the economic situation in the euro area. Having demanded severe budget adjustment policies, they now doubt the capacity of Member Sates to kick-start their growth and, hence, to obtain the tax revenue necessary to pay the interest on their debt. Unfortunately, no risk assessment can be carried out in the deeply uncertain context in which the global economy now finds itself. Such an assessment is all the more important in the European Union, where the production capacity utilisation rate is at an all-time low. Instead of investing, companies are mothballing machines because, despite the initial signs of recovery at the end of 2009, demand is lacking. Growth would even end up going into reverse if restrictive measures were to nip the recovery in the bud. The first aim of our report was precisely to determine the optimum time for launching policies for emerging from the crisis. We proposed maintaining the support measures until the normal production capacity utilisation rate was restored. We therefore suggested ratifying the principle of anti-cyclical budgetary policies, which were successfully established during the first phase of the crisis in 2008 and 2009, and which are in line with the spirit of the reform of the 2005 Stability Pact. These policies entail using automatic stabilisers, in other words, in earmarking surpluses from the primary budget for debt repayment at the top of the cycle, and in allowing Member States to borrow the resources necessary for stimulus packages at the bottom of the cycle. We are currently at the bottom of the cycle. Interest rates are definitely under pressure and are threatening the sustainability of the debt. This being the case, the European Central Bank was right to announce that it would buy back some debt to enable Member States to diversify their sources of finance. Nevertheless, in addition to the fact that this concept of sustainability has never been defined in the economic literature, can the risk premiums demanded by the markets be deemed justifiable? No, if we consider that risk in the mortgage derivatives market, just as in the public-debt market, is impossible to assess. This is why, in our report, we proposed that particular attention be paid to the structural deficit indicator rather than the focus being … (The President cut off the speaker)
 This is why, in our report, we proposed that particular attention be paid to the structural deficit indicator rather than the focus being on the current account deficit, the scale of which is due to the deterioration in the actual budget deficit. This is the result of the crisis, which has weakened growth and concomitant tax revenue. This revenue has also been adversely affected by the lowering of taxes, which did not have the expected impact on supply. Our report seeks to offer three recommendations combined with some operational indicators. The first is to maintain support measures until the recovery has been consolidated. The second is to monitor the structural deficits, which are still close to equilibrium, despite the deterioration in actual budget deficits, in order to send a reassuring signal to the markets as to the state of public finances. The third is to assess the efficiency of tax expenditure and, in particular, of certain tax reductions which are related to the fall in tax revenue. Unfortunately, for the liberals and the conservatives in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, common sense counts for little; the impact of the crisis counts for little; and the fact that the massive debt is also due to the bank bail-out plans counts for little. Only their blind faith in the efficiency of the financial markets counts; only dogmatic compliance with a manifestly out-of-date Stability Pact counts. They do not see any need to create the tools required for economic governance, which is essential in order to strengthen the Union. It is a case of putting Europe on a starvation diet and doggedly trying to meet the criteria in the pact without any guarantee of success and at the risk of destroying the recovery, and too bad for social cohesion. That is the position that they have defended in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Since that vote, the economic health of Europe has deteriorated further. The European Central Bank and the Commission have finally come up with monetary and budgetary instruments which should enable us to improve economic governance in the euro area. However, the markets have fallen once again, unsettled as they are by the austerity plans. The Ecofin Council had to start all over again on Monday. Against this background, the amendments which we are tabling are, all in all, very moderate; and we are tabling some new ones too. They argue for flexible implementation of the Stability Pact, so that an unwelcome austerity cure can be avoided. They advocate a public credit rating agency to shield Member States from the diktat of the markets. These are the signals that Parliament must send out. Mr Karas, the time for ideological knee-jerk reactions has passed, as has the time for short-term national electoral moves. Europe needs policies which are motivated by a real desire to strengthen the Union. If you and your group are not up to this task, if you are no longer capable of representing the general interest, you can be sure that our citizens will be able to draw their own conclusions, for the future of the euro area is now at stake. Liem Hoang Ngoc,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, two taboos have been broken in recent weeks. Firstly, the ECB can now monetise sovereign debts. Secondly, EU expenditure can now be financed by borrowing and, in particular, when the stabilisation and support funds are created. There is a third taboo, which unfortunately has not been broken, and it is the Stability and Growth Pact, which some Members of this House are dogmatically demanding be strengthened. Commissioners, we socialists are in favour of federalism. We are in favour of the coordination of budget policies. However, if the coordination of budget policies means overriding national parliaments so as to put their citizens on a starvation diet, then I fear that that might be a fine EU idea which will itself end up starving to death. This is the real threat which we are all facing at the moment. Commissioners, the austerity plans in Greece, Spain, Portugal and France do not have any chance of succeeding. I ask you to acknowledge this. Liem Hoang Ngoc,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Giegold’s report is particularly significant given the current macro-economic debate. This report is all the more relevant given the fact that its author is a German MEP who wanted to draw the attention of Europeans to the distorted effects, for the countries of the euro area, of the German strategy of reducing labour costs in the single currency system. The German Government is, in fact, about to drag the euro area and the whole of the European Union into generalised wage deflation with damaging macro-economic consequences. Particularly in the absence of consistent structural funds and sufficient budgetary resources, and faced with the impossibility of devaluation, Member States with current accounts in deficit are condemned, in order to resist, to trim their wages and reduce the perimeter of their social security systems. The result is firstly a slowdown in internal demand which, since the second quarter of 2008, has led to negative growth, and this was even before the start of the liquidity crisis. Secondly, we are seeing a rise in the personal debt of households with modest incomes and means, whose purchasing power is no longer increasing. Their debt to acquire homes was fed by the whole deregulated financial machinery, in Spain, in the United Kingdom and in Ireland, with the disastrous consequences we have observed in the subprime crisis. Ladies and gentlemen, listening to the debates in committee, a significant number of MEPs would seem to be forgetting the lessons of this crisis. This crisis is far from behind us. The current recovery is all the more fragile given the fact that Europe is continuing with wage deflation and the Commission, but also the President of the Eurogroup and the President of the European Central Bank – whom we heard on Monday – are calling on the Member States to prematurely adopt exit policies that are comparable to real austerity plans. These policies risk nipping growth in the bud when it has barely become positive again, even though capacity utilisation rates remain low. These policies will fail to reduce the deficits in Greece, in Spain and elsewhere, because the expected tax revenue will fail to materialise also. They will exacerbate unemployment and will fuel social tensions. The Giegold report has the merit of drawing attention to some of these macro-economic imbalances. Unfortunately, the final version, amended by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, refuses to condemn wage deflation. However, on the whole, the debate opened by Mr Giegold may be beneficial at a time when neoliberal dogma thrown into doubt by the crisis is back in force in Parliament, in the Council and in the Commission.

Mr President, Madam President, I thank Mrs Thun Und Hohenstein for the conscientiousness of her work and the overall quality of her report. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I am delighted that the vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has made it possible to integrate into the final report a number of ideas that we wanted to see emerge. The first is the need to adopt a more qualitative approach in respect of the implementation of the Internal Market Scoreboard, enabling the causes of the transposition deficit to be identified. We do not underestimate the usefulness of the statistical data and the pressure that comes from promoting the EU’s good and bad students, but in our opinion, the Commission ought to be more ambitious and try to make this scoreboard a tool designed to appreciate the difficulties encountered by the Member States within the context of the transposition process. All the more so since we all know that the transposition deficit may sometimes be due not to ill will by the Member States, but to the mediocre quality of the European legislation to be transposed. The second aspect I focused on is the need to strengthen dialogue between the Commission and the Member States throughout the transposition period. The more the information exchanges take place upstream, the more it will be possible to prevent the risk of non­transposition or incorrect transposition. The report does, however, pose a problem on one point: this relates to paragraph 10, which did not initially appear in Mrs Thun Und Hohenstein’s draft report. This paragraph proposes the creation of an internal market test for all new proposed legislation. We are strongly opposed to this since such a test seems to us to be pointless at best and dangerous at worst. Indeed, the review of any barriers to the internal market already takes place during the impact studies carried out by the European Commission with each new legislative proposal. We would not like this internal market test to be used as a pretext for undermining social or environmental advances. We could not agree to it in those circumstances. Liem Hoang Ngoc,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this period of crisis, public finances have been heavily used, initially to save the financial system and then to cushion the social and economic impact. In this context, there is much talk of public deficits, the spending of Member States is being attacked, but the fall in tax receipts is allowed to fade into the background. One forgets that, each year in the European Union, EUR 200 billion evades taxation, and these are resources which could have been used for essential recovery policies, resources which would allow us calmly to face up to what some are calling, in inverted commas, the demographic time bomb. This is why the texts that we are discussing today are so important. The introduction of common tools and absolute transparency between the Member States in the area of debt recovery are vital steps if we are to ensure that no citizen, no company, can evade their fiscal responsibility, and that everyone contributes to the collective effort. We must give the tax authorities of each country in the Union the resources to fulfil their missions. We must also emphasise the extent to which a healthy fiscal policy is essential. Everyone is currently concerned about Greece. We are seeing today the extremes to which the lack of an effective fiscal apparatus leads. It is not merely the crisis that is harming the Karamanlis government; it is, above all, its predecessor’s lack of political courage in failing to reform Greece’s fiscal administration and thus to create an effective tax recovery tool. We hope, in this matter, that the Union will use all of the resources at its disposal to confirm its solidarity with Greece. I hope that the vote we take on Wednesday confirms the vote in committee and results in some encouraging tax recovery texts. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

Mr President, to my mind, the Commission’s proposed Agenda for Change raises many questions, chief amongst them the matter of how exactly the principle of differentiation is to be applied. The Commission’s wish is that, from 2014, the countries receiving EU development aid should be chosen purely on the basis of the criterion of per capita wealth. As Baroness Ashton has said, this is not just a matter of money; it merits a proper policy debate on how we define our priorities for international cooperation. And I do not think this differentiated approach is consistent with the spirit of the Cotonou Agreement. I firmly believe that those ACP countries that have recorded good economic performances should be encouraged in their transition towards more sustainable growth; they should not be improperly penalised for having managed to secure growth through discipline, good governance and prudent economic policy.

Mr President, all of us are well aware of how tedious and time-consuming negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) can be. My feeling is that this has indeed been the case with this issue. On the one hand, it is not hard to see that only 18 of the 36 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries which have embarked on or signed an EPA have ratified it. The remainder are therefore encouraged to conclude and implement an agreement quickly, if they do not want to see their negotiation efforts ruined by, for example, the deadline of 2014. On the other hand, we have all known, since 2007, that this regulation was merely temporary, being incompatible with the rules of the World Trade Organisation. These facts therefore lead me to believe that our rapporteur’s proposal is the best possible compromise if we want to give the Commission services and the ACP countries the time they need to conclude their EPA negotiations. Nevertheless, if the date 1 January 2016 does not win a majority in tomorrow’s vote, I would call on my fellow MEPs to reject the Commission’s proposal. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank our two rapporteurs for the work they have done on this issue. It was necessary because we started from a very low base with the Commission’s basic proposal: no specific mention of the outermost regions, which are directly affected by competition from Latin American countries; no automatic activation of the stabilisation mechanism; no possibility for Parliament to ask for a safeguard investigation to be initiated; non-compliance of social and environmental standards as possibly constituting an unfair competitive advantage. That is why it is extremely important that tomorrow’s vote validates the progress made on these points in the Committee on International Trade (INTA). Nonetheless, it is not sufficient, because we know that the activation thresholds for both these regulations are so high that they render these mechanisms practically inoperable. Furthermore, the Commission must provide for an additional financial envelope to support EU banana production. We must bear in mind that numerous jobs are at stake in these European regions, which already have record unemployment rates. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

Like all compromises, this is no exception. Although it is satisfactory from a strictly commercial point of view, it is far from perfect, because we must bear in mind that this regulation is aimed at developing countries. By developing its new paradigm of differentiation, the Commission says that it wants to refocus its activities to help the poorest countries. At first sight, this seems to be completely acceptable to us. However, in order to achieve this, the Commission has developed a strictly accounting approach that is based upon the sole criterion of GDP per capita. We can clearly see the limits of this approach. What about the numerous middle income developing countries whose economies are not very diversified and which are vulnerable to climatic uncertainties? The compromise found with the Council does not resolve this issue and that is why I call upon my colleagues to vote in favour of the three amendments that will be tabled on this text.

 I welcome the position adopted by Parliament today. I would like to address two key points in this report. It was important that Parliament spoke out strongly against the Commission’s proposal to reduce the specific allocation for outermost regions (ORs) by almost half. This cut in funding is all the more unfair in that it affects the money set aside to compensate for the disadvantages of these regions which, by definition, are not decreasing. They are described as structural and permanent in our Treaties. Consequently, these regions would be the only territories, and I mean the only ones, under the cohesion policy that would see a cut in their funds, which would not be justified by growth effects or a change in category of regions. Secondly, I would like to focus on our call for a comparative analysis of pricing in these regions. Economic mechanisms that go against the principles of the single market seem to be at work here and often lead to extremely worrying social movements. In this area, we need to have better informed and targeted action to meet this urgent demand of the people. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Commissioner, this initiative comes from a good place. Work on education and training must be a priority when it is not only essential for the employability of our young people but also an investment for the future, a gauge of our ability to maintain dynamic and sustainable development. That being said, I am still extremely dubious about how consistent European action is overall. If the EU is not capable of implementing real solutions for growth, if it is still obsessed with punitive austerity, sterile austerity, austerity for austerity’s sake, there will be no growth for small and medium-sized enterprises, no jobs for young people and all of our efforts will be in vain. Similarly, if the fight against youth unemployment is our priority, how do you explain your proposal to reduce certain funds dedicated to the outermost regions by almost 50%, Commissioner? These regions where youth unemployment is at over 60%, these regions which you promised to protect, find themselves being sanctioned more than any others. Where is the consistency? Where is the justice? This decision is unacceptable and we are against. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

 This DCI/BAM text brushes aside the mandate that was given to Parliament’s negotiating team, which was to observe the spirit and the letter of the Treaty of Lisbon, to place Parliament on an equal footing with the Council in all programming decisions relating to the choice of strategic priorities and financial allocations, and not to set a negative precedent for Parliament prior to the forthcoming negotiations on the future external aid financing instruments 2014-2020. By applying Article 291 TFEU on strategic programming decisions, Parliament’s power of scrutiny will be more limited than it was with the comitology procedure under the old Treaty. All this is a result of the shameful blackmail by the Council, which was threatening to block the entire package of measures if Parliament rejected any one of the four texts that were voted on. I therefore voted against this text, because our Parliament had a duty to defend its rights as set out in the Treaty of Lisbon, whilst demonstrating that its plenary remained sovereign in the face of the Council’s efforts at destabilisation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our coordinator Thijs Berman could not be with us in the end this evening for personal reasons. However, I know that he shares my views on this issue fully. The conciliation on this legislative package was tedious and time-consuming and, while the outcome on the human rights instrument and the enlarged Industrialised Countries Instrument (ICI Plus) is satisfactory, we still have a very long way to go with regard to the Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM). The compromise reached on this text thus brushes aside the mandate that was given to our negotiating team, which was to place Parliament on an equal footing with the Council in all of the programming decisions relating to the choice of strategic priorities and financial allocations. I say this because it is indeed Parliament’s powers and the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon itself that are we are talking about here. The choice of programming priorities is a highly political decision, in which our Parliament must have its say. By categorically refusing to grant Parliament any such power of oversight and by employing shameful blackmailing tactics, the Council has, once again, made a reprehensible ideological withdrawal. Member States must, however, understand that the European Union’s external actions are now a responsibility that is shared between our institutions. That is why Parliament must retain its authority and reject the proposal on the BAM. This is the only means we have of showing the Council and the Commission that Parliament wishes to see greater transparency in Community decisions. If we lose this battle, it could lead to an absurd situation in which we would have to wait for a new Treaty in order to obtain, at long last, the powers that are in fact already conferred on us by the Treaty of Lisbon.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to highlight Parliament’s support for the creation of a category of intermediate regions and I would point out that this will in no way – contrary to what some have said – be an additional burden on the Community budget. What we are proposing here is a revolution in the concept of transition with an unchanged budget. Our desire is to move towards a fairer system which helps those regions that have substantial difficulties. This transitional zone between 75 and 90% of European GDP is a real commitment towards a consolidated cohesion policy for the years to come. Furthermore, I am delighted that our resolution has confirmed Parliament’s commitment towards the outermost regions. The latter are subject to specific and permanent disadvantages which justify this solidarity effort, in order for them to effectively be the Union’s interface with the world. Patrice Tirolien,

 Madam President, the position unanimously adopted today by our Parliament shows just how vitally important the issue of implementing powers is to this House. Nevertheless, to turn to the subject of the Banana Accompanying Measures, this agreement is embarrassing with regard to our ACP banana-producing partners. Indeed, one year after these countries legitimately obtained compensation from the Commission, they have still not received the funds, even though the Geneva Agreement is hitting them hard. Therefore, they are the ones I am addressing again today when I say that it is precisely because we want to relay our demands even further that this House must have its say in the EU’s strategy and general guidelines for external aid. We are determined not to fall into the trap set by the Commission and the Council. Transparency of European decisions must be at the heart of our work. This is the very spirit of the Treaty and the essence of history. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D
),  
in writing. 
– (FR)
 It is impossible to separate the Geneva Agreement from the other agreements that the Commission has subsequently negotiated. Shortly after the Geneva Agreement was signed, Colombia and Peru obtained a greater tariff reduction, thus proving that the agreement provides no legal certainty and has not settled the banana dispute as it claims. This differential treatment prompted Ecuador and Guatemala to demand equal treatment and threaten to lodge further appeals at the WTO. Furthermore, this agreement seriously harms a sector that provides countless jobs not only in our ACP partner countries but also in the outermost regions (ORs). The aid the EU is providing to support producers in the ORs has been calculated on the basis of the laws approved at the WTO in 2006. However, neither the December 2009 agreement nor the agreement with the Andean countries was anticipated in the POSEI. As for the aid earmarked for ACP producers, it is not sufficient to enable them to adapt to the new tariff situation. To give one’s assent to this agreement is to support the Commission in a strategy that is inconsistent with the EU’s effort in favour of the ORs and the ACP countries. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to focus my speech on Mr Goerens’ report, which deals with the ACP Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM). As I myself come from one of the only European regions to produce bananas, I can only show solidarity with the ACP producers in question. Solidarity, first and foremost, because a strong historical link unites the European Union to these countries, and we should do our utmost to ensure that they, too, are able to maximise the benefits of globalisation, of which they are, more often than not, the first victims. Solidarity, also, because the trade concessions generously granted by the Commission to the WTO are in danger of dealing a fatal blow to this agricultural sector in our ACP partner countries. Solidarity, but definitely not naivety, lastly, since the proposal for a BAM regulation as tabled by the Commission put much too much emphasis on the economic diversification aspect. Given the loss of tariff preference that resulted from the WTO agreement, this programme’s main goal is clearly to ensure the sustainability of ACP banana exports and hence, to help make them competitive. Furthermore, let us be honest, the funds set aside by the BAM are by no means enough and do not extend over a long enough period to make diversification happen. Finally, I would add that, if we are aware of the urgency of the situation, we can accept these accompanying measures being financed through the extensive redeployment of heading IV of the budget. The Council must be responsible and work towards finding a viable solution for the multiannual financing of this programme. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome this debate today. It once again shows the need for the Union to appreciate and make the most of its regional diversity. At this time when we are negotiating the new 2014-2020 framework programmes, I think it important to emphasise the amendments from which specific regions must benefit. Issues of continuity and territorial cohesion must be at the heart of our concerns. The development of mountain regions, islands and sparsely populated areas, however, requires more than just a set of derogations. We must adopt a horizontal approach. We must put in place instruments capable of making Union action in all areas coexist in synergy, thereby increasing their added value. Moreover, as a representative of an outlying region, I look forward to the new Union strategy on the outermost regions, which the Commission services have promised for early 2011.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when this text came before the Committee on Regional Development, I managed to introduce the idea of an extension of the exemption authorising the production of reconstituted milk in Martinique and Guadeloupe, following the example of the sustainable growth model which proved its worth in Madeira. Unfortunately, there was no consensus on this position at the last trialogue. This is regrettable for two reasons. Firstly, in terms of substance, dairy production in the French overseas departments would offer multiple unmissable opportunities: the strengthening of the cattle industry, self-sufficiency in a basic foodstuff and the creation of jobs. Secondly, in terms of content, our Parliament as a whole was unable to reach a decision on my proposal since it wanted to pass this text at first reading via an informal procedure that I oppose. Be that as it may, our work on this POSEI regulation will continue very soon during the mid-term review of this regulation. At that point, I will again request an exemption in the other French overseas departments. Patrice Tirolien  (S&amp;D

Mr President, is Haiti condemned to misfortune? Since its independence, natural disasters have given way to political catastrophes there, and here we are today faced with a tragedy of historic proportions. There are dead, injured, countless destroyed buildings and the ruin of national political structures and cooperation structures. We must beat fate. The European Union must participate in this twin emergency and reconstruction effort. We owe it to our numerous ties with Haiti, ties that are, first and foremost, historic: a former colony, Haiti was the most prosperous of them all; secondly, diplomatic: the Cotonou Agreement makes the island a privileged partner; and, finally, geographical, since Haiti is a neighbour of the European Union thanks to the outermost regions. Moreover, the crisis in Haiti represents the first test of the new European External Action Service, which you head up, Mrs Ashton. That has been conclusive up to now. This disaster also underlines the challenges and the improvements that we must make to this structure, since the solidarity movement of our continent aside, the US reaction raises questions about our mobilisation capacity. Thus, the remarkable efforts in favour of European coordination, the Member States’ contributions, must not conceal the difficulty of the discussions concerning the deployment of the European Gendarmerie Force. While it is crucial for the European Union’s expenditure to be guided by the United Nations, these difficulties lead to the conclusion that the European Union must equip itself with an autonomous, integrated structure with the means to deal with tasks as complex as a humanitarian emergency. Finally, the reconstruction phase represents an immense challenge. There is no shortage of tasks: political, administrative, economic, social and environmental. We are perhaps at year zero of a new era for Haiti. This is a major political challenge for a Europe that must assert itself as a visible leader in this process. Patrice Tirolien,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Guinea is currently being rocked by tragic events that have shocked the international public and flouted the law. Indeed, on 28 September 2009, the military junta led by Captain Dadis Camara carried out the bloody repression of a peaceful demonstration bringing together all of the opposition parties. Now, the Cotonou agreements base relations between the European Union and its ACP partners on respect for human rights and democratic principles. Therefore, Captain Dadis Camara’s unilateral decision to postpone the elections and to refuse to raise the issue of his candidacy for Guinean president is a serious failure to honour the commitments made to hold free and transparent elections within one year. The European Union must therefore take immediate action in line with the principles and the permanent values that underpin its action so that this violence, which represents so many human rights violations, stops. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the compromise resolution is fully in line with our values and principles, but I am particularly anxious to emphasise here Article 10 of this text, namely the suspension of the fisheries agreement protocol between the European Union and the Republic of Guinea until the democratic process has begun. I can hear people wondering whether such a decision would have disastrous socio-economic consequences for the population but, faced with the violence of 28 September, we must recognise that the Guinean Government is scarcely concerned about the living conditions of its citizens and that it leaves us with no other option than to be firm. Since its independence in 1958, Guinea has only ever known dictatorial regimes. Patrice Tirolien,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.
 – (FR) 
Mr President, the worrying developments concerning the political situation and security in Guinea require a firm response by the European Union. Indeed, as you know, on 28 September 2009, troops under the Guinean Government carried out the bloody repression of a peaceful demonstration uniting all of the opposition parties, causing 157 deaths and injuring more than a thousand people, some of whom suffered particularly vile instances of rape and mutilation. The Republic of Guinea is a country that has experienced only two dictatorial regimes since its independence in 1958. It is time for this infernal spiral to come to an end. The European Union, its Member States and its institutions had already condemned Moussa Dadis Camara’s coup d'état
 on 28 December 2008. As is procedure, the Council then applied Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement to establish a road map with the Guinean authorities, to be used as a framework for democratic transition. This list of measures included, in particular, the organisation of free and transparent elections within a year and the commitment that members of the CNDD, notably Moussa Dadis Camara, would not stand in these elections. Captain Camara’s decision to postpone the organisation of elections until spring 2010 and his refusal to raise the issue of whether he would stand for the Guinean Presidency were a sign of what was to come, with the current escalation. Thus, the demonstration that was bloodily repressed on 28 September was aimed precisely at calling on the junta to honour its commitments. The reaction of the government in office in Conakry shows its true intentions quite clearly: to eliminate all forms of democratic opposition in order to remain in power. In response, the international community has unanimously condemned these violent actions and the Guinean regime. Outraged by these massacres, our Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries recently refused, quite rightly, to vote for the Fisheries Agreement between the European Union and Guinea. Today, and in light of the latest events, the European Parliament would like to know the decisions the Council intends to take to address this situation. First of all, does the Council intend to push for the creation of an international commission of inquiry on the events of 28 September? How does the Council intend to act to ensure that the CNDD respects its commitments, namely to organise free and transparent elections as soon as possible, without the participation of Moussa Dadis Camara or another member of the CNDD? With regard to Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, what measures does the Council intend to take against the Guinean junta? Finally, what concrete commitments has the Council made to support the different initiatives run by ECOWAS, the African Union and the International Contact Group on Guinea? Pervenche Berès,

 Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs sees this end-of-year meeting as of major significance, since in order to achieve a genuine economic and monetary union we must revisit its foundations, which clearly did not withstand the crisis in which we find ourselves. The work done by this Parliament, under the responsibility of Ms Thyssen – whom we all thank for the excellent quality of the work – is meant to make clear, to define, Parliament’s position with a view to this major European Council meeting in December. I am therefore surprised by the absence of Herman Van Rompuy, its President, for whom this work is intended. In addition, I consider that the result of our vote here will give our sherpas a mandate to represent us in the negotiations in preparation for this work. We also consider that this meeting cannot be downplayed or underestimated in the light of the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework. Rewriting a genuine economic and monetary union must remain the priority. In this area, it is necessary to raise the social issue: we have been greatly struck by the fact that the document put on the table by Mr Van Rompuy in June defines four pillars, without ever mentioning the social dimension. Yet if you look at the Treaty of Maastricht, if you look at the current state of economic and monetary union, it is obvious that there is an imbalance between the economic policies defined in Article 121 and the employment policies defined in Article 148. However, if you rebuild economic and monetary union on the basis of Mr Van Rompuy’s proposals, without taking account of this original balance, you will destabilise the entire mechanism. Moreover, Parliament, our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, also sets great store by parliamentary control, democratic control, and therefore the chance for Parliament to participate, under the ordinary legislative procedure, in the Annual Growth Survey establishing the framework for this European Semester. A final point, Mr President, to highlight an element not mentioned often enough. If we want the troikas to succeed, they must be expanded to include the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which has today denounced the failure to abide by the ILO fundamental conventions in Greece, following the work of the troika. A genuine economic and monetary union cannot ignore the very foundations of the European social model. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, here are three debates one after the other in our order of business, in which you are at the heart of the discussion. You have led some of these debates with Commissioner Andor, which is right, as they discuss industrial policy, which is also at the heart of European jobs. However, a key figure is missing from your debate – that is, Commissioner Barnier – because it is evident that, behind several strategies that are at play, it is strategies for financing the economy that lead to the unravelling of the industrial fabric of our regions, and it is also the stitch you will need to knit, if you will permit the expression. I therefore thank you for having taken the initiative of this working group, which is a logical link between the reasoning on raw materials and that on the car industry. What is required is a global strategy that combines the issue of research and development with the issue of quality and jobs. I am always struck by the extent to which Europeans have been mobilised and shocked at the idea that they could no longer control access to rare earths as if it were a strategic issue, rather like what the Americans have sometimes done. Yet when considering the issue of iron and steel, Europeans do not consider it just as strategic for our economies. We allow Mr Mittal to behave simply like a financier and, contrary to everything we have learned in our economics textbooks, rather than create added value, he tries to go up the added value chain by destabilising and destroying production units on the European sites so he can go and buy mines, where he can organise speculation better. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament will, in adopting Mr Ferber’s report, draw important lessons from MiFID I by adopting a text that ensures that almost all financial transactions will have to take place on regulated venues. That is the meaning we must give this text. High-frequency trading, a technique allowing a large number of orders to be executed in a few milliseconds, will now be highly constrained. The crisis has brought to light the abusive practices linked to the use of high-frequency trading by some financial players, disrupting the functioning of financial markets to obtain considerable profits. The position adopted by Parliament is a move in the right direction by discouraging use of this practice; it will help to put finance back where it belongs, that is to say, serving the real economy and long-term investment. With this report, Parliament also wishes to tackle food speculation, which can be devastating for entire populations, by introducing position limits for the various players operating on trading venues. The destabilising effects of commodity speculation are increasingly clear, particularly on foodstuff markets. With this in mind, the proposals adopted today are a first step in the right direction, insofar as they impose limits on positions that may be taken by those operating on trading venues. This report also allows us to take a significant step forward: the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will be able to intervene to prohibit the sale of certain financial products acknowledged as toxic to the economy. In conclusion, I would like to talk about an important point linking the discussion on MiFID I and the text we are going to adopt here. When considering MiFID I, Parliament’s main contribution concerned, the issue of advice that investors, particularly small investors, must be given when undertaking an investment. Financing conditions for such advice remain a point of discussion on which we must provide clarity to ensure that everyone, irrespective of income, may access such advice on terms that are transparent and actually enable them to invest on an informed basis.

Mr President, I hesitate somewhat in giving Mr Eppink the opportunity to speak even more. All the same, I would like to give him the chance to correct what he said with regard to the latest International Monetary Fund observations, because, on reading carefully –
 as you clearly have not –
 what the IMF says about the European situation it is exactly the opposite of what you said. In fact, the IMF tells us that the policies currently being followed will lead to more austerity, something which, moreover, can be seen by any person who is intellectually honest –

Mr President, Commissioner De Gucht, could you tell Commissioners Rehn and Andor that this Parliament takes the European Semester procedure seriously? To that end, when, on 28 November, the Commission puts on the table the annual growth review, which will serve as our underlying thread for 2013, we would like them to have several messages in mind. Firstly, to take account of the Growth Pact called for by the Heads of State or Government, on 28 and 29 June; next, the lessons from what the International Monetary Fund tells us, namely that a roadmap based only on austerity clearly has no chance of getting the European Union moving again.  Lastly, we think that the purpose of having an annual growth review and a definition of a European vision worked out before the European Council is to gain the means not simply to condemn each Member State in relation to its budgetary policy but also to draw up a common roadmap, enabling us, for instance, to correct macroeconomic imbalances. Please tell your colleagues that we would like two important things. The first is the possibility for Parliament to be involved in defining this European roadmap. For that we need a document we are able to amend, even though, formally, we do not currently have powers of codecision. Then, if the Member States are required, alongside national reform programmes and stability and convergence programmes, to submit national programmes for jobs, these documents must then be taken seriously. Member States that do not take them seriously must be penalised or, at least, called on to do so with a vigilance not shown by Mr Rehn this year.

Mr President, clearly, Mr Eppink thinks it necessary to play tit for tat and I would willingly tell him that he should know the French situation better and that, clearly, the rules that apply here do not necessarily do so elsewhere. In particular, the country from which I come and which you undoubtedly do not know as well as I do, is one where the demographic situation is nothing like that seen in other European countries, which makes it possible, in a difficult climate in which the President of the French Republic is seeking to re-establish conditions for a fruitful social dialogue to conduct reform, to have a mandate based on a decision imposed in relation to the record of his predecessor.

Mr President, the keystone of the European Union, the dimension that was lauded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, is solidarity. However, there can be no solidarity without money, without a budget. We know today that over the past 14 years the national budgets have increased, on average, more rapidly than the European Union budget, and now the Member States want the EU budget to decrease more rapidly then theirs. Moreover, President Barroso wants the social model to be the spearhead of our competitiveness. The International Monetary Fund tells us that the austerity policy that we are implementing is counterproductive. Day after day, we ask the Member States to carry out structural reforms. The first of these involves investment in human capital. I do not like that expression but it is what it says. Our greatest asset is the quality of our men and women. In that regard, in the next budget, if we do not succeed in building a wall to consolidate social spending, allocating 25 % of cohesion policy funds to the European Social Fund, we will be on the wrong track and we will not be preparing the European Union to cope with the challenges that lie ahead. In the same spirit, we must defend the programme for the most deprived persons and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. Pervenche Berès,

Mr President, I am going to speak on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the report by Ms Auconie on a proposal to support European Social Entrepreneurship Funds. Last week, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, in an excellent conference organised by Commissioner Andor, emphasised that the European social model was an element of EU competitiveness and that social entrepreneurship clearly formed part of this. The proposal we have on the table is therefore welcome. However, I think that we must ensure – and that was the subject matter of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL) – that, through these social entrepreneurship funds, we do not create new niches in financial markets. I have to say that, from this point of view, we have two concerns. We had asked in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that the issue of social housing be treated specifically, and I think that that would have been valuable. Finally, I have to say that the response from the Commissioner representing Commissioner Barnier on the establishment of such funds in tax havens is, in my view, problematic, as, once again, it is not a question of creating new niches or nouveaux riches but of fostering a new, highly promising sector, that of the social market economy, through social entrepreneurship.

Mr President, Mr Hökmark, have you read the Treaty on European Union? It does not talk about a market economy, but about a social market economy. Of all the Union’s values, you only mentioned values and democracy. However, the latter must be enshrined in its social dimension, in social protection, in social dialogue and in collective bargaining, which you clearly seem to be completely ignoring. When you talk about monopolies, are you also thinking about the private monopolies that can bring countries to their knees, such as Goldman Sachs in Greece? When you talk about the internal market, do you have an overall vision of the internal market, a vision of the internal market that we need, that is to say, an internal market that also comprises fiscal and social harmonisation? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, we already had the opportunity to address this issue in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on Monday evening. I would like to make several comments. The first is that, in these country-specific recommendations that you have just made, we basically believe that the fundamental question that should be settled, were all these recommendations to be implemented, is that of macro-economic imbalances within the Union. When you examine this jigsaw of recommendations, you wonder whether we really do have all the tools we need to correct these macro-economic imbalances, whether, in particular, we can make the management of the euro area as a whole as effective as we would like it to be. Then, when I look at the specific recommendations that you have made for France, a country with which I am well acquainted, I am struck by the fact that at no time did you say that these recommendations had been made on the basis of a document submitted to you by a government since defeated in the elections. In this document, you are acting on the results of five years of Presidency by Nicolas Sarkozy. You say that, over five years, France lost 19.4% of its external competitiveness. The French people’s response to that is to say that they would like VAT to be revised, the pension reform to be revised and the minimum wage boosted. However, you say precisely the opposite in the recommendations that you make to this country. That raises an issue of democracy. Mr Hughes has already said this in the name of my group, but I shall say it again in this particular instance. We shall not succeed collectively if, in the Member States, we feel that there is a diktat drawn up in Brussels which ignores the political realities of our countries. You must answer this question. In this Parliament, as you know, we are all in favour of integration, of greater strength together at a European level, because we know that only together shall we be able to recover. However, if you do this against the people, against their political choices, we shall go to the wall. You must answer this question, Commissioner. Pervenche Berès,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the European Parliament wanted to organise this debate based on the employment package that you have placed on the Commission’s table and which we feel it is important to talk about here today, in plenary, at a time when the European Council may well mention a growth initiative, alongside other weighty matters which will be on its work table. With regard to that growth initiative, we think that your voice – which says that this growth must create jobs – should be strong, hence the importance of this debate that we are organising today. When we look at the expectations of Europeans, at the time when the unemployment rate is approaching an historic record, it is not so much stabilising financial markets, but keeping or finding a job that concerns them more than anything. It is this expectation that we must respond to, especially when it comes to the youngest citizens. This hope bumps up against the realities of a social situation that is intensifying by the day. How, indeed, can we fail to foresee the spectre of a lost generation when we know that 5.6 million young people are unemployed, that one young European out of five is looking for work and that the situation may not improve before 2016, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The European Commission repeats that it will take some time before guidelines produce effects in terms of job creation. However, for this to happen, the guidelines must be the right ones. It is striking to see that in the national reform programmes that the Member States have sent to the Commission, ultimately, their commitment to present their national employment plans has not really been followed up with results. Many have not implemented this proposal. I would like to retain two proposals from this employment package that you have put on the table that we think are right at the heart of the discussion that we need to have. Firstly, the taboo that you have ended when it comes to the minimum wage. You said that the minimum wage is an important element in the debate for combating poverty and social exclusion, for combating social dumping, and for putting forward the question of aggregate demand, of stimulating internal demand. It is a major topic if we wish to solve the problems of internal imbalances within the European Union. Next, there is a second proposal that you seem to support, for which you know that Parliament will give you its backing, and that is this idea of a Youth Guarantee, which means that no young person would be without employment, education or training after four months in the labour market. This is a major proposal. If we want to commit to specific proposals that go beyond mere words, we must move forward on this in the coming months in terms of financial perspectives and the conclusions of the next European Council, and we will be by your side to do this. Thank you, Commissioner, for the process into which, together, we will be able to breathe life so that we may correct a strategy which, for too long, has been one of austerity and which is leading us towards disaster.

 Mr President, Ms Vestager, Mr Rehn, with these two reports, I think the important message that Parliament can bring to your work is that we must begin to improve consistency, since we can plainly see that the crisis we are sinking into, or have already sunk into, requires us to be perhaps a little more consistent. We cannot demand a lot from certain Member States and, at the same time, give nothing back, and we cannot wait until the end of the whole affair to reward them for their efforts. It is entirely a matter of governance – modern, intelligent governance adapted to the reality and severity of the crisis facing us. To achieve this consistency, when we draw up our economic policies, we must bear in mind everything we have learnt and everything we know about the extent of the macro-economic imbalances and the need to correct them. That means that the policies introduced must be evaluated, in terms of timing and criteria, according to how well they address these macro-economic imbalances. Secondly, Ms Vestager, the banking union question will clearly be at the heart of the discussions at the European Council on 28 and 29 June. The message I think this Parliament can give there, particularly with Ms Ferreira’s report, is one of balance. There must be a balance between a new approach in the Council debate to the challenges of growth, of which we are one of the main axes in Ms Ferreira’s report – which I hope will be given considerable support by this Chamber – and managing the debt issue. This balance between the way the debt question is addressed and the need for real growth – not merely internal market liberalisation but, above all, growth aiming at the long term and at investment – will at last enable us to give Europeans new hope.

 Mr President, Ms Vestager, Commissioner, when discussing a proposal on financial regulation, in a very classical way, two arguments are put forward. The first is that it is only possible to act on the largest possible scale, if possible on a global scale, and that any descent to a lower level would lead to a risk of unfair competition. The second argument is to say, ‘Oh, no, but certain products, which are safe, have to be excluded’. I would simply remind our fellow Members of the commitments made by the European Union, in particular through the members participating in the G20, who, in London, in April 2009, said, ‘We have decided that all financial institutions, markets and products of systemic importance should be subject to an appropriate level of regulation and supervision’. It seems to me that the taxation of financial transactions must also, under these conditions, cover undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and pension funds, that the level of intervention at which we will be able to launch this proposal will be the correct level of intervention, and that the issue of risks must be assessed on a global scale and not simply always to protect them.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs wanted to ask this question, and it did not know at the time that, on the very day on which we were to debate it, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) would bring out global youth unemployment figures, with 75 million young people unemployed and a red card for the European Union, within which 7.5 million young people between the ages of 15 and 24 are currently neither in a job nor in education or training. The European Union comes bottom of the class worldwide. Yet, when I look at the challenges facing the European Union, throughout the world, here and elsewhere, all day long, we say that Europe must meet the challenge of innovation, that it is innovation, that it is – a phrase I do not like – our human capital which will enable us to win the battle of globalisation. Yet, if that is the diagnosis we are making, how can we leave outside the labour market and exclude an entire generation? It is the whole question of the social impact of this crisis, which is not taken into account, which is neglected, which is regarded as a secondary issue. We are taking a collective risk, the consequences of which we are already seeing in a number of countries. The European Commission therefore set up eight Action Teams in eight of our Member States – Italy, Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Latvia, Spain, Lithuania and Slovakia – so that the European Union could mobilise its actions and its teams in these countries in order to meet this challenge in particular. Our questions to you, Commissioner, are therefore as follows. What are your conclusions? What proposals are you making? Where do you stand on this? We will support you whenever useful proposals are made to address this issue. However, we cannot accept the fact that youth unemployment rose from 14.7% in 2008 to 22.1% in 2011 and that, in many of our countries – as we know – almost half of young people are outside the labour market. We need what we have defined together as the goals of the EU 2020 strategy, which, it seems to me, has not aged a bit from that point of view, to be followed by actions. Yet, in this strategy – need I remind you – we said that we wanted early school leaving to be reduced to 10% of young people. We said that 40% of 30-34 year-olds would be required to have a qualifying diploma. What is happening in this regard? The proposals are on the table. I have taken note of the conclusions of the Council of 11 May 2012 with regard to strengthening the creative potential and innovation of young people. There is an urgent need for the EU to work towards this end. When the European Parliament, in particular, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, has examined the report by Jutta Steinruck on the EU programme for social change and innovation, it will submit proposals to you to enable us to finance a Youth Guarantee so that young people, when they leave the school system or when they lose their job, are no more than four months without work, without a training proposal or without an apprenticeship proposal. Those are the elements we want to discuss with you, Commissioner. We are convinced that this issue is a challenge for this generation of young people, the objective being to prevent them from becoming the excluded of tomorrow. However, it is also a challenge for our entire society, for the benefit of which we must take action. Commissioner, I know that, in this regard, we can count on your vigilance and the fact that you are a force for bringing forward proposals. This is a good opportunity to debate these elements and to make forward-looking proposals. (Applause) Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since, at this European Council, we ought to be talking openly and putting all our cards on the table, it seems to me that the state of the euro area means we should be thinking about things in three stages: the short term being the urgency of the situation in Greece, the medium term being a strategy for growth and the long term our vision of the euro area and us ‘living together’. In the short term, for Greece, we should realise that all those who thought that Greece could have a smooth exit from the euro area are being totally unrealistic; we have no Great Wall of China to protect us should Greece leave the euro area. Although we should also recognise that, in the Greek situation, nothing will be resolved if we continue to implement the troika’s mandate, which the Greeks rejected today. If we do not think things through, then nothing will be possible; there will be no general framework for an economic recovery, no hope restored, no dialogue and no solidarity at European level, be it in Greece or at European level. Commissioner, as you know, Mr Hollande’s election offers a rare window of opportunity to raise these issues again under new conditions. I do not agree with Mr Ferber when he said that there is only one model in Europe, the German model. We are a union built on diversity. Therefore, grab this window of opportunity that you have been given to finally provide Europe with all the answers it needs. These answers include a growth strategy, but not just any growth strategy. It should look beyond the internal market to avoid the traps of negative integration. These solutions should also include a genuine industrial policy, enabling us to make the investments we need to make our Europe a sustainable Europe, where jobs are created, where the main waste is not this generation currently being squeezed out of the labour market. You must admit then, Commissioner, that the way in which pressure is currently being put on Greece to reorganise its administration, while nothing is being done to help it with its negotiations with Switzerland, to put an end to the tax evasion performed by the privileged few in this country, is a source of injustice that neither the Greeks nor the Europeans, nor the French, nor the British nor the Germans should accept.

We have already said that we believe that the conditions under which sovereign debt is financed must be rethought. This is one of the possibilities on the table, but I am not prejudging a discussion that should be had and which should help relieve the financing of sovereign debt in countries like Greece and beyond.

 Mr Mitchell, I believe that the notion of showing respect for those who show solidarity is the basis on which we can all live together at European level. I also think that, in the case of your country, significant efforts have been made that have allowed you to recover from the difficult situation in which you found yourselves, but the contributions of a country like Ireland to what is the euro area is an issue which raises many other things that need to be put on the table. I should like to take this opportunity to say a few words about whether or not we should have taken note of the phenomena of rising prices and building bubbles over recent years. I see that, in your country, they managed to create a property bubble without stopping it in time. This is exactly the type of situation that we need to prevent. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I know the rules of this House. However, I would simply like to inform all of my colleagues about the vote that has just taken place. This item was added to the agenda on Monday and, clearly, most of my colleagues in the various groups did not know what they were voting on. That is why I abstained on most of the items in this resolution. I think that we have real difficulty here in terms of our working method. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

Mr President, Mr Rehn, Commissioner, the fact that you are taking part with us in this debate on employment rights in a Europe of open borders implies, I imagine, that you have something to say on the subject in addition to your role of listening to the speeches. I must tell you, Commissioner, that you and I are very different, because whereas I am a lay person, to hear you speak, I sometimes get the impression that you belong to some sect or church that preaches austerity as its dogma. As a lay person, I rely on evidence. When I look at the current situation in Spain – a country that has conscientiously followed the Stability and Growth Pact and implemented all the Commission’s prescriptions, even when President Zapatero was in power – six million people are unemployed in the country today. Then I ask you, Commissioner: are the employment rights that we are talking about only valid during untroubled times, and in times of crisis must the Troika go to Greece to impose an austerity plan that totally ignores the strength of our social model and the important role of industrial relations in helping us come through the economic crisis? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Commissioner, my point is that at the time, Mr Sarkozy and Ms Merkel wanted to divide the socialists by using Mr Zapatero as an example against other socialist examples. Clearly, this is not the issue. The issue is whether or not healthy public finances can be restored in a country with no growth. The issue is not whether the problem is with the regions or with central government: the issue is growth for job creation. Commissioner, do you think this recipe will succeed in Greece when basically, from the workers’ point of view and that of the Greek people themselves, what you are proposing is for investment plans to be implemented by large German companies, and that Greeks should take advantage of their freedom of movement. That is tantamount to an organised brain drain. Do you really think that is the right way? Do you not think that, at the end of the day, there comes a time when one needs to admit that there has been a mistake? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, you said you were, on balance, in favour of the mutualisation of debt. You must tell us the steps you have taken in this regard and, more importantly, whether you think this mutualisation is useful and necessary or whether you are perhaps reacting to the new proposal made by Eurex which, in reality, destroys the European Union’s internal capital markets, allows speculation against a Member State and further diminishes the prospect of mutualising debt. In addition, Mr Barroso, I would like to know whether you have been informed by the outgoing French Government of the conditions for assessing France’s National Reform Programme and its Stability and Convergence Programme this year, given this country’s electoral timetable. Finally, with regard to the decisions taken this morning by your college relating to what is known as the ‘employment package’, I wonder about the consequences for your neighbour, Mr Rehn, with regard to the austerity policies being put forward in his portfolio. I already know what the response will be: ‘first austerity, then jobs’. I am led to believe this is not the solution and that what we are seeing today in Greece or Spain tells us that another way must be possible, one based on a pact for growth, responsibility and governance. Therefore, Mr Barroso, can you assure us that you are combining your two pillars, your employment pillar and your economic pillar, in the service of European citizens and job creation?

 Mr President, as Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I and Mr De Castro, who chairs the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, wished to raise this topic again here in plenary, partly in the light of the initial declarations made on behalf of the whole College of Commissioners on 15 February, in which it was stated that the Commission intended to use its exclusive right of initiative to bring a proposal back to the negotiating table whereby this programme could be funded under the next financial framework. As you know, you will have Parliament’s full support for such an initiative; however, we are asking you to go further. We feel that this programme must not be held ransom to intergovernmental talks on the common agricultural policy, nor should we subject it too literally to European Court of Justice judgments without reclaiming the legislative initiative. We are therefore calling for this programme to be a genuine solidarity programme; in other words, it should not be a burden on the European Social Fund. Otherwise, as I have already said, we will be using the poor to organise solidarity for the poor. That is not what we need. Lastly Commissioner, I would like to draw your attention to another matter: many people in this Parliament do not support macro-economic conditionality – you will never have our support for that – but do support subject-related conditionality and concentration on specific subjects. One of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy is to combat poverty and social exclusion. This provides all the legitimate basis we need for funding aid to the most deprived out of the EU budget. We ask you to strive for this, and to try to bring on board the Member States that are dismissing this call. Instead of counting them on a list, why not persuade them, and use your exclusive right of initiative as a means of prodding them along? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Vice-President, may I ask you to deliver a message to our President, to thank him and congratulate him on his action at the European Council? I believe that he had a significant impact on the debates by posing the question that is key for European identity: both that of the European social model and that of the democratic legitimacy of the processes embarked upon. This European Council has seen the signing of a treaty when even a government that is one of the most fervent advocates of a ‘Merkozy’ strategy now finds itself in difficulty. In my view, neither Spain nor the Netherlands could reasonably apply this treaty. I have understood, though, that in parallel, suddenly, our leaders have apparently discovered that they must also talk of growth, but not in the same way, not with the same golden rules, but with soft rules. I must say to you that there will be no more growth if you only apply the rule of the internal market, which is just a rule of negative integration, whereas your conclusions turn their back on the balance that had been enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy. You are unravelling this strategy and rewriting it after less than two years. The destruction of the European social model will not bring about more growth. There will not be more growth while those who claim they want to protect it are undermining the foundations of European identity. There will be more growth if you think, first and foremost, about jobs, joint industrial strategies, a European energy community and specific combating of tax evasion, instead of waiting countless months before negotiating and denouncing the unilateral strategies of some Member States. There will be no growth without consistent commitments by the Member States when we negotiate the financial framework and the introduction of an own resource on the basis of Eurobonds and a tax on financial transactions.

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, I address this question to you because Parliament does not understand what is happening at the Council. In December, we adopted by a very large majority the Commission’s proposal to extend European Globalisation Adjustment Fund crisis measures. Now we see it has been completely blocked at the Council in an inconsistent move that we do not understand – for can we declare the crisis over? Can we really say that this fund has not been a useful reflection of the effects of this crisis on workers? Today, growth forecasts for European GDP are between 0.5% and 3%. Or is Mr Draghi mistaken when he cites these figures for future European growth? The Commission itself predicted an economic downturn of 0.3% across the European Union in its latest projections published in February, despite the fact that in November 2011, it was still expecting 0.5% growth in 2012. Where will the crisis end? The crisis facing those employed in industry threatens the very existence of European sentiment. It encourages scepticism towards the European Union. It causes us to turn our backs on the very essence of our peaceful coexistence and ignores the elements of social justice we could provide. Applications submitted under crisis-related criteria have only increased since this crisis has not gone away. I must tell you Mr President that within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we have had the opportunity to hear from Spanish and Lithuanian experts who told us how valuable this crisis mechanism was. Furthermore, I wish to bear witness here to the response of the German public authorities. The director of the European Social Fund group has testified to the exemplary nature of this mechanism in bringing about social innovation and enabling workers affected by this crisis to find a European answer to their problems. However, today, his government constitutes a majority in favour of blocking the extension of this mechanism. We do not understand this and ask you, on behalf of the Presidency of the European Union, to use all your power to break this deadlock. I believe those who consistently argue for more flexicurity. Flexibility certainly exists, with widespread redundancies – day after day, we see jobs disappearing. Provide a little bit of security, allow these workers to be given training, a transitional period as they adapt to the new situation they find themselves in. I am worried that if this is the position of the Council today on the extension of the crisis mechanism, what will happen tomorrow when, as part of the financial perspectives, we are to negotiate the extension of mechanisms to all farmers affected by free trade agreements? There comes a time when the Council must choose between real solidarity and fake solidarity. Today, we prefer evidence and we do not believe the time has come for happy announcements of growth that might one day lead to job creation, or for the abolition of one of the few tools at the European Union’s disposal to provide concrete help, support and solidarity to workers affected not only by globalisation but, above all, by the financial crisis. We are counting on you, Mr President. You must change the majority in the Council, including among those Member States that are today refusing this extension of the derogation, despite being exemplary users of these funds.

 Mr President, Ms Vestager, Commissioner, this is the fifth year running that the Spring European Council is to be held in an atmosphere of crisis. This is the fifth European Council held in an atmosphere of crisis and where, clearly, the logic is that out of austerity will come growth. I think that it is clearly time to take stock and admit that what comes out of austerity is recession and not growth. However, we have come together today to talk of a document that the Commission is adding to the work of the European Council, which goes by the name of the Annual Growth Survey. You must admit that there is something not quite right here and that it is high time to change our approach. First of all, in the name of our institution, the European Parliament, let me just say that we in this House are in total denial of democracy, because what is going on? The Spring European Council is adopting guidelines which are then going to be imposed on the Member States to define their economic policy strategy. On what basis is the Spring European Council going to reach its decisions? The Commission is trying to make its contribution in a direction that does not suit us, and yet it is tabling a Community document entitled Annual Growth Survey. Meanwhile, the Council is going to draw up the Euro Plus Pact on the basis of a scribbled note written by Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy, and then endorsed by the other institutions. In a democracy, the way in which broad economic policy guidelines are drawn up is the foundation of the social pact. That is why we have been fighting for this Parliament to have a say in the matter. We intend to do this on the basis of what the Commission persists in calling an Annual Growth Survey – we are calling for this to become annual guidelines for growth. We are calling on the Commission to face up to reality. Will this Annual Growth Survey enable the potential contradictions between the Stability Pact and the Europe 2020 strategy to be ironed out? Both Mr Gauzès’ and Ms Cornelissen’s reports – I should like to thank our two fellow Members for the spirit of cooperation that has marked our work – invite you to walk on two feet and, if you want to walk on two feet, you may at times have to turn your back on austerity and the Stability Pact. Otherwise, we shall never manage to implement the Europe 2020 strategy. We are also calling for a balanced approach to economic situations. That means that, when there are imbalances within the European Union, you have to look at both deficits and surpluses. Ms Vestager, as I have already said, for us, the Euro Plus Pact is not a basis for negotiation. Madam, just look at the figures. Today, everybody in Europe is in difficulties. Have you seen the OECD’s figures for Germany’s growth prospects for 2012? 0.4%. That is proof enough that even the most virtuous economy in the European Union cannot withstand the situation of recession into which the policies of this five-year term are leading the euro area and the European Union as a whole. Furthermore, look at the way that you are managing the EU’s tools. The European Social Fund is being used for anything and everything. On the one hand, you would like it to be a tool to apply macro-economic sanctions and, on the other, when it comes to creating jobs for young people, you want to mobilise the European Social Fund. These contradictions must be resolved and, to do this, I suggest you look at the reports that this Assembly is offering you as the European Parliament’s contribution to the work of the Spring Council. I hope that, via our President when he comes to talk to you, these guidelines, whether in economic or employment matters, will improve your road map because, if they do not, democracy and the European people will find themselves in a jam. Pervenche Berès,  
rapporteur.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, you said that the European Parliament had agreed not to change the guidelines. So be it. However, we would like to see these guidelines implemented and, in our reports, we make a certain number of proposals to provide you with the means to monitor this implementation. In particular, I should like to mention one proposal, the proposal to work with the Member States on a budgetary heading which would allow us to ascertain the contribution of the Member States, for example, to realising the objectives of the 2020 strategy rather than towards military expenditure or whatever else. Ms Vestager, thank you for being here today. You have said that you will report on this debate and the work of this Parliament at the 21 February meeting of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN). This is precisely what we would like to see. It is in that spirit that we would like to advance European democracy and it is also in that spirit that on 27 and 28 February, we shall meet with representatives of all the national parliaments to ensure that, in this European Semester, there is also room for the democratic dimension to thrive. Finally, Ms Vestager, may I call on you to take into account in the same way, during this ECOFIN Council, the new impact assessment that the Commission is due to publish tomorrow on the assessment of the tax on financial transactions.

Mr President, we are going to vote on Mr Siekierski’s report. On behalf of all our fellow Members and, in particular, the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we would like to say that we are going to accept the two-year extension of the Food Distribution Programme for the Most Deprived Persons, on the basis of the agreement reached at the Council. Simply speaking, bearing in mind the political conditions under which this agreement was reached at the Council, we would like to obtain a statement from the Commission on its vision for the future of this programme. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 – (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, we must not forget, all the same, that this proposal goes against the adoption of a so-called ‘golden’ rule. This is good because this new treaty does not include a single provision in favour of growth and employment while, on the other hand, you have this declaration, which you have today been charged with putting in place. When you are looking for good ideas to encourage youth employment, I would invite you to turn your attention to Parliament’s work, since we have drafted a report on youth employment in which I think you will find some good proposals. As for the use of the Structural Funds, we are still being bombarded with contradictions which are sparking debate. On the one hand, we want to mobilise Structural Funds to offset the golden rule but, aside from that, we want to use them to sanction the Member States. The time will come when we will have to choose where our consistency lies. How can the European Union work when it is being pulled in two directions? Then, when we are discussing fundamental financial perspectives, President Barroso’s movement questions us. Does the European Union’s budget not need to have resources at its disposal that can be used, depending on the situation, to implement countercyclical measures? In this case, are the proposals you have made for the future Structural Funds programmes adapted to the crisis situation the EU is currently experiencing? Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, I would like to ask Mr Fernandes if he regards being concerned about the consequences of pension reform which excludes workers from the entire compensation and income system as getting involved in politics – clearly, coming from his mouth, this seems to be a bad thing. Mr Gauzès, who, to my knowledge, belongs to the same group, took the view that it had to be taken into account and that the government as shareholder should perhaps be concerned about this situation. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, the European Parliament, with a very large majority, pronounced itself in favour of extending the crisis mechanism within the framework of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). It is something of a paradox that some Member States – whose representative and member of the Council is not present to hear this debate and our arguments – refuse to extend the derogation within the framework of the crisis mechanism at a time when the OECD notes that the European Union and, in particular, the euro area is in recession, and has corrected the growth forecasts for next year to 0.2%. Where is the end of the crisis? I put the question to the Council. The reality is that there is a blocking minority in the Council which thinks that, since we are in a crisis, it is no longer necessary to apply the fundamental rule of the European Union, which is that of solidarity. I call on the Council to hear Parliament’s message. We demand solidarity within the European Union. Madam President, I would like just one second to talk about Renault. There are some in this Chamber who say that this is all about electoral manoeuvring. I call on the Commission to assume its responsibilities and to ensure that its right hand knows what its left hand is doing. I ask that, tomorrow, when it looks at how pension reform has been implemented in France, it takes into account the damage caused by Mr Bertrand and his pension reform and that it tells France that the disastrous effects of this pension reform must be corrected.

 Mr President, in tackling this report, Parliament is tackling the issue of democratic legitimacy in the context of economic policy. At a time when everyone is wondering about how economic policy will be handled and about the fate that the forthcoming Council meeting has in store for that policy for the member countries of the euro area, it is important for the European Parliament to express its opinion in order to establish what the democratic legitimacy of the debate on an economic policy coordinated at EU level might consist of. The European Commission has put forward the idea of a European semester in order to give direction to this debate before it takes place in the national parliaments. We believe that, as part of this European semester, we, the European Parliament, must be able to have our say with regard to the Annual Growth Survey that the European Commission is tabling as a key document for this debate. We believe that this document should be an economic policy-making document, which is why we are proposing that, in future, the Commission describe this document as what it is: not an annual growth survey, but an economic policy-making document aimed at sustainable growth. Because, otherwise, it is clear that economic policy coordination at Heads of State or Government level will go in an altogether different direction, that of a Euro Plus Pact, for example, or of who knows what other procedure they might invent in the future. No, we need a document from the Commission that gives direction to this debate, that incorporates the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and, of course, those of the Stability and Growth Pact. To ensure this, we also call for the European Parliament to be able to intervene straight away with quasi-codecision powers before the Spring European Council, and for the President of this institution, when he represents us at that Council, to be able to defend changes to this strategy, to this economic policy stance, on the basis of the mandate we shall give him. We also call for these powers to be recognised explicitly ascodecision powers in the future. Throughout this process, we believe that our cooperation with the national parliaments really must help to create this democratic legitimacy. This means that in February, before the Spring European Council, we must organise this meeting with the national parliaments in order to discuss what this economic policy stance will consist of. We must do so on the basis of what has already taken place and what is set to take place within this Parliament not only on the initiative of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, but also in cooperation with other committees, such as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. Then, once the European Council is over, we must organise a further debate, perhaps on a smaller scale, when the national parliaments themselves will have to ratify their national reform programmes. Lastly, we believe that this Parliament will clearly have to adapt to this new situation if it wants to be involved in this debate to establish the democratic legitimacy of the entire process. To ensure this, we know that we will have to adapt our ways of working, our practices to what is currently being implemented by both the Council and the Commission, and we state in this report that we are ready to do so. Lastly, with regard to the still uncertain prospect of a possible Treaty reform, we would make the following strong point: under the Treaty of Lisbon, this Parliament has rights that make it a key player in any Treaty reform process. We have already been consulted once on the reform of the Treaty when the European Stability Mechanism was implemented, and at that time we authorised this reform without an agreement. Given the issues that could potentially be discussed, we confirm today that we shall not allow such a reform to take place without an agreement. Discussions will have to be held with Parliament on both the time frame and the content of such a reform. It cannot simply be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union, so that economic policy is turned into a form of competition policy. We want this mandate to be a mandate for laying the foundations of EU economic policy, a solidarity and growth policy that is based on democratic legitimacy. As for the issue of how to achieve this, we also call for this Parliament to be involved, alongside the national parliaments, by means of an agreement. Democratic legitimacy is what gives the European Union added value. Pervenche Berès,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should first like to respond to Ms Ford, who has abandoned us. It is surprising to see an MEP from the United Kingdom express concern about the fact that a parliament is worried about democratic legitimacy. That does not match the impression I have of democracy as seen from the United Kingdom. I also wish to say to her that we are so insistent that the European Parliament should have the power of codecision when defining its economic policy guidelines precisely because we believe that, budgetary consolidation aside, this is one of the ways of ensuring that our concerns with regard to growth and with regard to funding for innovation, research and investment needs in industry are taken into account. President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to thank you for your insistence on the Community method, and to say to you that, while the Member States are, of course, sovereign powers, it is important that we also learn the lessons of this crisis. One of the lessons of this crisis is that ex-ante coordination of Member States’ economic policies has not worked well enough. To ensure that it does work well, and on an acceptable, democratic basis, in accordance with what the European institution stands for, I invite you, and your successors, on behalf of the Danish Presidency, to take full account of the observations that this Parliament will make on the 2012 Annual Growth Survey. Commissioner, you said that you did not want this exercise to be described as technocratic. It is up to us alone to make it a political economic-policy making exercise. I believe that this report contributes to this aim and I hope, Commissioner, that you will support us in improving the procedure and in ensuring that the Council genuinely takes account of the observations that this European Parliament will make. We shall come to the February part-session with observations on the content so that, together, we are more effective. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Vice-President Rehn, I think that you heard Mr Juncker when he talked about how the European semester should become a political tool. To that end, the founding act of the discussion – which is at least what we think you called the Annual Growth Survey – must become annual guidelines for sustainable growth. You have the chance, this time, to change it before next time, so do it. If this European semester is to be a debate about political guidelines, there will then be no economic government without Parliament involved, having its say, creating discussion around these political and economic guidelines. You must realise that, in 2012, this European Parliament might propose amendments to this Annual Growth Review, which would be debated at the European Council. That is what this Parliament is proposing. I hope that you can take it into account, because then you will be keeping democracy and political debate alive and national parliaments and the European Parliament will be involved in what must be genuine governance of the euro area and of the Union. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Daerden, for his excellent work. Commissioner, you fought and managed to get the objective of combating poverty included in the Europe 2020 strategy. Our current fear is that, with austerity plans, this essential objective may be overlooked. The conclusion of the agreement on the European food aid programme has left a nasty taste in my mouth as I fear that France and Germany have signed up to abandoning it definitively after 2014. That is not the thrust of the Europe 2020 strategy. We have a sovereign debt crisis and yet nothing should make us deviate from this strategy, as it is our road map, the one that we set for ourselves. In the fight against poverty, we must, in the platform that you have introduced, work on more precise indicators, as we still lack the ability to intervene in a targeted fashion with quantified objectives. This would allow us to benefit from intervention from the European Social Fund, in particular, targeted precisely at real trends in poverty. Then we would like the issue of minimum income to be raised clearly. We are calling for a consultation by the European Commission on a legal proposal of this nature. That, Commissioner, is your responsibility. We are also calling for the issue of accessibility to social services of general interest to be maintained. Finally, we are calling for the horizontal Anti-discrimination Directive to see the light of day. This is also crucial if this platform for combating poverty and social exclusion is to be a success. Pervenche Berès,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

 Mr President, we welcome the fact that the Commission’s draft budget has been restored in the areas that concern the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. The Commissioner was good enough to welcome this, and we feel this is important overall. This is the first budget since 14 January 2011, and hence the first since the Arab democratic revolution began. We welcome and back the European Training Foundation’s initiative to secure EU budget funding to help support industrial relations and the development of the labour market, in the context of the dialogue we will be entering into with these southern Mediterranean partner countries. Unfortunately, this is not the first budget of this economic crisis we are going through. We therefore feel that all initiatives that can be undertaken to support youth employment, especially through the pilot project we have begun, and the ‘Your first EURES job’ project for young people, are absolutely vital; and we hope that when the budget conciliation takes place, the budget for this project will be kept at the figure we voted for. Pervenche Berès,  
author.

 Madam President, Mr Dominik, Commissioner, Parliament’s intention in tabling this oral question was to contribute to a debate that we feel is absolutely crucial. When the Commission took the initiative to present this European Semester proposal, the idea was that economic governance should include a period of time for establishing European guidelines. This is, to some extent, a step towards the creation of this infamous economic government. We, the European Parliament, are worried about the fact that there might be an economic government without an economic ‘parliament’. We would like to hear your assessment of the democratic legitimacy of this European Semester. How does democratic debate on this European Semester fit in? Political debate on economic policy guidelines is the foundation of every democracy. If you raise the level at which economic policy guidelines are decided, then you must pay heed to the democratic debate and deliberation on those guidelines. That is what the European Parliament is trying to ensure and what we are challenging you on. I note that, during the European Council on Sunday, you brought up the European Semester and you managed to do so without once mentioning the European Parliament, or even, I have to say, the national parliaments. Do you think that that is acceptable? Similarly, the Commission pledged to present its next Annual Growth Survey in December. Very well. So be it. Why, then, have you not discussed it with us? Where is the democratic debate on this issue? When you table your new proposal, which assessment of the cycle that has just ended will you base it on? How are you incorporating the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives in your analysis of this European Semester? Furthermore, as Ms Bowles said – and I fully support her on this and on many other points in this matter – we are asking you to be completely transparent with regard to the amendments that you make to the country-specific recommendations after discussing them with the Member States. Otherwise, this exercise has no legitimacy and is meaningless. When you adopt the Annual Growth Survey, how much importance do you really attach to that document? Is it just a bureaucratic document to keep the European Parliament happy, or is it a genuine policy document? Unless we are mistaken, and your real objective is the Euro Plus Pact. We want some explanations on this point, Commissioner. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, with this report – and I should like to congratulate our rapporteur, Ms Bastos – we wanted to initiate dialogue with the European Commission. Your colleague, Ms Damanaki, reiterated on your behalf the proposals that you are making regarding the use of the European Social Fund (ESF), to ensure that 25% is dedicated to training and to the use of the ESF in every project. However, we are concerned about the idea that, at this time of crisis, which we have been debating all day long, we might penalise countries that are finding it difficult to meet the Stability and Growth Pact criteria by reducing the structural funds, particularly the European Social Fund. Europe will not have the means to rise to the challenge it faces, namely, overcoming the crisis and implementing the Europe 2020 strategy – for which the objectives of job creation and combating social exclusion are absolutely paramount – in this way. If we wish to successfully rise to this challenge, the issue of training, as Ms Bastos has suggested to us, is vital. That being the case, we also need to ensure that the creation of new types of jobs does not make us lose sight of one of the pillars of European democracy, namely, the functioning of social dialogue. We do not believe that it is necessary to depart from this idea of collective agreements, which have ensured the success of social democracy in Europe. Moreover, through your colleague, Commissioner, you also pointed out that the European Job Mobility Portal, EURES, is a precious asset when it comes to the free movement of persons throughout Europe. I believe that together, we need to take a fresh look at this matter so as to ensure the effective operation of this tool. I have heard it said, here and there, that we might be able to improve its functioning, and I would like it if we could work towards this together with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR)
 Madam President, Commissioner, like many who have spoken before me, I think that Ms Rühle’s report is a good one. Public procurement is an instrument with which public authorities can set an example. Consequently, this idea that the criterion of the most economically advantageous offer should replace that of the lowest price is somewhat in line with our demand at European level for the criterion of GNP no longer to be the only indicator. We are on the right track. However, if you are looking for ways of going further, you could also take the step of proposing bonuses and penalties for companies that fail to meet the requirements in terms of sustainable and quality goods and services when implementing these public procurement contracts. Furthermore, as you and many others have said, we want to be able to facilitate access for operators in the social economy through this review of public procurement rules at EU level. I should like to raise a third point, which I believe is absolutely crucial, namely, the issue of subcontracting. As you know, Commissioner, large worksites throughout the world are a real disgrace in terms of their compliance with social legislation. We cannot bury our heads in the sand and use competition or the risk of the Chinese winning contracts as an excuse. We need to make these contracts an example of excellence in social terms. This means that you have to review the chain of responsibility issue. Tenderers who win public contracts must shoulder their responsibilities, and that includes going and supervising letterbox companies that encourage modern-day slavery and which we cannot tolerate within the European Union. Pervenche Berès  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, Commissioner, you are going to make new proposals on economic governance in competition with, or head-to-head with, the President of the European Council. At least this contribution has added value, though. Economic governance will not improve without democratic oversight, without democratic legitimacy. Do not forget that, at EU level, what goes on in the Council must be overseen by this House and that the ordinary legislative procedure ought perhaps to be considered within the scope of the European Semester. Moving on, I should like, if I may, to put some questions to you as the representative of your President, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso. Mr Barroso came here to deliver a speech to us on the State of the Union, which he hailed as probably one of his greatest speeches. Then, three days later, having denounced the role of the G20, he accepted instructions from a capital to apply macro-economic conditionality to the Structural Funds. Put simply, the regions, the poor and workers are being made to pay for what the capitals have been unable to implement. Do you consider that to be an example of good European governance? On 21 July, when you and the Heads of State or Government adopted the second bailout plan for Greece, you said that we needed a pillar to support economic activity, and you used the Structural Funds for that purpose. Why is it, then, that what was legitimate on 21 July has become an absurdity in your proposal on the Structural Funds? That is not good governance.  (Applause) Stéphane Le Foll  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner, we have all gathered this morning to express our anger. There may be legal reasons for the decision that has been taken, but it makes no political sense. Indeed, it is politically indefensible, in the current crisis and under the current conditions, to reduce the food aid budget as you are proposing to do – aid that goes to our most deprived citizens. You cannot leave it there. You cannot. All the political groups in Parliament are calling on you to make the right decisions. We are not talking about EUR 500 million as opposed to EUR 100 million. We are talking about at least maintaining existing levels of food aid. Demand is growing in every country. Let me say a few words on the subject of agriculture. Once again, my comments are directed at the Commission. The question of agricultural stocks is not the same as it was 10, 15 or 20 years ago, when intervention stocks left us with huge surpluses. In the current European situation, we need a policy on food security stocks, both for Europe and for the rest of the world. I say this in the light of starvation levels around the world and the current situation in Europe. These are two very clear signals. You must reinstate a decent budget that will allow us to address this problem. In terms of agricultural policy, the Commission now needs to put forward clear proposals that will allow the creation of what we are calling food security stocks. The reality is that access to food is a major problem at the dawn of the 21st century, both in Europe and in the rest of the world. This morning, this House is sending you a very clear message. I hope that you are up to this massive challenge. Stéphane Le Foll,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Dess, Mr Dantin was cut off, but he was going to explain that the global food challenge is important, and it is important. As has already been said, this report, together with previous reports and the Commission’s communication, seeks to demonstrate that Europe’s aim is to have a common agricultural policy that guarantees food security in Europe and contributes to global food security. That entails political commitments on market regulation, which is what is under discussion today. We too will have to push for this in our debates at EU level. At a time when there are plans to eliminate Europe’s food security programme, we need to remember that food security is still a matter of solidarity and is still extremely topical in Europe: almost 30 million Europeans are currently suffering from malnutrition. Let us not lose sight of that fact. Essentially, this report sets out the broad thrust: the greening of agricultural policy. Of course farming needs to take a positive approach to environmental issues. In particular, it needs to focus on the European element and ensure that it is factored in by incorporating environmental issues into the first pillar. Another important point is that this compromise is the result of lengthy negotiations, in which I have always been involved, on the question of graduated support. At long last, support will be allocated in accordance with two criteria: employment – I believe that agricultural policy needs to allow for the notion of providing employment – and, of course, the production of public goods. This approach is better than continuing the debate on aid ceilings and never coming up with any solutions. I am making the point this afternoon because it is my honest opinion. Let me conclude by saying that this report and Parliament’s commitment are pointless unless the agriculture budget remains at its current level. That is my response to the comments made by the Commissioner and the President of the Commission on the second pillar. We cannot accept a budget cut. Stéphane Le Foll,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I fully agree with the remark that Mairead McGuinness has just made on the fact that there is a fundamental link between the issues of food and agriculture. The issue we are addressing is rising food prices and the consequences that may have for a certain number of populations around the globe, as well as in Europe. I would first like to make the following observation. The trend towards ever higher agricultural and commodities prices is, in my view, a long-term trend, which will continue for three main reasons: first, world demographic trends and a rising world population; second, the fact that, with global warming, we are experiencing problematic weather hazards such as drought and floods; third, because the world is also developing. With new emerging economies consumption levels are increasing. Therefore, the tight situation on agricultural markets and agricultural commodities is a trend that is on the increase. It is aggravated by price volatility, and price volatility is a consequence of the financialisation of the global economy. This is what we should be addressing if we want to resolve the agricultural issue and the food issue. To do this – what the Commissioner said is important – there are two elements: yes, there needs to be transparency on stocks, but we also need a public policy on stocks in Europe and stock management at a global level, especially at the level of the United Nations. Secondly, regulation of the financial markets and market speculation is essential, in particular by ensuring that there is no longer any connection between the speculative volume and the physical quantities exchanged on the markets. As regards food, it is unacceptable that speculators speculate without taking account of the consequences this may have for world food and humanity. This leads me to draw two major conclusions. Firstly, we need a strong European policy and to strategically reassert Europe’s commitment to being a global player in the food and agricultural sectors. Secondly, we need to change our development policy to ensure that globally – and Europe is a global player – we once again invest in agriculture, because we need agriculture to feed the world. (Applause) Stéphane Le Foll,  
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

Madam President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, I should like to speak without going back over the debate we have had up to now. We debated a 2011 budget under the constraints with which we are familiar, that is, those of a deep crisis affecting all of Europe with public deficits at national level which could lead to two hypotheses. Either these public deficits at national level pose a constraint on the European deficit, or these deficits at national level must give a new direction and a new lease of life at the level of Europe. That is the question. I am asking you, Commissioner, to try, above all, when we debate the budgetary review, when we are about to start to talk about the budgetary perspectives for post-2013, not to remain completely absorbed by this context of crisis, unless you are going to tell me and tell all European citizens that, in effect, Europe will remain in the crisis for a long time. Our entire problem really concerns how to manage the crisis and reduce our deficits and debt, and also how to prepare for extricating ourselves from the crisis. That is where the question of the budget comes in. We can only get out of the crisis, and Joseph Daul made this point just now, if the European budget, on account of being European, is able to provide us with the resources to recover what we are lacking today; that is growth, job creation, innovation, research. That is what is at stake and it is in these terms that we should debate the budget and not do what we are too often prone to do, that is, constantly harp on about the issue of the crisis and the issue of deficits, and the Council really excels at that. I observed that at Deauville, the German Chancellor and the French President even announced in anticipation a reform of the treaties, without having had any kind of discussion with Mr Van Rompuy, so as to punish all those States which failed to respect budgetary discipline in the future. That is where we have got to in the Council today, while Parliament is only asking for one thing, in particular of the Commission, and that is to try to move the European project forward, which happens through the budget. So, you have noted a certain number of issues on which we are entirely in agreement. There is a need for greater flexibility. Evidently, we must manage together to find the capacity to have a much more flexible budget because it is a necessity; Europe’s capacity for reaction is at stake. It is also, of course, a question of setting priorities and organising the European budget efficiently. We are all doubtless in agreement that it is a necessity. However, where we must be clear with one another is on the need for a timetable, on the need for us to set our objectives together. Commissioner, we cannot leave matters as empty words and promises, written texts which are extremely interesting and with which I agree almost 100%. Now we are going to have to get down to the practical matters and, in particular, to an essential issue that we have been skirting round, that of own resources. What do we need to do in order to have own resources tomorrow for Europe, or rather for all the citizens of Europe, so that we are all put back on the path to growth and on an even firmer path for the Europe of tomorrow to take? We await your ambitious proposals, Commissioner. Stéphane Le Foll  (S&amp;D
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, I too would like to welcome the work done by the rapporteur, Mr Bové, to welcome the Commissioner, and also to welcome the speech by Mr Dess, who spoke before me, on the objectives of this report. I feel it is very important to remember that, in this debate, we have to solve a problem linked to the volatility of agricultural prices and, above all, to the fact that, when prices rise, the increase is very quickly passed on to the distribution sector, but when they fall at production level, there is no knock-on effect for consumers. Therefore, there is clearly a problem with the way in which the chain is organised; there is clearly a problem with the way in which so-called added value is distributed within it. I believe that Mr Bové’s report offers ideas, in several areas, that we must take further – and here I am really addressing the Commission – in order to try and emerge from this fundamentally negative spiral. The first, of course, is to organise the chain and the balance of power within it. What proposals are we making to ensure that producers who work together and are organised carry more weight within the chain in order to negotiate? That is the question you asked, Commissioner, with regard to interprofessions, but it is also a question that relates to the contractual basis that is going to be implemented. I call for this contractual basis to have a European framework – a point made in the report. We cannot let each country solve this problem. There has to be a European framework. It must be flexible, but it must exist. This proposal, this course of action, is inextricably linked as far as I am concerned. Secondly, of course, there is the issue of price transparency. Here, I am in favour of creating this observatory, which we absolutely must have so that consumers can be kept informed of price trends. Those are the points I wished to make. I support the proposals that have been made and I hope, as Mr Dess said, that the rapporteur’s proposals receive the support of the majority. Stéphane Le Foll  (S&amp;D

 – (FR) 
Mr President, I understand that you had a short and happy night. I thank the Commissioner for listening throughout this debate and I would like to congratulate Mr Lyon on the work he has carried out in connection with the report he is presenting this morning. What is the aim here? To make people realise that, in today’s world, agriculture, food and the environment are challenges for the whole of Europe. That is the aim. What do we mean by that? Rejecting the renationalisation of the CAP and increasing cofinancing, that is the first point. Maintaining an agricultural budget that is a match for these challenges and this major issue of food security, that is the second point. Ensuring that agriculture can provide the public goods demanded by society, that is the third element. The fourth element is regulating and preventing market volatility, which I believe is essential. We must return to this topic and we need to go a little further still. My final point concerns the first and the second pillar. I warn all those who defend this structure – and they are perhaps right – that, ultimately, within the framework of the budgetary discussion, there is a danger of the first pillar being reduced significantly, with everything being transferred to the second pillar, itself cofinanced, which would contradict the objective we have set of avoiding the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy. I am saying that this morning because this is the debate we are holding. Commissioner, I would like to finish with a simple idea. The CAP was created at the same time as the European Economic Community. We are now in the European Union. I really feel that we ought to have a major policy … (The President cut off the speaker) Stéphane Le Foll,

 Mr President, it therefore falls to us to close these debates this evening, and it is already late. I would like, first of all, to excuse the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr De Castro, who is unable to be here with us this evening for reasons that you know. Like other Members of this House, he has been unable to leave his country to come and participate in our debates in Strasbourg. The issue with which we are concerned results from the general crisis being experienced by the entire agricultural sector. As we know today, we are experiencing a crisis and, above all, seeing a fall in prices and agricultural revenues that is affecting cereal producers, livestock producers, whether pork or beef producers, and also – and I say this on behalf of Mr De Castro – olive oil producers, and which is hitting and has hit dairy producers extremely hard. Faced with this crisis and this price fall, it goes without saying that Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wishes to find out from the Commission what we can do right now and in the future to escape this crisis and, above all, what measures could be adopted in the coming months to support farmers and to ensure that the agricultural markets are less volatile. The first question that I would like to ask the Commissioner is more specifically about the dairy crisis: what is the situation with regard to the measures adopted by Parliament and the Council concerning this dairy crisis and, in particular, to the application of the famous EUR 300 million milk fund that had been agreed? That is the first question because I think that, if we are going to take legislative decisions, then we must know how they are being applied. As I was saying, all types of production are currently being hit by a price fall and a deep crisis in the markets. That brings us to a question and to seek answers on what we might call market regulation and the way in which we can limit this infamous price volatility. Nobody complains when prices are rising, especially not farmers. It is European consumers who fear agricultural price rises, which limit their purchasing power and impact on their ability to buy agricultural products. It is when prices are low and when they are falling for long periods that producers are penalised in terms of their incomes and, above all, and most seriously for European agriculture, in terms of their abilities to invest and to prepare for the future. Agriculture is a hard industry; the investments are substantial and it takes a long time to obtain a return on those investments. We need to stabilise prices. Commissioner, the question from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its Chair, Mr De Castro, is composed of two points. Firstly, you have announced a number of dairy-related measures to be implemented before the end of the year. This is important. Can you give us some details of these? Secondly, there are specific measures that need to be taken on all the markets, not just dairy. Finally, the question that we wished to ask you is how the Commission plans to anticipate and prevent these price falls in the medium term. What market regulation mechanism can be used to limit sudden increases and, above all, sudden price falls? What work is the Commission currently doing and how does it view this issue? Those are the three elements that I wished to mention: the milk fund, perspectives on the dairy crisis and, more generally, the way in which the Commission intends to deal with this issue of price volatility and price falls. Stéphane Le Foll,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, the report I am presenting to Parliament sets out to explain that the agricultural sector has a place and a role to play in the fight against global warming. This week, nature has reminded us – this time in the shape of volcanoes – that it can have a major impact on human activities and on the climate. However, this means that, in spite of everything, human beings and Europe in particular must take responsibility for combating what we refer to as global warming. My report aims to show that the agricultural sector can continue to reduce both its carbon emissions and its fossil fuel consumption and, above all, at the same time, can make a very active contribution to carbon fixation so that, at world level, we can achieve lower carbon emissions and ensure that a greater proportion of carbon is stored and captured. The report attempts to illustrate the need for agriculture to move away from a compartmentalised approach, which consists of introducing a new directive on soil, water, pesticides and so on, whenever there is a problem, towards trying to tackle the agricultural issue in a more comprehensive and systematic way. Within this type of approach, we will need to identify avenues which ensure, as I mentioned earlier, that the agricultural sector not only reduces its energy consumption but, at the same time, actively participates in carbon fixation. This role relates, in particular, to photosynthesis and biomass, and especially to an area that is close to my heart, which is soil and the capacity of European soils to store organic carbon. I believe that this approach, which I discuss in this report and which I hope will be endorsed during the vote that is due to take place in the Brussels part-session, will enable agriculture in Europe to enter a new phase of sustainability and to make the transition to a more environmentally aware state which would place it ahead of a number of other continents and other agricultural systems. In doing so, it would have a more positive impact both economically and environmentally and, as a result, a more positive impact in social terms. This report deals, therefore, with the specific issue of agriculture in relation to the fight against global warming, but it also claims – in any case I hope it does – to explore other ways of sustaining, in particular, the debate that will be taking place on the future of agricultural policy post-2013. I am addressing the Commission; I will be addressing the agricultural committees, as I have frequently done, and I will also be addressing the various ministers when I have the opportunity. I believe we need to change direction. The 2013 CAP needs to be ambitious. It must be based on goals that will help citizens to understand why we need a common agricultural policy. We need a common agricultural policy because Europe’s agricultural community needs both to ensure food security and to embark on the path of sustainability. In any case, this is the direction I propose in my report and the one in which I hope a large majority of Parliament will follow me. Stéphane Le Foll  (S&amp;D

Madam President, President Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, I would like first of all to say that, as far as the 2020 strategy is concerned, everyone agrees on the targets. However, the problem our continent has today is that it is emerging from a serious crisis, the characteristics of that being that we have extremely weak, or even negative, growth globally. This therefore requires political awareness and, for me, that has two goals. Firstly, that of knowing how we organise ourselves politically. In the positions you hold, you have two major responsibilities: to encourage coordination of economic policies – this is absolutely vital – and to set targets with tools to achieve them. This brings me on to the second goal, which I believe is essential, and, at the same time, it will be a question. To achieve goals in public policy, a budget is needed. Today, Europe is confronted with this dilemma: the Member States have significant deficits and the more significant their deficits, the less they will throw in Europe’s common pot. Therefore, we are less able to revive our growth. How do we solve this dilemma? This is the question I put to you. It depends on two elements. Firstly, what are the guidelines that you will defend when discussing the budgetary perspectives with the Member States? Secondly, are you able to move towards innovations that will allow the European Investment Bank and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development alike to assume much greater responsibility and – why not? – to enable Europe to borrow to finance this necessity, which is the growth of tomorrow?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall certainly repeat things which have already been said and welcome, in any case, the result of the Irish vote on the Treaty of Lisbon. I should simply like to draw the attention of the Members remaining in the House to the reasons for the change, because we are satisfied with the ‘yes’ but, a year ago, it was a ‘no’. What has changed? The text? Very little. The context? A lot. That is what matters. We can discuss institutional questions here. What the citizens are waiting for are political answers from Europe. That, to my mind, is the analysis that we need to make of this double vote. There is not just one vote, there are two. The ‘no’ to start with and then the ‘yes’. The Irish said that they needed Europe in the crisis and this needs to be heavily emphasised, because they are asking Europe to protect them and that is important. I shall repeat what numerous members have said. I think that we need to proceed quickly now. So we are turning to the Swedish Presidency of the Council and we are turning to the Commission. If we want to reply to the demand by the people of Ireland, we need to give concrete replies. The economic crisis: is Europe capable of stimulating growth on a European scale? The social crisis: is Europe capable of having an employment policy? For me, these are the subjects at the heart of the debate and I am satisfied with another thing which the Treaty of Lisbon gives us and that is that Parliament will have enhanced powers and, in the political debate, I think that it has an essential role to play and that is to show that there are various options and to debate those options. However, now, if this is to be a democratic debate and if Europe is to manage to provide replies, we quickly need to designate a Commission and to ensure that the Czechs ratify as quickly as possible so that Europe can get back on the road to growth and hope.

Madam President, Commissioner, I will be brief. I think that there are two parts to this debate. There is the immediate question of how we can extricate ourselves from this crisis. All measures, ranging from assistance for farmers to intervention measures, are necessary – in fact, absolutely necessary. We must endorse them and even call for them to be enlarged in scope. That is what we, together with several fellow Members, are proposing here in Parliament. Secondly, there is the structural question regarding the management of the dairy market, and this is where our views diverge from yours, Commissioner. You propose that we move in the direction of using contractual relations. I can tell you in advance that introducing contractual relations between industrial firms and farmers will, in the long term, result in those industries competing with each other, on a Europe-wide scale. In order to regulate a market, we need public regulation. There is no other solution. After this crisis, that is what the debate must be about. I think that, in this debate, we must respect all opinions and all options; I fear that we acted too quickly at the time of the health check to settle an issue such as quotas, which up until now, as I would like to point out to all those who have spoken, have made it possible to maintain dairy production in Europe, to ensure that the dairy industry is highly developed and, at the same time, to keep prices at a level that was easily affordable for customers.

 The objectives pursued by this regional convention: to replace more than 100 bilateral protocols with a single protocol; to integrate the countries of the Western Balkans into the pan-Euro-Mediterranean system of rules of origin; and to facilitate trade between the member countries, are contributing to the economic integration of the Euro-Mediterranean region, which has been a major objective of the EU’s Euro-Mediterranean policy since the Barcelona Process. In addition, its conclusion has been sought for a number of years by our partners in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean. After all the talk that accompanied the Arab revolutions, it is time to take action. The adoption of this convention will enable the EU to send for the first time a clear message of openness to trade to the countries of the southern Mediterranean, which are finally opening up to democracy. However, the convention alone will not suffice to bring about the major changes we are expecting in the EU’s trade relations with the southern Mediterranean. We therefore need to continue our efforts to support the development of South-South trade, to improve customs cooperation, to modernise the rules of origin themselves and, more generally, to review EU trade policy towards our Mediterranean partners, in that it should take more account of their interests.

 Mr President, on behalf of my four colleagues, I should like firstly to extend my warmest thanks to the MEPs who enabled the adoption of this initiative, and secondly to say that the European Parliament, in my view, is sending a very strong message today to our southern partners and, especially, to their young people, and that Parliament now expects the Commission to make proposals promptly so that the Erasmus and Leonardo programmes actually become a reality for these countries.

I voted in favour of the report by my fellow Member, Mrs Balzani, defining the position of Parliament in the forthcoming negotiations on the 2012 budget. Today, the European Parliament has given instructions to those of its Members who will represent it before the Council and the Commission in the budget negotiations starting on 11 July. If there is a message in this vote, it is that the vast majority of us are intent on warning the Council against any attempt to reduce the European budget. We are not of course advocating spending for spending’s sake. We are well aware of the terrible crisis ravaging our continent. However – and the Socialists have been saying this for a long time – Europe will not emerge from this crisis by sacrificing its future and selling tomorrow’s growth on the cheap. We should, rather, have the courage to speak out and not fear confronting populism. We do not need less Europe. We need more Europe. Until we give the Union the resources it needs to fulfil its ambitions, it would be an illusion to believe that it will be able to return to the path our citizens want to go down.

This resolution, which I had a hand in drawing up, comes at a critical moment, and thus a key moment, in the resolution of the conflict in South Sudan. In January, the South Sudanese overwhelmingly voted for their independence in a referendum. In one month, a new state will be born. However, there are still several concerns, especially after the recent incidences of violence in the disputed Abyei region. More than ever, in this pivotal period, Parliament intends to reaffirm its complete support for the peace process and to appeal to the Sudanese and South Sudanese, as well as the international community, to remain committed to implementing the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement. In particular, the European Parliament is calling on the Sudanese and South Sudanese to propose specific plans taking account of sensitive subjects, namely citizenship, the sharing of debt and of oil revenues. These plans will also have to deal with the difficult issue of borders in order to ensure that a peaceful and viable coexistence of the two states can be maintained. Vincent Peillon  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report by Mr Coelho proposing the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the ‘Schengen area’. This is one of the greatest achievements of the European integration process. The accession of a new State is conditional on strict compliance with the criteria of the Schengen Agreement. In the case of Bulgaria and Romania, the European Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties – like the European Commission – has concluded after evaluation that these two States meet the conditions laid down in full. Consequently, there is no longer any reason why they cannot integrate into this area of free movement. I would find it unacceptable if certain States, under false pretexts and motivated by internal political calculation, continued to oppose it. The Community acquis should not be regarded as an à la carte
 system where Member States can adapt or suspend provisions as circumstances dictate. Therefore, I solemnly call upon the Council to acknowledge the improvements made by Bulgaria and Romania and admit them into the Schengen area. Vincent Peillon  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the Audy report on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme on research and development. With this text, the European Parliament confirms its support for this programme, which is of vital importance for developing European research and improving the competitiveness of our businesses. It defends the establishment of a permanent budget, which is essential if it is going to be able to meet its targets. This report then sets out specific proposals with the aim of resolving the programme’s weaknesses. It rightly highlights the need to simplify funding procedures and optimise existing instruments, so as to facilitate access for small and medium-sized enterprises. Finally, this report reminds us that the European Commission needs to ensure that promoting innovation does not endanger the progress made in basic research. Vincent Peillon  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the report presented by Mr Garriga Polledo on behalf of the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013. In a context where populism is on the increase, the effectiveness and even relevance of EU policies are regularly brought into question. Nonetheless, in the face of current crises, whether financial, economic, social or climatic, we do not need less but rather more Europe. This report therefore proposes finally giving the EU the resources to match its ambitions, by arguing for a substantial increase in the EU budget of a minimum of 5% and a mobilisation of the budgetary resources of the Union for the benefit of the EU 2020 strategy. Thanks to action by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the European Parliament also argues in this report for two strong measures: as far as revenue is concerned, an in-depth reform of the own resources system, in particular, through the creation of a tax on financial transactions (Tobin tax); as far as expenditure is concerned, the creation of a category of ‘intermediate regions’ to increase solidarity between the territories of the EU and ensure a fairer distribution of the regional policy’s Structural Funds.

 I voted against the resolution on the lessons to be drawn for nuclear safety in Europe following the nuclear accident in Japan, because I do not believe that the issue of the future of nuclear power – a crucial one for our fellow citizens – can be resolved by this House in a few hours through amendments adopted without any real debate. All the issues must be put on the table, and no options must be ruled out, which is exactly why we need time. At stake are the credibility of our Parliament and the wellbeing of our fellow citizens, who would not understand – and rightly so – if we were to commit them to long-term courses of action that we did not discuss calmly and exhaustively beforehand, taking into account the different national situations and the constraints of our common fight against climate change. Lastly, I should like to say how sorry I am that, due to extremists on all sides, Parliament has been unable to approve at this time an immediate increase in the safety of nuclear power plants, even though we in our group reached a consensus demanding the most serious, transparent and independent checks possible.

I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague and friend, Mrs Guillaume, on procedures for granting and withdrawing asylum in Europe. This text marks a major step forward in establishing a common European asylum system (CEAS) by 2012, thereby putting an end to the intolerable situation whereby, depending on the European country in which an asylum seeker applies for protection, his or her chances of being recognised as a refugee vary between 1% and 65%. Parliament has therefore spoken out in favour of greater justice and greater efficiency in the processing of asylum procedures. It proposes that each country observe the same enhanced rules on protecting rights and modernising procedures: free legal advice from day one, a framework for the time limit for appeals, special assistance for unaccompanied minors, and a faster examination of cases. Also, although I regret that the European right, which has a majority in Parliament, has managed to adopt amendments to the text which cast widespread, exaggerated suspicion on the sincerity of asylum seekers, I warmly welcome the adoption of this report. The ball is now in the court of those Member States that have yet to decide on our proposals. Vincent Peillon  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague and friend, Mr Arif, on the EU’s foreign direct investment (FDI) policy. With this document, Parliament formulates two, in my opinion, major requirements when defining how to frame future international investment protection agreements that are binding on Europe. The first requirement is that all these agreements include clauses compelling European investors to behave responsibly abroad in economic, social and environmental matters. The second requirement is that all these agreements leave scope for the governments of the countries receiving this investment to legislate for the common good. In the past, some private investment protection clauses enabled the adoption, by the third country, of social or environmental legislation to be regarded as indirect expropriation, resulting in compensation. We need to put an end to these abuses. While this Parliament has, for the first time, a say on such matters, the Arif report has fired a warning shot across the bows of the Council and the Commission as they prepare to open negotiations with India, Canada and, soon, with China.

rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

 Mr President, I should like first of all to thank Mr Kalfin for the excellent work we have been able to carry out together and, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for which I was the rapporteur, to thank my colleagues Mrs Hautala, Mr Lambsdorff and Mrs Giannakou. As he has done so himself, I am not going to review the positive points of the report and the proposal defended by Mr Kalfin on the climate change mandate, the increase in human resources, the attention paid to social and development aspects, the environment, human rights, the shift in focus of the guarantee towards countries that need it most, and a stronger link with EU policies. Parliament is united on all these points – let me make that clear – and it must remain so during the difficult negotiations that, as I have just heard, await us with the Council. I would like to draw attention to two shortcomings at this stage. I regret that neither the need to now prepare the EIB for microcredit nor the need to already begin the debate on the post-2013 ceilings has been taken on board, even though the Committee on Foreign Affairs voted for both of these things in the consensus reached by all the political groups. That is why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament decided, with the consent of Mr Kalfin and of the other rapporteurs, to table amendments in plenary on these two subjects. Lastly, there is one crucial point to which I should like, politically speaking, to draw your attention and which has been the subject of debate for years. When the Berlin Wall fell, we were able to react not only with the enlargement project, the practical arrangements of which some may question, but which is undeniably necessary, but before that, we established the EBRD so as to be able to support the necessary economic and democratic transition. The European Union, and also the EIB, as the power behind it, is the largest provider of funds to the other side of the Mediterranean. At the same time, however, we know that the payment of those funds will not continue beyond one programming period – in other words, beyond 2013, as I mentioned just now – and that the discussions that we are having today show that there may be difficulties in the future. There is a project – already adopted by the European Parliament and endorsed in the report on the Union for the Mediterranean – which is referred to in the Kalfin report being debated today, and it is the creation of a Euro-Mediterreanean codevelopment and investment bank. This would be a practical way, beyond rhetorical statements, of acknowledging the European Union’s will to support the major democratic movement taking place on the other side of the Mediterranean, and I hope that this will be seriously addressed and that steps will be taken, in the coming months, to promote the creation of that bank. Vincent Peillon,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, I should like to start by expressing my warmest thanks to all my colleagues who were involved in this report; this truly is a collective piece of work. We reached 28 compromises; compromises which enriched rather than watered down the strategic vision that we wanted to impart to this report, to our commitment to the Mediterranean. I should therefore like to extend my warmest thanks to Marietta Giannakou for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), Ivo Vajgl for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Hélène Flautre, and the rapporteurs for the opinions of the Committee on International Trade, Mrs De Sarnez, and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Mrs Tzavela. What was important, for us, was to make it understood that there are strategic issues at stake here for Europe. In fact, it is not just a question of thinking that the South needs us; we also need the South, especially in these times of crisis. If we want to have a long-term vision, if we want sustainable growth in a multipolar world, then we also need the South. In light of this, Europe needs to undertake to make the Union for the Mediterranean an area of peace, security and prosperity for its 800 million habitants and to look at this work as a long-term priority. It is this common will that allowed us to come together, because we know that the economic stakes, the demographic stakes, the geopolitical stakes that we are facing, like the social and cultural stakes, presuppose that we are capable of working with the other side of the Mediterranean. For us, it is also cultural and civilisation issues that are at stake. We know this; Parliament has worked in knowledge of the difficulties of setting up the Union for the Mediterranean for two years. We have not avoided tackling the question of conflicts taking place in the South, but we wanted to affirm very forcefully that it was precisely the approach of the Union for the Mediterranean, with specific projects, parity between North and South in decision-making bodies and the possibility, for example, of bringing Israelis and Palestinians to the same table, that was the right method for helping to resolve these conflicts and that, moreover, the Union for the Mediterranean should not be asked to pursue all the objectives at the same time and that it needed to focus on these specific activities. In this project – and I do hope that the second summit of Heads of State or Government will be held in Barcelona on 7 June – we, the European Parliament, wanted to send a strong message to the Heads of State or Government to tell them they must make a commitment because this summit must be a success. In light of this, we have pointed out the approaches that we think are necessary today. First of all, we need to remove certain obstacles, which, of course, include the financial and economic conditions. That is why the European Parliament hopes that the European Union will make a financial commitment commensurate with what is at stake, firstly in terms of what is left of the financial perspective 2007-2013, and that, in the financial perspective 2014-2020, the Union’s undertaking will be much greater, so that the six major projects on the table can be completed. We need to improve the economic and legal environment. We need to improve South-South regional integration. We also need, in addition to economic conditions, new political conditions, which is why we placed an emphasis on cultural integration, education, cultural projects and on the rights of men and women. To conclude: Europe, in this crisis, needs to look far and wide. We must not sacrifice the long term to the short term. We must assume our responsibilities. Europe needs the South. Vincent Peillon,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make three brief comments. Firstly, we have not been lacking in respect for anyone, especially not people who might be victims, but we considered that compassion, moral indignation and insults do not add up to a policy. Secondly, we have not, of course, ignored the conflicts which exist either in Cyprus or in the Sahara or, of course, in the Palestinian territories. Seriously, however, did we think, in the common foreign and security policy or in the various negotiations that have taken place, that it was up to the UfM to deal with these issues? You cannot be everything to everybody and confusion of the mind is not a recipe for efficiency. Thirdly, I too am sorry that the Council is not here. It is not a good sign when you find out that this lack of political will is giving us cause to believe – Dominique Baudis is right – that the summit on 7 June is in the balance. Be that as it may, Parliament will have assumed its responsibilities. The people who constructed Europe did so with a long-term vision and a keen sense – following the fratricidal wars that divided us – of the importance of specific policy. It is this same spirit that we wanted to develop with the Mediterranean in this report. With Europe in the throes of a major crisis, we need to be capable of defining a growth strategy, as I said earlier. We also need to ensure that we do not turn in on ourselves. When you turn in on yourself, when you stop having exchanges with the outside world, then you start to die. That is why I think that this collective piece of work is an important piece of work and I hope that the Heads of State or Government – who have not recently lived up to their historic responsibility – listen and take heed. Vincent Peillon  (S&amp;D

Madam President, as our fellow Members have said repeatedly this morning, the problem of financing the developing countries’ fight against global warming may cause the Copenhagen Summit to fail, when we were all hoping it would be a success. As we know, however, these countries are often the main victims of global warming, but they are not responsible for it. The industrialised countries have provided a substantial financial aid package. It is insufficient today, and even the declared amounts are not actually being honoured. This is what obliges us and will oblige us to find new sources of finance. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, following the lead of the Committee on Development, has acknowledged that there is now a need to consider the introduction of a tax on financial transactions of the Tobin tax kind. This 0.01% tax on speculative transactions would bring in USD 100 billion per year; in other words, the amount that it is estimated will be required by 2020 to combat global warming in developing countries. Therefore, Parliament, in following the lead of certain national political leaders, is assuming its responsibilities. I should like to know the position of the Council and the Commission and whether they will support us on this point.
