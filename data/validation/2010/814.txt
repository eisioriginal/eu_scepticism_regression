Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution that we will vote on contains three points, as the Commissioner has underlined. The first deals with bringing forward the date of the elections: the proposal is aimed at ensuring that the Commission will be in a position to start work at the end of the summer. We must verify whether this is feasible – as the Commissioner has pointed out – to ensure that the date chosen will affect turnout positively rather than negatively. I believe that the most important proposal, however, is for nominations by the political parties of candidates for the Commission Presidency, and I prefer to speak of ‘political parties’ here rather than ‘political families’, precisely in order to underline the need for the creation of genuine European political parties. This is very important if Europe is to capture the imagination of the European electorate. The declining turnout is due also to the fact that during the European elections various national rather than European matters are discussed. The European elections are seen as nothing more than a test of the domestic political situation. During the election campaign we must talk about Europe, and the citizens must be firmly convinced that their votes count for something in terms of European policies. I think that nominating candidates for the Commission Presidency would help to convince the citizens of this. Europe will certainly be discussed more than in the past in these upcoming elections, because the economic crisis has focused attention on the basic debate of whether there should be more Europe, less Europe or even an end to Europe. It is absolutely essential to give citizens the opportunity to choose the government of Europe and the President of the Commission. The third question has to do with the make-up of the Commission, apart from the question of gender balance: we are debating whether it might not be better for a quota of future Commissioners, established in numerical terms or in some less determined manner, to be drawn from among MEPs. This would also give the electorate the feeling that their vote makes a difference. For these reasons, I think that we should support the resolution. Carlo Casini  (PPE
),

 The continued insistence on calling for European documents against homophobia demonstrates that the true objective is different from the apparent one. The principle of equality of all human beings, their dignity and the consequent need to respect everyone’s freedom regardless of their sexual orientation is an accepted fact, on which all parliamentarians agree. It is reasonable, therefore, to suppose, as indeed is clear from the resolution in question, that the objective pursued by the emphatic rejection of homophobia is to make same-sex marriage acceptable. It is implicit in the text that there is an aspiration to educate children to consider a same-sex relationship as having the same value as marriage, as the foundation of the family and therefore of the state, as recognised by Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We must not confuse the duty to guarantee freedom for all citizens with the state’s promotion of and support for what constitutes its foundation. On this point, educational and cultural aspects play a fundamental role and we must therefore oppose a misguided line of action that will result in public harm. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Article 6 should be implemented and it should be implemented soon, because it is a legal obligation that is required of us. The committee that I am honoured to chair has worked quickly and I would like to thank Mr Guerrero Salom and my fellow Members who worked on this. A contact group has also been set up between the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly and Parliament and I think this link should be reprised once again. We now call upon Mr Bødskov and Mr Kallas to pick up the pace and come to conclusions. I will not hide the problems, which are not structural – since you might say that we have already resolved those – but certainly substantial and procedural. They, however, can only be resolved in practice, once the Union has acceded to the Convention. In terms of the substance, there is one particular issue. As far as I know, this is the only case in the world in which a declaration, a legally binding act on human rights, applies to a territory where there is another legal act – the Convention of the Council of Europe – which contains the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This certainly poses a few problems, especially in procedural terms: who will have the last word? That is the major problem, but we cannot resolve it now. Meanwhile, let us get on with accession. The solution will emerge from case law, probably using the principle that the European Court of Human Rights applies, whereby all other remedies must already have been attempted before recourse may be made to the Court. In this sense, the European Court of Human Rights could be the court of last instance, even after the Court of Justice of the European Union.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think I agree; I do not oppose what Mr Leinen said. As far as we are allowed to do this and propose this, I think my committee should bear the request in mind. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Equality between women and men is an undeniable achievement of the modern era. Its foundations are equal human dignity and universal recognition of human rights. Unfortunately, in the report we are discussing today, there is an unacceptable contradiction that radically changes its meaning. Human dignity and human rights concern all human beings and therefore also the most fragile, weak and poor. Demanding abortion as a woman’s right, hiding this request in a misleading fashion in a question on sexual and reproductive rights (which in itself is worthy of full consent, provided that they do not include the right to destroy the life of an unwanted child) is unacceptable. For this reason I cannot vote in favour of the report. I would like to add that equality between men and women does not mean having the same identity and that motherhood is the sign of a capacity for receptivity (what may be called ‘feminine genius’) that man does not have. In that sense, women can walk at the head of all humanity towards goals of freedom, justice, peace and solidarity. But, to be themselves, they must not walk alone, but rather accompany all the weakest people on Earth, starting off from their own children. Carlo Casini  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not able to go into detail about the three issues raised by the Commission. I believe that these issues should be seriously looked into. However, I am sure that there has been lengthy discussion on the matter by my Committee on Constitutional Affairs, when the constitution had not yet been approved and there was already criticism of it, for reasons that people are too afraid to voice. Firstly, because there is the reference …  (The President cut off the speaker) Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Many of the speeches in our long debate have been rather generic. It has not been clearly shown which provisions of the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights have been violated by Hungary, or which precise provision of Hungarian law should be censured. Only the Commission has indicated three more precise areas for investigation. I believe that in this regard we need to have faith in the Commission and in the Hungarian Government and Parliament. However, there is an underlying issue that needs to be brought to light. Attacks continue to be made on the Hungarian Constitution, but no one has the courage to indicate the real reasons why a certain European radical left-wing is supporting a campaign of denigration against a country which has great merit in the fight for democracy and freedom. What is disturbing about the Hungarian Constitution is the reference to Christian roots, recognition of human dignity from the moment of conception, and statement that the family is a natural state based on marriage between a man and a woman. I do not believe that these three aspects conflict with European values. In fact they are an exemplary description of the foundations of such values, which should be taken as a model by all of European law. Carlo Casini,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to thank all those who worked on this text, starting with the working group, in which all the leading members of the parties present in this House met, but also my committee, which did some valuable work on this issue. I believe that we need a very broad consensus to demonstrate that this Parliament is a transparent parliament, that it is concerned only with the common good, and that each one of us is personally honouring the commitment, made back at the time of the elections, to serve only the common good and European integration. Hence, I believe that there should be a very broad consensus, which is why I would ask Mr Gargani to withdraw his oral amendments; although they are worded very well, they would prevent this broad consensus from being reached. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the people are the foundation of democracy. ‘People’ means identity, a combination of history, traditions and ideals, but it also means unity and the desire to have a single government. On that basis, a single electoral system is clearly an instrument for building a population, a European demos
. This European demos
 still does not fully exist, as demonstrated by the fact that in the last European elections there was a much lower turnout and hence a lack of responsiveness, and by the fact that national debates have focused primarily on national problems and not on European problems. The proposals made in the Treaty of Lisbon should therefore be implemented. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament is not obliged to present or draft a uniform electoral law; the Treaty merely indicates that it has the power to do so, but it is an extraordinarily important power, and therefore we must not abandon our plan to undertake this reform of the 1976 Act. We will refer this document by Mr Duff – whom I thank once again in my capacity as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs – back to committee. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs adopted his text almost unanimously, and we are somewhat reluctant today to see it be referred back to committee. However, precisely because we must not back down in any way, I believe that Parliament should redraft the text so that it is more workable and can receive broader support, but that referral back to committee should not be a way of shelving the reform. The need for a European vision is not due solely to the fact that elections could be held in a transnational college; there is also the question of what the direct election by the people of the Members of the Commission or at least of the Commission President would involve. It is with that question that I shall therefore conclude my speech, extending my thanks once again to the rapporteur, Mr Duff. Carlo Casini  (PPE
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Prime Minister, I share in the thanks already expressed by others, though I am not going to specify the individual points that justify this gratitude. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO), which I chair, has had the chance to meet you on a number of occasions, including in your own country. We first met you as a delegation and then within the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs; we have witnessed the constant, unambiguous and pro-European commitment of the Hungarian Presidency. The AFCO would like to thank you in particular for your contribution this semester to concluding the report on the citizens’ initiative. Likewise, thank you for the statements that Mrs Győri made here just recently as she took on the commitment, on behalf of the Council, to adhere to the transparency register as soon as possible. The Polish Presidency can hardly fail to follow suit. Hungary chose ‘Stronger Europe’ as its slogan and I sincerely believe that this was well-chosen. You have succeeded in riding out a storm that was made even more intense by the criticisms levelled by Parliament. I must say, as a constitutional scholar – indeed, I have written a book on all the constitutions in Europe – that it is unheard of to try and criticise the constitution of a Member State for reasons of domestic policy. It is also unprecedented to say that a constitution is incompatible with European principles because it refers to human and family values, which are precisely the values of the European tradition and the very building blocks of Europe. I therefore thank you not only for the strong and courageous work of your Presidency, but also for the Constitution of Hungary. Carlo Casini,  
rapporteur

Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will make a single statement covering both matters, which are on the same subject. With this debate and the vote which will follow, we will conclude a task and a period of negotiations in the working group chaired by Mrs Wallis and composed of fellow Members from all political groups, as well as a Commission delegation led by Mr Šefčovič, which has resulted in the drafting of an agreement for the establishment of a common Transparency Register. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) has prepared this report in a few months and has also finalised a report on the amendment of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. Personally, I was very surprised at the amount of public attention that this transparency agreement has garnered. I fear that people think the results will have a greater effect than was actually pursued. Transparency is the defence of right political action, but it is not the right instrument for getting to the heart of corruption. The recent cases of journalists trying to corrupt a few MEPs could also happen outside parliamentary premises. Furthermore, would-be corruptors know how to avoid being identified and the registers are not, therefore, a silver bullet. The right tool for the job is criminal law. Yet if the criminal law of the Member States is not sufficient, we will need to reread Articles 82 to 86 of the Treaty of Lisbon, reflect on whether we can consider the corruption of MEPs to be cross-border crime or an act otherwise detrimental to the Union’s financial interests and determine whether or not to create a European Public Prosecutor, which would, moreover, be a significant step along the path to unity. The Transparency Register has a more modest task. In some countries the term lobbyist has a negative meaning, while in others lobbying is seen as an almost an act of public service because it informs decision-makers on issues they might not otherwise know about. This is especially important for the European Parliament, because often the issues faced by MEPs are very complex and technical and we almost always need to find a balance between businesses and countries with divergent interests. This is where lobbyists become very useful. So we shall no longer call them lobbyists but stakeholders. Of course, interests can be conflicting, and rightly so. I used to be a judge and I can say that cross-examination of opposing sides is considered a condition for uncovering the truth and obtaining justice. So, having lobbyists or stakeholders with conflicting interests is a good thing: what is important is that the judge – and therefore also the MEP – maintains his freedom of thought, independence, and his honest search for the common good. Hence, we have established the Transparency Register, in mutual agreement between Parliament and the Commission with the hope that the Council will soon join the agreement. Those who wish to represent their interests are free to have access to our premises but they must be listed in the Register, where all information needed to identify their legal and financial status will be recorded. The Register is public. There are also organisations that do not pursue selfish interests but try to collaborate in European policies in the name of general values, such as churches, political parties and regions. They do not need to be added to this Register: but, if they have separate offices exclusively tasked with maintaining contact with European institutions, they must be included in their Register, though subject to a different legal regime to stakeholders. As already stated, the new Register also contains an amendment to the Rules of Procedure. There are therefore two reports, but in any case this is just a first step towards more complete transparency. Some hypotheses are already being researched and could be turned into rules after further reflection hence point 9 of the document adopting the agreement indicates the possibility for the reports to carry the details of the stakeholders who met with MEPs during the preparation of the report in question. This broad provision for possible amendments leads me to express a negative opinion on amendments which would put limits on such future deliberations. I hope, however, that Council will join this agreement in short order and that there is also immediate and broad consensus in this House, a strong signal of the duty of transparency and also a call to action. I hope that the vote is nearly unanimous. Carlo Casini,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to clarify a few things. I too would like to strongly emphasise that this agreement was concluded long before the outbreak of the episode with the British journalists. Unfortunately, this is one way in which false information is spread through the media. For example, a major Italian newspaper, the Corriere della Sera
, has today poked fun at Europe by saying that we acted too late and only after these events with journalists. This is not true. It unjustly encourages distrust of Europe. The agreement had been reached long beforehand. If anything, this discussion has arisen with some delay because, once the scandal had exploded, we wondered if we could attempt to further strenthen the agreement. The text has, however, remained the unchanged. That is the first clarification. The second concerns the question of obligation. The register is already mandatory. Those who want to lobby must enrol themselves in the register. I cannot understand what ‘obligatory’ means: it cannot mean that all companies, all enterprises or all citizens must be entered in this register. That is not possible. If anything, it is up to individual MEPs, who, when approached by someone who wants to exert pressure on them, must invite them to register before making contact. The third point refers to possible future amendments. There is a working group for this purpose, which I think needs to have as much room for manoeuvre as possible. I agree that we should identify the lobbyists encountered during the course of the negotiations but I do not know if this task belongs only to the rapporteur or whether it should be extended to the President. We grant the working group the freedom to submit any necessary recommendations. Finally, I too wish to thank both Mr Šefčovič, who has made a huge contribution to the implementation of this agreement, and the representative of the Hungarian Government, for, among other things, the assurance given about the Council joining the agreement in short order, which without doubt has its own uncertainties seeing as the Council certainly represents the second chamber in this case. If the Council is also equipped with the register, this would therefore underline more effectively that the structure of Europe is made up of a government – the Commission – and a legislative body, consisting both of representatives of citizens and of states. Howver, I realise that there are still questions to be answered, since the Council of Ministers represents the states. I am, however, confident that we will come to a positive conclusion.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Giannakou, since she has carried out a great and intelligent piece of work. When we talk about political parties, we must take two problems into consideration. Firstly, parties are not much esteemed in any country. Secondly, when European elections take place, political parties are generally considered to pursue the interests of their national state and not the interests of Europe as a whole. At the level of public opinion, there is therefore a lack of positive esteem either for the parties or for their function in relation to the forging of Europe. We must therefore act urgently. Not only in the Treaty of Lisbon, as has already been noted, but in many constitutions, in almost all European constitutions, the function of the parties is considered to be of national interest, and thus crucial in the creation of democracy and the pursuit of common interests. It is important to stress that I am speaking about constitutions, and not ordinary laws, and that thus I am referring to the fundamental structures of the States and the European Union as a whole. It is thus pressing that we define a statute for parties that are truly European-facing, and not only an algebraic sum of individual national formations that have no permanent European structure on the ground. We need to see parties that think and act in a European context instead. The need I am describing is much more pressing if we really do want to see a uniform European electoral law which, hopefully, could even lead to a single European constituency to sit alongside the national constituencies. This will increase the individual European citizen’s sense of belonging to Europe. I come now to the core of my argument. As has already been emphasised – and I thank the Commissioner in advance – my committee has worked very hard, holding hearings and many meetings, but we need a proposal, an initiative from the European Commission, which brings together European parties within the law of the Union with a new legal form under public law, with a legal personality that is also valid in all Member States and with a uniform structure that allows them to act as representatives of the European public interest. I thank Mrs Giannakou and the Commissioner for their pledges. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everything is uncertain as regards the situation in North Africa. We do not know the immediate outcome of the civil war in Libya, we do not know whether the new political order in the Maghreb countries and Egypt will be conducive to democracy, or whether even worse conditions will arise with regard to democracy and relations with Europe. As for the arrival of an unstoppable stream of fugitives from the shores of Africa onto European shores and those of Lampedusa in particular, it is difficult, even in this case, to distinguish those who are fleeing from violence and fear of death, those who have, for example, escaped from prison, and those who are looking for a future that holds better things than the hunger in their country. We can nevertheless be sure of certain things. Firstly, human dignity must be respected in all human beings. Secondly, the European approach is to offer hospitality to all refugees. Thirdly, the borders of the individual states which form part of the European Union are the borders of Europe. Fourthly, there is a duty of solidarity among all European countries that are part of the Union: this was confirmed, strengthened and made legally binding by the Treaty of Lisbon, which also governs migration policy and the management of migratory flows in an area of freedom, security and justice. Fifthly, the instruments for coping with emergencies such as the current one are already in place, in the form of Directive 2001/55/EC, Frontex and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). The current situation is one of those situations that reveals whether Europe actually is or is not a reality. Commissioner, I greatly enjoyed your speech, but I think we should move from words to deeds. I am well aware of this and I know you will act. We hope that your proposal will be followed up. The important thing is that words are not enough: we need deeds to make Europe a reality. This is an opportunity to build Europe. Carlo Casini  (PPE
).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the strange thing about the Council’s proposal is that once it has been approved, it will pave the way for the creation of a permanent stability mechanism through an instrument of international law, and hence without a direct link to the institutional structure of the Union. This fact caused great concern in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which I chair, and which has the task of keeping an eye on the coherence of the Union's institutional framework. The simplified revision proposal therefore sparked a lively debate in which arguments based on the solid principles of the process of European integration came up against pragmatism and realpolitik
. In short, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs thinks that in order to deliberate on the proposal to amend the treaty, Parliament must assess the economic governance context under which the proposal falls. We need to know more about how the future mechanism will tie in with existing institutional structures. It would be a mistake to create twin structures which, in the long term, would carry the risk of the Union breaking up. The proposals and suggestions in the report by Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri aim to build suitable bridges between the Union’s institutional structure and the new mechanism. Moreover, I should like to emphasise that the Council must see these issues as fundamental for harmonious cooperation between the European institutions. I therefore strongly urge the European Council to take heed of this requirement and the consideration that it must give us, ahead of our vote on 24 March. As we await a positive sign, I should like to offer my heartfelt thanks for the brilliant work of the rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Hungarian Government has shown great sensitivity towards Europe and towards the principles upon which it is based in this affair. In fact, immediately after the approval of the Hungarian media law, a campaign was waged by the left, which used the phrase ‘gagging law’. In reality, only those who have experienced communism, fascism and Nazism know what a gagging law is, while democratic states know that freedom and pluralism of information are part and parcel of democracy. However, they should be harmonised with all other powers of the rule of law and must not harm, in particular, the foundation of democracy, which is human dignity. For example, Article 21 of the Italian Constitution does in fact guarantee freedom of information, but it also directly prohibits publications that are contrary to public morality. The 1948 law on the freedom of the press in Italy, which no one has ever challenged, lays down an obligation not for authorisation but for registration of any publication, as does the Hungarian law. The reservations that the European Commission itself has rightly expressed do not devalue the stated aim of the Hungarian law, and that aim of ensuring respect for human dignity is demonstrated precisely by the attitude that the Hungarian Government has taken by opening itself up immediately to the acceptance of criticism and taking responsibility for changing the law according to the guidelines provided to it. The statement that the fundamental rights of the European Union will be written into the Hungarian Constitution is also proof of Hungary’s fundamental desire to be part of European culture. In conclusion, I no longer understand the point of this discussion, except to ‘blame’ Hungary for having supported its government and parliament democratically by a two-thirds majority. Yet this gives Europe reason for hope, not reason for criticism. I am therefore grateful to the Commission and to the Hungarian Government. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Members who have already spoken have said practically everything. They have recalled the facts, assessed them and made specific requests. Therefore, as this is the last speech scheduled, I should like to add something that has not yet been said, and what comes to mind are the thoughts of a very great European, John Paul II, a man who very effectively helped to bring down the Berlin Wall. In his spiritual testament, he mentions the four values that underpin our future civilisation, that is to say, the civilisation of love: they are life, peace, bread and religious freedom. Then I think of everything that has been written by Giorgio La Pira, the former Mayor of Florence, who promoted large conferences on Christian civilisation at the height of the cold war. In his book Premesse della politica
 (‘Premises of politics’), he wrote that every political idea has a particular concept of man underlying it. For Christian Europe, he writes, man is essentially a praying being, that is to say, a being able to enter a dialogue, to conceive of the infinite and to talk to God. Taking away a man’s ability to take part in private and public dialogue is not only a negation of religion, but also a negation of man himself. I leave these thoughts with the House and with you, High Representative, as a contribution towards a concrete and effective commitment by our European Union, which is rooted in its Christian identity and never fails to proclaim its purpose of defending and promoting human dignity and human rights. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment aims to make our judgment on Egypt’s actions more incisive. It is not only a matter of acknowledging that Egypt has at least done something, but asking it to intervene quickly and immediately to free these hostages, urging the country never to use lethal force to repel people crossing the Sinai. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is also called upon to make immediate contact with the people currently being held hostage. ‘urges the Egyptian authorities to take all necessary measures to secure the release of Eritreans held hostage, to avoid the use of lethal force against illegal immigrants crossing the borders of the country, to protect their dignity and their physical and psychological integrity and to guarantee that detained migrants have the opportunity to contact the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and that the High Commissioner has access to all asylum seekers and refugees in custody’. Carlo Casini  (PPE
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, I should like to ask the proposer of the amendment to clarify an issue. According to the text read out, the requested intervention concerns all those who request the right of asylum. I should rather say ‘those who have the right of asylum’, because ‘who request’ is too dangerous, as there is the risk that anyone can request the right of asylum. Vice-versa, by coordinating this amendment with the intervention of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, it will be the latter that will assess this. In any case, I should ask the proposer to modify the amendment with the words ‘those who have the right of asylum’. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I am speaking above all to thank all the members of my committee for their good work, particularly Mr Lamassoure and Mrs Gurmai, who did a great job in achieving the aim of implementing one of the most important changes in the Treaty of Lisbon. The committee also listened to the opinion of all national parliaments and experts, working in close contact with the Commission – for which I offer my heartfelt thanks to Commissioner Šefčovič – and with the Council’s willingness to engage in dialogue, for which I should like to thank Mr Chastel. Applying Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure also worked very well, allowing us to work effectively with the Committee on Petitions. I personally supported the need for an annual deadline for the entry into force of the regulation and this was certainly not to delay its application but, quite the contrary, to ensure that its initial implementation will be carried out comprehensively and conscientiously so that all Member States, without exception, are able to fulfil the requirement to prepare participation and checking instruments. I believe that the greatest positive effect of the new scheme is to increase the awareness of EU citizenship, which has now been enriched by the power of participation in the legislative process, including providing the stimulus. I am also certain that the mechanisms provided will guarantee easy participation for citizens, while also preventing abuse. Ultimately, I believe that, with the Christmas festivities only a few days away, the adoption of this regulation represents a nice gift for European citizens and Europe itself. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 I abstained from the final vote on the Berlinguer resolution because Amendment 2 was thrown out. This was extremely important for ruling out possible erroneous interpretations of item 40, which states that Parliament ‘strongly supports plans to enable the mutual recognition of the effects of civil status documents’. The expression could suggest, for example, a European Union-wide obligation to recognise a union between people of the same sex registered in a Member State where such a union is permitted. In actual fact, we must distinguish between the effects of a completed legal action (in the case of marriage) and the effects of an official registration document. The latter bears full witness to what is documented (for example, that a homosexual marriage has been entered into in Holland) and this public witness is the effect of the official marital status document. However, the effects of the official registration document are something different and their recognition (for example, a survivor’s pension) is not permitted in a State that does not recognise them. Matters of family law are, in any case, part of the identity of individual states and cannot be touched by EU law. The possibility of a different interpretation led me to choose to abstain.

 I voted for Mrs Weber’s motion for a resolution on the Roma in Europe because of its balanced, constructive content. It is not enough to shout against discrimination, perhaps exploiting real and extremely serious problems for the purposes of party-political wrangling. Naturally, we need to firmly reassert the principles of non-discrimination, of free movement and the resulting rights and obligations – as does the resolution by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – but more important still is to undertake practical reforms to solve the problems, in order to implement fundamental human rights. Immigration is a European issue and the time has come, as called for by Mrs Weber’s resolution, to tackle it at European level. The Roma issue only partly overlaps with the issue of integration, and in any case it has specific features which must also be addressed at European level. The structure of the EU was designed on the premise of the territorial stability of the member peoples. A nomadic lifestyle may be a characteristic of a people, which must also be respected, but inclusion must come about in a spirit of solidarity, in accordance with European rules, without the individual Member States playing it by ear. This is the resolution’s proposal which won our support. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Freedom of the media is beyond discussion, and no one in any democratic system can dispute the need for the media to be independent and pluralistic. In an information society such as ours, however, it is becoming increasingly evident that independence does not mean the absence of any rules and that pluralism is not a sufficient value. The power of the media in an information society is really a public power which Montesquieu, were he alive today, would have tried to balance against the other powers: legislative, executive and judicial. These three traditional powers must also be independent, but a reciprocal limit is established between them. As far as I can see, this problem has not been examined in depth. I will restrict myself to making two remarks. Journalists’ right to freedom is a human right that is at least equal to the right to dignity and privacy of every citizen. A duty of checks and balances therefore also exists. Judicial power must be transparent, but certain investigations must be absolutely secret during the initial stages if the truth is to be uncovered in the interests of justice and, therefore, ultimately of the public. I believe that these two aspects are always neglected in our debates. By making this speech, I have attempted to leave some record of them. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Once again we have the regrettable situation in which arguments proposing unjust solutions to the issue of the right to life are being applied to the discussion of a real and serious problem (in this case the fight against HIV), thus making it impossible to vote in favour. The use of the words ‘sexual and reproductive health’ has now become the means by which to convince parliaments to promote abortion. We must not let ourselves be deceived. Everyone, including myself, for a start, must promote sexual and reproductive health, but when the words indicate a different and, in fact, opposite state of affairs (whereby killing a human being is understood as a woman’s right to freedom), it then becomes necessary to expose the deceit. Abortion in the world is a real tragedy, but it is a real tragedy in our Europe too! My intention in voting against the resolution is not to hinder the wide-ranging efforts to combat AIDS, but to oppose the method and the content that I mentioned. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their continued, determined and intelligent work. The committee which I chair, given the evident and sensitive institutional implications resulting from the creation of the new Service, has followed the preparation of the text of the agreement extremely closely since the very beginning. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs not only participated in the work of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, under the very strict definition of cooperation laid down in Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure, but it also selected both of the rapporteurs. I am certain that Parliament will approve the document by a large majority. There will be work to do in order to make the European External Action Service (EEAS) able to actually perform the role it has been given by the new treaty and by the enthusiasm of the rapporteurs. The Service is not only a way to increase the European Union’s presence in various nations throughout the world; it also has a very important symbolic value, which is to express the unity of the 27 Member States. It is a natural consequence of the recognition of the EU’s legal personality. It is an incredibly important step towards the goal to be reached. The more votes cast in its favour, the further that step will carry us. I hope it will be reinforced even further by the establishment of a European Diplomatic Academy, and I would like to nominate the prestigious European University Institute in Florence to develop it.

It is very sad that for years now, the European Parliament has been unable to resolve a tragic contradiction. In every document in which measures to combat poverty, hunger and violence in the world are admirably proposed, some manage to include the declaration, whether direct or indirect, of the so-called right to abortion as a vehicle for the health and development of populations. The initiative of some is met, on the one hand, with the virtual indifference of the majority and, on the other, with a certain diffidence of the minority. Yet the contradiction and the tragedy are obvious. The principle of equal dignity for all human beings and that of special, rightful solidarity towards the youngest members of society are being abandoned at the very time when we are supposed to be pursuing the objective of combating discrimination and protecting health. This has also happened today in the case of the Cashman report, paragraph 42 of which, in contradicting the entire document, has forced myself and a number of MEPs to ultimately reject the report as a whole. When balanced against one another, in fact, the bad points that are being promoted unfortunately outweigh the good points present in other parts of the text. Carlo Casini  (PPE
).

 Madam President, Mr López Garrido, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this membership is surely a sign of one of the European Union’s missions: the mission to defend and promote human rights. A mission that is already fully formulated and borne out by history, by the fact that individual Member States already belong to the European Council convention, by the reiteration that the general principles of the convention and Member States’ constitutions are now part of European law. So this symbolic gesture is extremely important. However, translating this ideal concept into substantive legal rules is not so simple: this report refers chiefly and ultimately only to institutional questions, and is completely acceptable. I must say that I also thank Mr Atondo, and am bound to report that the AFCO Committee on Constitutional Affairs – which I chair - has approved this document almost unanimously. We are therefore satisfied with this document, and I will not dwell on individual elements of it, because we fully support everything that the President of the Council and the Commissioner have said. I would like to make just one suggestion, since the statement about the institutional presence of European Members of Parliament within the European Council Parliamentary Assembly when meeting to appoint the judge and the judges is somewhat vague: I would say that there is a small problem with the relationship between the population of Europe, of the European Union, and the populations of other countries. Luckily, the regulation governing membership and representation in the European Council Parliamentary Assembly already states that there can be no fewer than two per State, and no more than 18 altogether. Given the importance of the European Union, I suggest that we should draw the line at 18. I must conclude, however, and so I will finish by saying that this resolution exposes a problem that it is worth examining in more depth, in other words, the problem that we have already highlighted many times of the relationship between the Courts. I believe we must reflect a little more upon this problem but, above all, on the problem of the European spirit: we are the European Union and, as stated in Article 2 of the Treaty of Lisbon, we are founded on human dignity and human rights – and equality is founded on human dignity. In Europe, we are not united on this point, and so we must reflect carefully on this concept of human dignity, its limits and what it covers. That is not the subject of this decision and this very welcome report, however. I thank the rapporteur. Carlo Casini  (PPE
),

I have cast my vote, which is categorically in favour of the two reports drafted by Mr Méndez de Vigo. I am satisfied for two reasons: the committee that I chair acted promptly, reaching a provisional agreement, and that agreement paved the way for the one reached today in plenary by a very large majority. From this perspective, I have endorsed the idea of voting against paragraph 5, introduced by an amendment of mine tabled in committee, to emphasise that the appointment of the 18 new Members will have to comply as far as possible with the provisions of the 1976 Electoral Act, which requires that Members be elected directly by the European citizens. Therefore, the preference will have to be for an automatic method that allows the candidates who received the most votes of those who were not elected during the last European elections to join Parliament. If, however, the national electoral system does not allow for such a calculation, we can resort to appointment by the national parliaments. Carlo Casini,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be very brief since the committee I chair reached a very comprehensive agreement, in line with what has already been said, and so there is no need to make the debate too long-winded. The problem which arose and was discussed in committee mainly concerned the following: both the Electoral Act of 1976 and the Treaty of Lisbon require Members of this Parliament to be directly elected by the peoples of the various nations. This is a problem for cases in which the electoral system used to elect MEPs for this parliamentary term does not allow entry into Parliament of candidates who did not obtain enough votes to secure a seat, but did obtain enough votes to allow their entry at a later date. Some electoral systems do allow this, but it appears that others do not. Therefore, if we do not wish to considerably delay the integration of the Members into Parliament, we should have recourse to exceptional, transitional appointment systems, as envisaged by the Council. Following lengthy discussions, my committee concluded that this is a fair position. We therefore support what has already been said. Indeed, I must say that I personally tabled an amendment proposing the appointment of observers for an interim period prior to the election of the new Members to this Parliament. Although this amendment is still under discussion, we shall have to vote against it – even if it is my amendment – since the compromise amendment provides for the swift, immediate integration of the MEPs into Parliament. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcomed the statements by Mr López Garrido and Mr Šefčovič. The new Treaty of Lisbon urges us to swiftly adopt a systematic course of action to promote the citizens’ initiative, which is testament to the existence of a European people. Indeed, it is a well-known fact that one of the harshest criticisms of the Union is that it is not a fully democratic structure. The Treaty of Lisbon has sought to reduce the democratic deficit in several ways, including by making provision for at least one million European citizens to submit a proposal for a legislative initiative. This new instrument, in order to be a serious tool, will have to produce legal effects of a certain importance. It certainly cannot have equivalent value to the pre-existing petitions which are signed by a wide range of individuals – a clear distinction must be made – and it must therefore be regulated in such a way as to prevent its abuse and still allow broad discussion, as the expression of informed and verifiable popular consensus. However, the most important aspect of the initiative laid down in Article 11 of the Treaty of Lisbon is its symbolic significance: the democratic deficit is being tackled not only by the decision-making power of the people’s representatives, but even more so by the very existence of a European people which is not just the mathematical sum of the citizens of the individual nations. Therefore, with regard to the rules we are considering, there are two aspects that I consider to be particularly important: the first concerns the subject matter, which must be – as someone already said – a European issue; the second is the distribution of the minimum number of signatories across a significant number of Member States, representing an appropriate percentage with respect to the electoral weight of each country. I hope that the new rules will help citizens of France, Italy, Germany, Spain and so on feel that they are, first and foremost, citizens of Europe. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 I voted against the resolution on equality between women and men in the European Union (2009), even though I agree with a great deal of its content, because we cannot call for equality for a certain category of people without denying it to another category of human beings. I refer to paragraph 38, which claims to guarantee women’s rights by ensuring them easy access to abortion. The destruction of the smallest and most defenceless individuals in the shape of unborn children cannot be considered a way of confirming women’s dignity and freedom. An anti-life conspiracy is at work, which uses tried and tested ways of deceiving us. We must reveal it for what it is. Putting together extremely fair requests with extremely unfair claims and twisting the meanings of words are stratagems that have proved effective during European Parliament votes, but I will have nothing to do with it. We cannot talk about the drama of abortion, which deserves the attention of politicians as well as moralists, without also recognising the rights of newborns or at least calling for proper education as far as respect for life is concerned and organising forms of support for difficult or unwanted pregnancies so that they can be allowed to reach their natural conclusions.

I should like to say how pleased I am, as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, about the agreement that has been reached on the principal lines of a new Framework Agreement between the Commission and Parliament. I must, however, make it clear that we need to think more deeply about the nature of the relationship between these two institutions. The outlook for democratic growth in the Union continues to be one in which Parliament is seen as representing the people and the Council as a sort of second chamber, representing the States. In such a context, the Commission should be considered as a government, and it is clear that this configuration would require rules that are considerably more detailed than the adjustments deservedly outlined today. I should like to add a thought on the citizens’ right of initiative. The relevant rules will have to be tailored to the effects that we consider must follow as a result. These effects must be considered in comparison with those stemming from the existing right of every citizen to submit a petition to the European Parliament and those connected to the limited powers of Parliament. Parliament has no power of initiative but it does have the power to request that the Commission initiate legislation. Carlo Casini  (PPE

With my emphatic vote in favour, I want to add greater force to the words spoken by President Barroso; words that gave notice of the construction over the next five years of a more united and stronger Europe. He began his speech by recalling the fundamental values of European unity, the most important of which is human dignity. I agree wholeheartedly, but the problem is that the word ‘dignity’ has become ambiguous, because it is used not only to guarantee life and human equality, but also to discriminate against and do harm to the most vulnerable members of society and even to justify death. I hope, therefore, that in the next five years, the Commission will work in such a way that the word ‘dignity’ will be restored to its unambiguous and true meaning. It is of symbolic importance that on 15 December last year, during the height of efforts to form the new Commission, 500 000 European citizens from 17 countries requested, in a collective petition, that our institutions interpret and implement the Charter of Fundamental Rights in every decision, on the basis of the equal dignity of every human being. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the principle of equality between women and men is part of the central current of the great river that has already freed foreigners, slaves, black people, and that is the principle of human dignity, the same for everyone. The Tarabella report and that of the Commission are therefore both commendable, because it is right to always insist thoroughly on this principle. There are, however, two critical remarks that I feel I should make. The flow of human dignity and equality should concern everyone, absolutely everyone, including those who are waiting to enter the world, unborn children. It is therefore unacceptable to do as point 38 of this report does, that is, to speak of abortion as an aspect of sexual reproductive rights, or women’s rights. No one is denying the complexity of problems where difficult and unwanted pregnancies are concerned – there are serious problems – but, in any case, these things should not be spoken about except in relation to the need to nurture respect for life and to offer mothers all kinds of help so that they can freely choose to continue with their pregnancy. My second criticism concerns the extension of the concept of sexual and reproductive health, as is done in recital X, beyond physical and mental aspects, to include social aspects as well. I wonder what it means that all sexual behaviour, whatever it may be, must receive from others justifications of wellbeing, and therefore recognition and praise. Does this not mean that we end up violating not only freedom of conscience, but also freedom of opinion? I will merely ask this question because I do not think it is a banal one. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in voting in favour of the joint resolution, I am highlighting the particular seriousness of the violence carried out in Malaysia in response to an exclusively nominalistic issue. Indeed, it is certain that both Christians and Muslims believe in only one God, who is the God of all men, believers and non-believers alike. The fact that He is referred to by different names is absolutely secondary. To claim that the Muslim God is only Muslim and can therefore be invoked only by Muslims, using a traditionally Muslim name, means returning to the ancestral and tribal view that there is a God for each group of human beings. In other words, it means contradicting the monotheistic idea that makes universal religions which, like Christianity and Islam, oppose idolatry and polytheism, great religions that are close to people. No less serious is the persecution of the Copts in Egypt. It was on the shores of the Mediterranean that monotheistic religions, which claim to be, and are, forces for promoting brotherhood and peace, were born. However, it is remarkable that it should be precisely on the shores of the Mediterranean, in Jerusalem – a holy city for those who believe in God, Allah and Jehovah – that the main breeding ground for conflict is found. It is precisely Egypt that is the most powerful country in the area, where Christians and Muslims must coexist peacefully in order to play a peacemaking role throughout the southern Mediterranean area.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for this Parliament, I am pleased that the Spanish Presidency attaches importance to the fulfilment of the structural reforms provided for by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in particular, with regard to the European External Action Service, to the Citizens’ Initiative, and to the European Union’s adherence to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, for which my committee has already appointed a rapporteur, the Spaniard, Mr Jáuregui Atondo, whom you already know. However, in an interview published in the Spanish newspaper, El País
, last Sunday, you expressed the wish, Mr Zapatero, that the law on religious freedom might result in Spain taking steps towards normalisation within all its public institutions. Thus, I would like, in this respect, to suggest that we reflect very briefly on the fact that Europe’s structures are a means of achieving an objective, and the European Union’s objective is confirmed in Article 2 of the Treaty of Lisbon: the promotion of dignity, equality, freedom and solidarity. I must therefore voice some concern about the direction in which this debate on values is heading. Cultural unity comes before economic unity. Europe’s spirit is stronger than the public – excuse me, judicial – structure. Europe’s spirit is rooted in the instinct for truth and beauty belonging to ancient Greece, in the cult of justice belonging to Rome, and on the basis of this extraordinarily great heritage it is Christianity that has added the value of human beings, always as equals from conception to natural death. Today, it is in the name of the Cross of Christ that we ask to go to Haiti, to be present in Haiti, because all human beings, and the poorest in particular, are at the heart of this. And so I ask you: what does ‘normalisation’ mean with regard to religious freedom? Does it mean perhaps preventing all citizens from publicly expressing their religion? Does it mean forgetting the roots, including the Christian roots, of our countries? Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the decision of the European Court of Human Rights has upset not only worshippers but also everyone who, for centuries, has viewed the crucifix as a sign of hope and solidarity, something providing solace and freedom from fear and pain. We hope that that decision will be modified by the Grand Chamber since it is clearly irrational. Should we do away with the very name of the Red Cross? Should we remove the huge crucifixes on mountain tops which tower over cities and valleys? Will it be prohibited for the Queen of England, as has already been mentioned, to be the head of the Anglican Church? Nevertheless, the case invites a very important reflection from a civil and political point of view: are human rights merely the rights of individuals, as parties isolated from a social environment, or is the right to express a specific form of piety also a right of the peoples? Do tradition, history, intelligence and art count for nothing when, for millennia, they have characterised a people’s identity? Furthermore, the question also rightly concerns the relationship between subsidiarity and human rights, and I note that the latter, aside from certain fundamental principles which must be considered universal and irrefutable, may be interpreted in different ways, and human rights may even conflict with each other. Why should a state be denied the chance, through its laws, to resolve these conflicts and to interpret and implement human rights according to the ethical views of its people? The issue therefore goes beyond the question of crucifixes. On other occasions, the European Court has recognised, with regard to the right to life, the exclusive power of the States to decide on the most controversial matters, such as the regulation of abortion and euthanasia. Now, the Treaty of Lisbon requires us to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights and consequently, as the European Union, also to respect the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights. Therefore, we ought to think about the new and different direction currently being taken by the Court. It would be a serious matter if a supranational power, especially if exercised by a limited number of people and not as the democratic expression of popular will, were to become repressive and demeaning, insensitive to people’s feelings and hearts and therefore ultimately opposed to freedom. This is why I hope that the resolution tabled by the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will be adopted with the votes of a large number of Members. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, the subject is an oral amendment to paragraph 131, on which I am in agreement with the other two rapporteurs, Mr López Aguilar and Mr Berlinguer. The current text states: ‘calls on the Council, the Commission and Member States to evaluate and review current international, European and national laws and policies on drugs and to promote harm reduction policies, notably with a view to the conferences on those issues held at UN level’. The oral amendment proposes inserting the words ‘prevention’ and ‘recovery’, meaning that the call to evaluate and review laws would concern ‘harm reduction, prevention and recovery policies’. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution because it indicates the right way to strengthen European unity around the fundamental values that constitute its very identity. We cannot fool ourselves that it will be possible to achieve agreement on so-called common values. We may nevertheless hope that the application of reason can help the various political components to look more closely at what is right and fair where progressing along the road to European unity is concerned. The clear distinction between the right to free movement and the principle of non-discrimination, on the one hand, and the value of the family as a natural society founded on marriage, on the other, has led to the formulation of the paragraph that upholds the independence of individual States in family law and the ban on discrimination against any human being. Those who, like me, fully promote the principle of equality, affirming equality between children who are born and those who are not yet born, can only support the principle of non-discrimination against people with different sexual tendencies, but cannot accept the destruction of the concept of marriage or of the family. The significance of this concept, as recognised by Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is fundamental to the succession of generations and the educational capacities of heterosexual couples. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which I have the honour of chairing, gave me the task of acting as rapporteur on this document, together with the rapporteurs from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs, sitting jointly. This is the first time that Rule 51 of the Rules of Procedure has been applied and I must say that, in my view, the result has been very satisfactory with regard to the cooperation between the three rapporteurs in carrying out their work. There have, in fact, been problems, some of them serious, with regard to the timeframe and, above all, the involvement of the shadow rapporteurs and the timely translation of the amendments, of which there were nearly 500. However, all that is due not to Rule 51 itself, but rather to the very short deadlines that we gave ourselves in order to have a document that we could submit to the Council summit taking place on 10 December. It was thus inevitable that there would be these problems linked to the pace of work. For the rest, I believe that we should acknowledge that Rule 51, which has been used for the first time, is useful. The document under consideration by this Parliament cannot be explained in the few seconds that remain to me. However, I must express my satisfaction that the codecision system has been extended to become the normal system of legislation, that immigration is now understood to be a European issue – and I hope that this is how the Commission and the Council interpret it – and not a problem for individual Member States acting in solidarity with each other, that the view taken of cooperation with the national parliaments is not that they are guardians laying down limits, but rather positive collaborators in the legislative process, and finally, that there is that reference to human rights which is extremely important, and which is the spirit of the European Union. I therefore believe that, in view of the fact that it was not supposed to detail down to the finest particulars the implementation of the Stockholm Programme, but only to formulate general outlines, this document is certainly a positive step. There will be time and a way in which to make it more comprehensive, and to include more details. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we shall of course respect your decisions, but it is my understanding that there are some reservations about certain amendments, namely that they do not directly relate to the Treaty of Lisbon. I may be mistaken, but it seems to me that, until now, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has had general powers to make proposals concerning regulatory amendments. It can do this if the amendments are suggested by a group of Members, or by individual Members, and also on its own initiative. Therefore, the fact that the opportunity has been taken to make a few corrections, also with reference to other aspects, within the ambit of a wider reform of the Rules of Procedure under the Treaty of Lisbon cannot, in my view, be seen as unacceptable – all the more so since quite a few amendments would serve to reflect the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon in the Rules of Procedure, sometimes through rules that are reproduced technically and materially in them, but much more often through reference to the spirit of the treaty. One need only think of the role of Parliament, which has been strengthened in relation to the Council, but which is also being strengthened by the Rules of Procedure where the internal relationships with institutions within Parliament itself are concerned. We shall, of course, respect your decisions, Mr President, but I felt it was necessary to make these observations. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, first of all I wish to correct my first and second votes – I meant to abstain, but I made a mistake because I acted in haste and pressed the wrong button. My first two votes are abstentions from the whole day’s votes. The statement I am making is this: there is a grave original sin in the proposal that has led to today’s debate and it is a sin that has already been pointed out by the President of the Italian Republic. Added to this sin is the opportunism of choosing the Italian Prime Minister’s legal action against certain newspapers – a process that is clearly in full compliance with the rule of law – as a means by which to attack him. Therefore, we have not voted for the proposal by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, and so on, but nor have we voted for the motion by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) because, although it deserves recognition insofar as it safeguards Italy’s dignity, it totally overlooks the problem of the balance between the media and the other state powers, which exists in Europe and which is a serious problem in Italy too. This does not just concern the Italian Prime Minister’s conflict of interests in this area; it concerns other problems too. At national level, on the other hand, my party, the UDC, is continually challenging the majority on this. I believe that we, too, must send out a message of support by abstaining. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I all I feel it is my duty to thank the rapporteur, who has done a marvellous job, and, as chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I must also thank all of the members of the committee and of both committees – the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development – who delivered the opinion, for their very swift work. We have, in fact, tried to prepare a document – which I hope will be approved – that can be presented to the Council of 29 and 30 October. We are well aware that this report is not a definitive report. It is intended merely to point out a few courses of action, a path of some kind to follow, to the Council and thus to the High Representative who will be appointed. It will be the High Representative’s job to devise his own organisational plan which, in turn, will have to be examined by us. Therefore, it is only guidelines that are being submitted to our Parliament. We also know that the success of this operation regarding the External Action Service is linked to the role of the High Representative, who will have to be able to organise and manage everyone. Through him, we want a consistent and uniform foreign policy. We are well aware that there are problems, that much has already been said, but problems are there to be solved. The important thing is that the compass, the information, the scope is clear. The Brok report provides some interesting proposals in this regard – I have to be brief because my speaking time is up – but, in any case, they include the integration of the Service into the administrative structure of the Commission, the decision to further develop the Community model and the proposal, which is, moreover, laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, that the staff must be taken from the secretariats of the Commission and the Council and from the delegations of the Commission itself. There are two innovations that I believe are worth mentioning: Union embassies, headed by officials from the European External Action Service, which would also include the Commission delegations present in third countries and the Council liaison offices, with the possible secondment of experts from the Directorates-General; and the foundations that have been laid for the establishment of a European diplomatic college, which is an interesting idea. My speaking time has run out. I only hope that this report really is adopted, and adopted by a large majority. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to rationalise an apparently ambiguous feeling that I have after this first stage of the debate, because I fully subscribe to the strong words spoken by my chairman, Mr Daul, but I also subscribe to the words of Mr Sassoli who should, by all rights, be a political opponent of mine. Let me explain myself better: am I schizophrenic for having such ambivalent feelings, or am I trying unnecessarily to reconcile the fact that, in Italy, I sit on the opposition benches while, here, I find myself next to the People of Freedom party, in the People’s Party? I feel I can answer that by highlighting an obvious contrast between the scope and the importance of the subject of freedom of information, which is a very important subject… Were Montesquieu alive today, he would have spoken not only of legislative, executive and judicial powers, but of other powers too, and he would have put the fourth power, the press, in first place, as it represents a problem of freedom, of the fight against mental slavery, and a problem of democracy. On the other hand, the straw that broke the camel’s back after months and months of barbarisation of the entire Italian press – let it be said – of the right and of the left; the quality of the Italian press has been poor for months now because politics really has reached a low point – was Mr Berlusconi’s legal action. Please indulge me: I was a criminal judge for four years in the Fifth criminal division of the Court of Cassation, where we judged the crime of libel. This is how I know Mr Mauro is right: I saw many of these actions for libel, and no one protested. Citizens have the right to defend themselves in these situations too. I therefore hope that, by making a genuine attempt to reconcile seemingly opposing points, we will actually come up with a new and better way of tackling the problem for the whole of Europe and not just in regard to Italy. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, I was also told I had three minutes, but I will try to stay within two minutes. I would like to join many of my fellow Members in expressing my satisfaction. I think that it is now time to put into effect, to implement the Treaty of Lisbon as soon as the ratifications take place, something which we hope will happen imminently. The committee which I chair has been doing everything in its power for some time now but, above all, it is important for Parliament to be aware of its new responsibilities: it must not allow the de facto 
loss of any aspect of its wider legislative functions. I would, however, like to highlight one issue which I do not think has been raised so far: there were many reasons why the Irish people previously rejected the Treaty, but one was the fear, among some voters, that the European legal system could violate, in Ireland. certain fundamental values concerning the right to life and the notion of family. These fears were allayed through declarations adopted by the European Councils of December 2008 and June 2009. I think this is important not just for Ireland, but for the whole of Europe. It was clarified, in fact, that the acquis communautaire
 does not concern the area relating to the right to life and the family. This clarification does not apply solely to Ireland, but to all the Member States. In reality, there was no need to clarify this because in various judgments involving France, the United Kingdom and Poland, the European Court of Human Rights had already ruled that in the areas of life, the value of life, respect for life and the family, it must be left up to the Member States to decide according to their history, tradition and culture. However, Ireland’s attention to detail had the merit of formally clarifying this point which, as I was saying, now applies to the entire European Union. I believe that this is a good thing, which makes holding the double referendum worthwhile. Naturally, we know full well that European culture consists of the sum of the cultures of all of the countries that make it up, and we all want Europe to be not just an economic area but also, and above all, a community of values. I therefore think it proper that we show Ireland both our satisfaction and our gratitude for everything that it offers Europe in terms of its history and its ideals. Europe needed Ireland, not only for technical reasons relating to its mechanisms and organisational structure, but also for Ireland’s contribution to what we are all seeking: the essence of Europe.

My judgment on the motion for a resolution on the protection of minors in Lithuania is intended to demonstrate a very serious institutional concern. Often, individual MEPs or political groups claim to address issues that relate to the domestic policy of individual States: that does not seem right. In the case in point, the plan is seemingly to make the European Parliament express an essentially negative opinion on a Lithuanian law – the full content of which is unknown – with the laudable aim of protecting minors, while surreptitiously imposing a position that the individual Member States have been left to establish at their own discretion. This, I might add, is something which the European Court of Human Rights has stipulated on many occasions. The principle of equality is beyond doubt, and no one is trying to call into question the dignity of persons with particular sexual orientations. My reservation is of an institutional nature because it concerns the relations between the European Union and individual Member States. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 While, in non-EU countries caught up in the current crisis, the fight for growth and jobs is being met with economic and financial leverage – whether legal or monetary – under the control of a single political and administrative body, in Europe, we continue to endure political delays from an EU that still cannot overcome the issue of unitary governance. This situation is aggravated by the fact that, despite the major ongoing effort to strengthen coordination between Member States on their own budgets, conclusive action to coordinate tax systems is still excluded from political debate, especially in respect of the direct taxation system. This delay produces tax competition that could also be construed as dumping, which has a negative impact, especially on the stability of businesses, including geographically, and risks, above all, affecting areas that are already weak and corporate social responsibility. This is why I regret the failure to adopt the part of the amendment that highlighted the risks of tax competition, to the detriment of consolidating national budgets, and, to this end, suggested the introduction of a minimum rate of corporate taxes. I hope that we can make up for this delay in the near future. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 The ongoing global crisis has made clear the lack of political involvement in supra-national economic governance, especially in the European Union. When, way back in 1988-1989, European leaders took the brave decision to begin convergence of the Member State economies with a view to the single currency, both by completing the internal market and by coordinating the Member States’ economies, it was made very clear, from a pro-EU point of view, that this objective could only be fully achieved by twinning the pillar of monetary governance, under an autonomous European Central Bank, with the pillar of economic governance exercised by Commission, Council and Parliament. Only the two pillars together could underpin the future of the European Union. However, this sharing of responsibilities has to be combined with the sharing of opportunities and economic results. Just as, at the national level, varying rates of regional economic growth are balanced out by single-state governance, including by joint participation in the public debt, the same should happen at European level in relations between Member States, which should evolve, making shared, cooperative and reciprocal destinies a reality. I think that this report and the amendments that have been adopted are in line with this view. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 A local authority has the utmost political autonomy when it achieves total control on tax matters, and therefore has total economic and financial control over deciding its budget. Unfortunately, the serious delay in achieving this level of autonomy is particularly clear with regard to the agreement on the multiannual financial framework. During this very process, European and pro-European ambitions and responsibilities clash with the selfishness of the Member States, resulting in increased national and nationalist sentiment. It is regrettable that the political mentality that always made the common European interest a priority has been lost, replaced by an accountant’s mentality where what is given to the European budget and what is received nationally under ‘community’ policies are continually set off against one another. The EU will only reach its full political potential by boosting its powers on budgets and taxing genuine own resources, including through eurobonds and a financial transaction tax, and boosting its resources, so that they are suited to meet the challenges and political objectives that it aims to pursue and achieve. It seems to me that this joint resolution is heading in that direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

The global financial crisis, which began to show itself in 2008, is, unfortunately, far from over. Instead, in some ways, with productive sectors now weakened by the period we have gone through, it seems even more serious and now might become structural within economic systems. On the other hand, even the repeated and numerous recurrences of the original causes of the crisis demonstrate that the ‘market’ is not an abstract entity that can regulate itself efficiently, as experts in the new welfare economy would still have us believe, but that it is, instead, a system managed by a few individuals worldwide who, often unscrupulously, attack financial markets, productive systems and institutions with the hope of profiting from their weakening or even from their failure. The actions taken by each individual country are not enough to address this global crisis. What we need are decisions made at an equal level. The financial transaction tax would be useful in mitigating the devastating effects of raider activity, especially if it were adopted globally and if it did not impact on national bonds or pension funds. Meanwhile, and in the hope that this might happen, it is important that it should start, at least, with the European dimension. This report and the amendments adopted are in line with this outlook.

The globalisation of the economy has led to the need to step up economic cooperation between the EU and other areas of the world. This aim needs to be pursued not only through various fundamental principles that make trade balances sustainable, although these are, of course important, but, above all, through support for the EU’s production systems, to make them more competitive on the world stage. It is therefore necessary for both the principle of legal and economic/financial reciprocity and the anti-dumping principle to always be an integral part of economic agreements, with particular reference to the fiscal and social security dimensions, so that a correct approach may be taken based on the comparative and competitive advantages of enterprises and production systems. In addition, it is necessary for the principle of reciprocity to permeate access to Chinese public procurement. Finally, the EU ought to take a more farsighted and attentive approach to investments in developing countries, made also by competing countries, such as China, in order to better evaluate the impact of these interventions in political, economic, social and environmental terms. I believe that the report we have adopted seeks to achieve these objectives. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 The social dimension of our communities – particularly small and medium-sized ones – is more significant than their economic weight. In this vein, I would like to underline that some essential services, such as those relating to people’s health, the environment (including the water and waste cycles) and local public transport, should be thought of as directly connected to fundamental human rights. This is because they can be defined, in political terms, as public goods and services, even if they are managed by private entities. Making them more efficient, effective and economical, while pursuing increased and higher quality standards is another thing. Moreover, denying access to many sections of the population, especially the most vulnerable and neediest, whenever we apply the rules of the market plain and simple to these sectors is something else entirely. That is why, given their special status and social relevance, in the next reform being drawn up, we must retain a precise distinction between the rules that regulate State aid for services of general economic interest and the rules that govern other forms of State aid. The adopted report partly upholds this view. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 Different rates of development and the changes in the ways of life that exist in our societies have led to profound variations in the demographic pyramid. If higher life expectancy is a positive aspect of these changes, the same could not be said for others, in particular, for those that concern young people and women. With regard to these categories of the population, elements that have been shown to be inadequate include work policies that have put a strain both on training (including at university and post university), in favour of a more pronounced trend towards entering the world of work, and on accompanying policies concerning remaining in work, with a view to greater fulfilment of family needs. To this end, among the initiatives to be reinforced by more profitable use of Structural Funds, one could, on the one hand, include the provision of services in support of guidance and of satisfying the demand for work with job offers, whereby these services are adequate, operational and easily accessible to those who require them. On the other hand, one could intervene by strengthening policies in support of the family (including greater diffusion of public or private nurseries and organisation of flexible work). I believe that the approved report leads in this direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 Economic, social and territorial cohesion policy is one of the fundamental pillars on which our coexistence within the EU is based, as it promotes growth in areas struggling to develop in order to enable them to converge and compete fairly against more developed areas. The experience acquired also during the current programming period shows that delays in development are effectively recouped on the one hand by simplifying rules and procedures, while maintaining a rigorous pursuit of objectives, and, on the other, by strengthening the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of management and control systems. All this has to take place within the context of the broad and effective involvement of all the institutional, economic and social partnerships at the various local levels in order to identify the strategies and specific and operational objectives to be pursued. In addition to this, there needs to be effective programming and unified implementation by the different EU (structural, agricultural and neighbourhood policy funds) and national funds, recognising in project funding the capacity for integration of the various areas and production and the different private and public entities, including in a cross-border, inter- and intra-regional context. I believe that the report that I helped to approve contains these suggestions. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

Food security is a prerequisite for achieving balanced development at all levels. Its relationship with sustainable production in the primary sector can be seen in a number of different ways. In environmental terms, it is expressed through the use of eco-friendly techniques and products and through a non-speculative enhancement and management of the immense natural resources that are found in developing countries in particular. In economic terms, it is expressed partly by enhancing the competitive advantages between the various areas and countries – which can also enable developing countries to play an integral role in balanced and global growth – and partly by promoting the link with the land through a focus on locally sourced products, where energy costs and pollution linked to transport and the quality and tradition of the products can be better protected. In social terms, the processes of gradual urbanisation and population growth, above all, in developing countries, have to be reconciled with the needs of living in these places. Lastly, in political terms, because the primary and food sectors represent the most tangible, daily platform for relations between people, including in their relationships with institutions. I believe that the report we have adopted upholds this view. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 Economic cooperation, including trade cooperation, is one of the instruments through which foreign policy is implemented. The European Union is founded, first, on sectoral trade and, second, on the wider single market: a foundation that is still suffering from the lack of a single foreign policy; a wide-ranging, strong and authoritative policy that helps to define strategic positions on economic cooperation with other countries and geopolitical regions, as well. This situation allows each Member State to develop in an independent and uncoordinated fashion, either on its own or in the various international organisations to which it belongs. In order to ensure that the Doha negotiations have a favourable outcome, while also reiterating the usefulness of the World Trade Organisation as a forum for solving the problems of balanced development and cohesion among all the member countries, we need to work on integrating the other countries, too, into long-term policies, firstly by building on their competitive advantages, and secondly by strengthening their ability to shape their own development. I believe that the adopted report makes a contribution, however small, to this prospect. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 Economic, social and territorial cohesion policy is one of the fundamental pillars of an EU that is in favour of bridging gaps in the development of geographical areas and sectors of society and the economy. If correctly focused on people and bottom-up subsidiarity, it allows the promotion of integrated, systemic growth, stimulating initiative and civic sense and fostering the development of responsibility and the common good. The experience of the current 2007-2013 programming period has taught that in the next programming period we need above all to give greater responsibility to the actors, beneficiaries and targets of strategic and operational programming, as well as to its implementation, monitoring and the assessment of whether objectives have been met, through programmes providing incentives and disincentives to encourage the meeting of targets and allowing greater transparency in the processes and work involved in active participation in them. It is also important to make the entire structure of governance and management simpler and more flexible, and to foster the capacity for integration of the different territories in a cross-border, inter- and intra-regional sense. Finally, it is necessary for the resources and objectives of cohesion policy in the next programming period to be in line with the challenges the EU will be undertaking, including the EU 2020 strategy. I think that the report I helped to approve shows the right way to do this. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

The internal market, competition policy and fundamental freedoms have accompanied the growth of an open and integrated Europe. The economic vision that led to its creation in the beginning is not the only dimension of a political reality that intends to take part in governing globalisation. This contains other dimensions which generate shared visions and policies which have to make people the focus of their attention. This change of approach makes it even more important to encourage the creation of an economic and social context in which the need to develop one’s own identity and the response to the fundamental needs of daily life and future prospects are what drive public actions. In this context social services of general interest take on a bigger, different role in which the financial aspect, in terms of budget compatibility and medium- and long-term sustainability, play a important part, but only in the context of the primary objective of developing human beings and quality of life in a family, social, working and institutional sense.

 Economic, social and territorial cohesion policy is one of the fundamental pillars of an EU that is conscious not only to promote and develop excellence by encouraging innovation, but also to create convergence and bridge the gaps of and in less developed areas compared with more advanced ones. Joint programming was the most innovative aspect of the period 2007-2013, having led the regions and the Member States to adopt an integrated approach between territories and resources as part of their strategic and operational programming. However, this important approach is liable, in many cases, to be frustrated by the considerable autonomy and strong competition existing between the various authorities in charge of managing each monofund programme. By failing to work together properly, they seriously endanger not only the valuable integration of operations and actions that could be achieved, but also the benefits and the impact that those actions could create. In the next programming period, then, it may be worth reverting to multifund programmes, incorporating in them the experience gained from joint programming and encouraging shared and responsible management between the various stakeholders in charge of regional development. I believe that the adopted report makes an effective contribution to these objectives. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 The agricultural sector still plays a strategic role today in our societies and economies. It does so firstly from a food perspective, since not only does it provide the raw materials for food, but the safety of that food is essential for our health. It does so secondly from an environmental perspective, since the vitality of the sector and the quality of its production processes make for environmentally friendly land management. It does so thirdly from a social perspective, since it represents a challenge to provide high-quality, innovative jobs for young people. It does so fourthly and finally from an economic perspective, since a local/global approach allows for the economic development of traditional, high-quality, certified and high added value products, through the adoption of management models that turn businesses and their products into competitive cooperatives on a global scale. A fair CAP that promotes micro, small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises and high-quality, traditional and certified products, that supports environmentally friendly processes, that introduces aid ceilings and that sets aside sufficient resources for rural development is an ambitious and far-sighted policy that benefits citizens, consumers and agricultural operators. I believe that the adopted report offers this possibility. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

One of the fundamental objectives of the European Union is to link human and social development to economic development. If these two factors are in balance, then this means, on the one hand, that people can do their work with adequate remuneration that is in line with human dignity and professional quality, while, on the other hand, it allows business owners to develop their businesses by following market principles, though tempered by the human environment in which this must take place. This perspective – which some people also call the social market economy – is actually a new paradigm that goes beyond welfare economics and returns instead to the centrality of the human being. Such a paradigm shift necessarily involves consistent support for social policy, including fostering the relevant standards and related corporate responsibility. This approach and vision cannot, and must not, have an impact merely within the EU, but must also be applied to external action wherever possible, particularly during the negotiation of agreements. Respect for International Labour Organisation standards, the principles laid down in the European Social Charter and social dialogue are just some of the areas that can be discussed on these occasions. I believe that the report we have adopted offers sound backing for these objectives. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

Indicators are a concise way of interpreting a given phenomenon. Simple phenomena can be interpreted using simple indicators, while complex phenomena require complex indicators. Gross domestic product is a simple indicator, while development is a complex phenomenon. Indeed, the economic development of an area has various dimensions that are not included in GDP, which takes a snapshot of a given moment. Other elements of interpretation are totally neglected, such as investment in intangible infrastructure, including know-how (people, processes and products, to mention just a few examples), and investment in tangible infrastructure, including communication and transport networks (ICT networks and road and rail networks, for example). In addition, GDP is not even suitable for identifying regions assisted by EU regional cohesion policy. For these reasons, the European Commission’s efforts to go beyond GDP and create a series of data and indicators that will improve its ability to interpret phenomena and help to better define policies and financial allocations should be commended. The report that we have adopted seems to me to be moving in this direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 The economic and financial crisis has highlighted the total lack of ethics in this area. The paradigm of the new welfare economy, whereby the pursuit of individual wellbeing is the key to collective welfare, which is the sum of its parts, is apparent in all its inadequacy. According to this approach, individual interest does not set any limitation on the collective interest, let alone the general interest. Yet because public government must set general interest as a framework within which to operate, and provide free space for freedom and individual rights within it, it must support this with a fair and progressive tax system. Consistent with this approach, which must be supported at global level by the EU and all G8 and G20 countries, the revenue from financial transactions must be made comparable to other revenues through a specific tax system that favours greater responsibility by operators together with other rules and new paradigms. The introduction of Eurobonds designed for the crisis fund and infrastructure projects could strengthen the EU’s ability to take action if they were additional to the EU budget. The report that we have adopted seems to me to be moving, albeit slowly, in this direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 Agriculture represents a strategic sector for the European Union. While its impact in terms of employment and GDP may not equal that of other sectors, it assumes greater significance with regard to the characteristics of our respective regions and food traditions, since it ensures that we are self-sufficient in many ingredients that are essential for our farm produce, traditional or otherwise. Furthermore, this sector plays a fundamental role in safeguarding and protecting the environment and ensuring the sustainable development of our regions. It is obvious that trade agreements have to be made, particularly in the trade rounds of the World Trade Organisation. For that to happen, however, the European Union has to pay more attention to safeguarding quality, traditional and certified products, so that they can be protected internationally to avoid fraud on foreign markets involving products that have been falsely attributed to our countries. The basic tenet of the approved report seems to go in the right direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the proposed text because pensions are one of the fundamental institutions of the system of worker’s rights and duties. They are essential for the continuation of a decent standard of living for the people concerned and for their whole families, especially when it comes to receiving adequate support so as to attain a decent standard of personal and family life. By setting this threshold as a long-term goal, it is obvious that sustainable pension systems are necessary to offer certain minimum prospects to workers. While I respect the principle of bottom-up subsidiarity, with primary authority and responsibility for adequacy and opportunity for reform lying with the Member States, there is a need for convergence of pension systems in Europe, so as to ensure full and genuine freedom of movement for workers and enterprises and also full and mutual recognition and parity of the various pension systems within the Member States. Indeed, while I acknowledge the differences in the cost of living and in wage levels between Member States, there is a need to establish long-term convergence both internally within each Member State and within the EU as a whole, so as to promote a decent and adequate level of life expectancy.

The internal market and competition policy are two cornerstones of the process of European unification which aim not only at strengthening the European Union’s economy and its businesses but, above all, at realising the fundamental freedoms of the Union. This objective must be pursued in the interests of all European citizens and enterprises, offering equal opportunities and substantial equality while avoiding problems, additional costs and superstructures that could differentiate, discriminate between or limit the opportunities to enjoy or protect one’s own rights. Giving all European Union citizens the right to express themselves in their own language in dealings with the EU institutions is a fundamental right in terms of equality, equal opportunities and non-discrimination. The use of just some of the official languages can technically only be justified within the activities of the EU institutions and not in its relations with citizens, enterprises and institutions in the Member States. Enhanced cooperation procedures are useful when they increase the opportunities for those that participate in them, without compromising them for the others. I therefore voted against the recommendation since I think enhanced cooperation is unacceptable in such a delicate context as the political equality of languages, as it would create discrimination in terms of the right of equal opportunity to access the EU’s fundamental freedoms.

Humanitarian aid now has a larger and more important role than in the past. Differing rates of development and growing inequality in opportunity and resource distribution in geographical, social and generational terms, increasing climate change (for which humans are partly to blame) and the associated increase in natural disasters, increased environmental pollution, imbalanced anthropic pressure concentrated in large urban areas, and uneven population growth in some areas of the planet, have led to a rising number of humanitarian disasters in which aid takes on an essential role in restoring basic living conditions and human dignity. In view of this, if humanitarian aid is needed to assist people hit by disasters, then in turn, any interventions as a result of EU foreign policy – which is still to be defined – cannot be apportioned according to each Member State’s areas of interest and influence, but should take on a European dimension.

 Agriculture plays a key role in the development of communities. Defining its output as a primary sector in economic terms relates not only to the historical trend of its development, but also, and above all, to its role in stabilising societies and their economies. Balanced agricultural production has to be attentive not only to the quantities produced, but also, and primarily, to the quality of the output, so that it assists in the healthy development of the population. From this perspective, therefore, food security plays a key role, and its protection – particularly in terms of traditional and local produce – increases the opportunities for development throughout the territory. The positive correlation between food security and the quality and healthiness of agricultural products also involves increasing their eco-friendliness, while particular care must be paid to the domino effect caused by the uncontrolled introduction of genetically modified organisms, in order to provide, in the first instance, the necessary certainties as regards the medium- and long-term effects that these products could have on health and local economies.

Greater courage in formulating proposals for the efficient use of EU resources that make it possible to achieve binding objectives and concrete benchmarks; 4. effective and incisive EU governance of the economy and finance, as well as financial participation of employees in the success of the company that allow more widespread, balanced and inclusive economic and social development.

 The Stockholm Programme is an essential next step in the development of the European area of freedom, security and justice towards a greater focus on individuals. A greater focus that contributes not only to a more comprehensive perspective on citizenship, including respect for human beings and human dignity, but also to a perspective on the law and on justice that makes it accessible throughout the Union, so that individuals can exert their rights without any internal borders. A focus on individuals that must be guaranteed across the board, including as regards the growing phenomenon of immigration and asylum, albeit in strict compliance with the rules on civil harmony, including security. The Commission Action Plan is a consistent embodiment of the Stockholm Programme. When developing European areas of freedom, security and justice, however, respect must always be shown for the principle of subsidiarity, which encourages respect for individuals and for the traditions that form an integral part of their history.

 The ongoing economic and financial crisis, in severely affecting the economies of the ‘developed’ countries of the West, has shown that the economic paradigm of the efficiency and capacity for self-regulation of the markets is no longer based on reality, because reality has called for all economic and market players, especially financial market players, to act responsibly and ethically, something which they have completely failed to do in recent times. The disruption caused in financial terms to the entire economy shows that the industrial sector requires a huge amount of support, since it is still a sector of fundamental importance for the economy, especially the real economy. When taking into account the competitive and comparative advantages and disadvantages between regions, especially at international level, we must not forget that the mining industry is present in areas in which the development of sound economic and occupational alternatives should be encouraged as a preliminary step and in which welfare support provisions should be enhanced to prevent painful increases in unemployed workers whom it is difficult to redeploy.

The role of rural development is essential to keep our territories alive, both because of its end product and because it is so widespread. Seen in this context, the livestock sector is one of the most significant for our communities. Indeed, beyond food and economic aspects (though important, and in which regard the quality of the products is ensured by environmentally sustainable techniques), farming represents the most widespread form of occupation, protection and development of rural areas. This is why the European Union – including through the common agricultural policy, above all, in its post-2013, reformed incarnation – and each Member State must promote its continued existence, not only by coming up with innovative techniques for farming and economically and environmentally sustainable management, but also by strengthening their wider role as guardians of the environment and the land protecting them from the market crisis by reducing production costs, making the best of their products and greater organisation on the market.

Justice in relations between generations represents the new global challenge that needs to be adequately tackled. Modern societies have found themselves presiding over a period of constant growth in which, above all in the last few decades, new generations have had better conditions and prospects ahead of them than previous generations. Now, the situation has surpassed the limits of seemingly endless growth and we find ourselves faced with a debate between rights and limited resources. All countries, beginning with the developed and democratic ones and their related organisations (like the EU), must therefore work determinedly, conclusively and cogently to work out policies, make choices and implement them coherently for a greater equilibrium between current and future generations, so that the division and distance between those with rights and those without, and those with resources and those without, may be reduced.

The vote for a legislative motion for a resolution amending Directive 92/85/EEC was taken not only to support new and better measures for the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding but also, more generally, to support new measures to promote a better work-life balance. Even though the Italian legal system is more innovative, the increase in the number of weeks of maternity leave at European level represents a strong boost in favour of family assistance to newborn babies. The support for paternity leave is also a step in the same direction even though making this compulsory is not perhaps the best way to pursue the laudable aim of ensuring the greater effective presence of both parents at the most demanding time for the new household and ensuring the father is more aware and involved. Support for and extension of the rights of adopted children allows a reinforcement and, it is to be hoped, also a simplification of the adoption process.

 Late payments in commercial transactions between undertakings, and between undertakings and public authorities, are one of the things currently hampering the recovery of economic growth. Approval of the new directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions represents a major innovation that will require appropriate preparation, above all, of the public sector, in both political and administrative terms. In political terms, so that financial and budgetary planning can take account not only of the impact of European Union rules on the Stability and Growth Pact, but now also of the impact of the new rules on late payments, which, if not satisfactorily managed, could have both a direct and reflex effect on the room for manoeuvre of governments at various levels. In administrative terms, appropriate preparation is required for the correct financial management of public bodies, beginning with the ratio between liabilities and expenditure, so that tax revenues and, hence, the people, are not weighed down by burdens such as interest payments which could have a significant effect on public finances. Finally, it seems important for there to be particular awareness and flexibility regarding several sectors, such as the health sector, in which the public authorities have run up significantly late payments owed to undertakings, for regular goods and services provided.

 In the vote on the report by Mrs Gallo on the enforcement of intellectual property rights in the internal market, two mutually complementary rights have been reconciled. One is the particular intellectual property right of the author and/or editor of the item created, and the other is the more general right to knowledge of the users of the item itself. The European Union cannot only be an internal market, where businesses operate and protect the goods and services they provide, but it is also a shared space of citizenship and freedom, in which citizens can express and inform themselves and each other. Making everything bow to private interests, creating excessive, unjustified and unfair limits to the free dissemination of the creations of the intellect could unduly compromise the shared space, where the expression of thought takes on the significance of a public asset. Hence, it is important that intellectual creations are protected, but it is just as important that the methods of their protection are not excessive in order to make them fully available, as easily and quickly as reasonably possible, to the entire community, beginning with the Internet community.

While, on the one hand, it is important to achieve an internal market where all citizens and all enterprises can make the best possible choices, on the other hand, we must take into account the extraordinary heritage of food, wine and gastronomic culture that moulds the traditions of many parts of Europe, thus benefiting health and also economic, social and environmental sustainability. During the process of amending the proposal, both in detail and in broad terms, it has become apparent that the European Parliament, in performing this function so fundamental to the exercising of its responsibilities, is turning into a place where the interest of multinationals are transacted to the detriment of consumers. When faced by this inequality of power, which should be balanced out by the pursuit of public interest by the institution, we can only marvel at the growing public disinterest in the process of European integration. These observations are not motivated by national interests but by the judiciousness of preserving typical local food products and the strong local bond between producers and consumers.Carlo Casini,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution that we will vote on contains three points, as the Commissioner has underlined. The first deals with bringing forward the date of the elections: the proposal is aimed at ensuring that the Commission will be in a position to start work at the end of the summer. We must verify whether this is feasible – as the Commissioner has pointed out – to ensure that the date chosen will affect turnout positively rather than negatively. I believe that the most important proposal, however, is for nominations by the political parties of candidates for the Commission Presidency, and I prefer to speak of ‘political parties’ here rather than ‘political families’, precisely in order to underline the need for the creation of genuine European political parties. This is very important if Europe is to capture the imagination of the European electorate. The declining turnout is due also to the fact that during the European elections various national rather than European matters are discussed. The European elections are seen as nothing more than a test of the domestic political situation. During the election campaign we must talk about Europe, and the citizens must be firmly convinced that their votes count for something in terms of European policies. I think that nominating candidates for the Commission Presidency would help to convince the citizens of this. Europe will certainly be discussed more than in the past in these upcoming elections, because the economic crisis has focused attention on the basic debate of whether there should be more Europe, less Europe or even an end to Europe. It is absolutely essential to give citizens the opportunity to choose the government of Europe and the President of the Commission. The third question has to do with the make-up of the Commission, apart from the question of gender balance: we are debating whether it might not be better for a quota of future Commissioners, established in numerical terms or in some less determined manner, to be drawn from among MEPs. This would also give the electorate the feeling that their vote makes a difference. For these reasons, I think that we should support the resolution. Carlo Casini  (PPE
),

 The continued insistence on calling for European documents against homophobia demonstrates that the true objective is different from the apparent one. The principle of equality of all human beings, their dignity and the consequent need to respect everyone’s freedom regardless of their sexual orientation is an accepted fact, on which all parliamentarians agree. It is reasonable, therefore, to suppose, as indeed is clear from the resolution in question, that the objective pursued by the emphatic rejection of homophobia is to make same-sex marriage acceptable. It is implicit in the text that there is an aspiration to educate children to consider a same-sex relationship as having the same value as marriage, as the foundation of the family and therefore of the state, as recognised by Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We must not confuse the duty to guarantee freedom for all citizens with the state’s promotion of and support for what constitutes its foundation. On this point, educational and cultural aspects play a fundamental role and we must therefore oppose a misguided line of action that will result in public harm. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Article 6 should be implemented and it should be implemented soon, because it is a legal obligation that is required of us. The committee that I am honoured to chair has worked quickly and I would like to thank Mr Guerrero Salom and my fellow Members who worked on this. A contact group has also been set up between the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly and Parliament and I think this link should be reprised once again. We now call upon Mr Bødskov and Mr Kallas to pick up the pace and come to conclusions. I will not hide the problems, which are not structural – since you might say that we have already resolved those – but certainly substantial and procedural. They, however, can only be resolved in practice, once the Union has acceded to the Convention. In terms of the substance, there is one particular issue. As far as I know, this is the only case in the world in which a declaration, a legally binding act on human rights, applies to a territory where there is another legal act – the Convention of the Council of Europe – which contains the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This certainly poses a few problems, especially in procedural terms: who will have the last word? That is the major problem, but we cannot resolve it now. Meanwhile, let us get on with accession. The solution will emerge from case law, probably using the principle that the European Court of Human Rights applies, whereby all other remedies must already have been attempted before recourse may be made to the Court. In this sense, the European Court of Human Rights could be the court of last instance, even after the Court of Justice of the European Union.

Equality between women and men is an undeniable achievement of the modern era. Its foundations are equal human dignity and universal recognition of human rights. Unfortunately, in the report we are discussing today, there is an unacceptable contradiction that radically changes its meaning. Human dignity and human rights concern all human beings and therefore also the most fragile, weak and poor. Demanding abortion as a woman’s right, hiding this request in a misleading fashion in a question on sexual and reproductive rights (which in itself is worthy of full consent, provided that they do not include the right to destroy the life of an unwanted child) is unacceptable. For this reason I cannot vote in favour of the report. I would like to add that equality between men and women does not mean having the same identity and that motherhood is the sign of a capacity for receptivity (what may be called ‘feminine genius’) that man does not have. In that sense, women can walk at the head of all humanity towards goals of freedom, justice, peace and solidarity. But, to be themselves, they must not walk alone, but rather accompany all the weakest people on Earth, starting off from their own children. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not able to go into detail about the three issues raised by the Commission. I believe that these issues should be seriously looked into. However, I am sure that there has been lengthy discussion on the matter by my Committee on Constitutional Affairs, when the constitution had not yet been approved and there was already criticism of it, for reasons that people are too afraid to voice. Firstly, because there is the reference …  (The President cut off the speaker) Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Many of the speeches in our long debate have been rather generic. It has not been clearly shown which provisions of the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights have been violated by Hungary, or which precise provision of Hungarian law should be censured. Only the Commission has indicated three more precise areas for investigation. I believe that in this regard we need to have faith in the Commission and in the Hungarian Government and Parliament. However, there is an underlying issue that needs to be brought to light. Attacks continue to be made on the Hungarian Constitution, but no one has the courage to indicate the real reasons why a certain European radical left-wing is supporting a campaign of denigration against a country which has great merit in the fight for democracy and freedom. What is disturbing about the Hungarian Constitution is the reference to Christian roots, recognition of human dignity from the moment of conception, and statement that the family is a natural state based on marriage between a man and a woman. I do not believe that these three aspects conflict with European values. In fact they are an exemplary description of the foundations of such values, which should be taken as a model by all of European law. Carlo Casini,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to thank all those who worked on this text, starting with the working group, in which all the leading members of the parties present in this House met, but also my committee, which did some valuable work on this issue. I believe that we need a very broad consensus to demonstrate that this Parliament is a transparent parliament, that it is concerned only with the common good, and that each one of us is personally honouring the commitment, made back at the time of the elections, to serve only the common good and European integration. Hence, I believe that there should be a very broad consensus, which is why I would ask Mr Gargani to withdraw his oral amendments; although they are worded very well, they would prevent this broad consensus from being reached. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the people are the foundation of democracy. ‘People’ means identity, a combination of history, traditions and ideals, but it also means unity and the desire to have a single government. On that basis, a single electoral system is clearly an instrument for building a population, a European demos
. This European demos
 still does not fully exist, as demonstrated by the fact that in the last European elections there was a much lower turnout and hence a lack of responsiveness, and by the fact that national debates have focused primarily on national problems and not on European problems. The proposals made in the Treaty of Lisbon should therefore be implemented. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament is not obliged to present or draft a uniform electoral law; the Treaty merely indicates that it has the power to do so, but it is an extraordinarily important power, and therefore we must not abandon our plan to undertake this reform of the 1976 Act. We will refer this document by Mr Duff – whom I thank once again in my capacity as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs – back to committee. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs adopted his text almost unanimously, and we are somewhat reluctant today to see it be referred back to committee. However, precisely because we must not back down in any way, I believe that Parliament should redraft the text so that it is more workable and can receive broader support, but that referral back to committee should not be a way of shelving the reform. The need for a European vision is not due solely to the fact that elections could be held in a transnational college; there is also the question of what the direct election by the people of the Members of the Commission or at least of the Commission President would involve. It is with that question that I shall therefore conclude my speech, extending my thanks once again to the rapporteur, Mr Duff. Carlo Casini  (PPE
).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Prime Minister, I share in the thanks already expressed by others, though I am not going to specify the individual points that justify this gratitude. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO), which I chair, has had the chance to meet you on a number of occasions, including in your own country. We first met you as a delegation and then within the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs; we have witnessed the constant, unambiguous and pro-European commitment of the Hungarian Presidency. The AFCO would like to thank you in particular for your contribution this semester to concluding the report on the citizens’ initiative. Likewise, thank you for the statements that Mrs Győri made here just recently as she took on the commitment, on behalf of the Council, to adhere to the transparency register as soon as possible. The Polish Presidency can hardly fail to follow suit. Hungary chose ‘Stronger Europe’ as its slogan and I sincerely believe that this was well-chosen. You have succeeded in riding out a storm that was made even more intense by the criticisms levelled by Parliament. I must say, as a constitutional scholar – indeed, I have written a book on all the constitutions in Europe – that it is unheard of to try and criticise the constitution of a Member State for reasons of domestic policy. It is also unprecedented to say that a constitution is incompatible with European principles because it refers to human and family values, which are precisely the values of the European tradition and the very building blocks of Europe. I therefore thank you not only for the strong and courageous work of your Presidency, but also for the Constitution of Hungary. Carlo Casini,  
rapporteur

Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will make a single statement covering both matters, which are on the same subject. With this debate and the vote which will follow, we will conclude a task and a period of negotiations in the working group chaired by Mrs Wallis and composed of fellow Members from all political groups, as well as a Commission delegation led by Mr Šefčovič, which has resulted in the drafting of an agreement for the establishment of a common Transparency Register. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) has prepared this report in a few months and has also finalised a report on the amendment of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. Personally, I was very surprised at the amount of public attention that this transparency agreement has garnered. I fear that people think the results will have a greater effect than was actually pursued. Transparency is the defence of right political action, but it is not the right instrument for getting to the heart of corruption. The recent cases of journalists trying to corrupt a few MEPs could also happen outside parliamentary premises. Furthermore, would-be corruptors know how to avoid being identified and the registers are not, therefore, a silver bullet. The right tool for the job is criminal law. Yet if the criminal law of the Member States is not sufficient, we will need to reread Articles 82 to 86 of the Treaty of Lisbon, reflect on whether we can consider the corruption of MEPs to be cross-border crime or an act otherwise detrimental to the Union’s financial interests and determine whether or not to create a European Public Prosecutor, which would, moreover, be a significant step along the path to unity. The Transparency Register has a more modest task. In some countries the term lobbyist has a negative meaning, while in others lobbying is seen as an almost an act of public service because it informs decision-makers on issues they might not otherwise know about. This is especially important for the European Parliament, because often the issues faced by MEPs are very complex and technical and we almost always need to find a balance between businesses and countries with divergent interests. This is where lobbyists become very useful. So we shall no longer call them lobbyists but stakeholders. Of course, interests can be conflicting, and rightly so. I used to be a judge and I can say that cross-examination of opposing sides is considered a condition for uncovering the truth and obtaining justice. So, having lobbyists or stakeholders with conflicting interests is a good thing: what is important is that the judge – and therefore also the MEP – maintains his freedom of thought, independence, and his honest search for the common good. Hence, we have established the Transparency Register, in mutual agreement between Parliament and the Commission with the hope that the Council will soon join the agreement. Those who wish to represent their interests are free to have access to our premises but they must be listed in the Register, where all information needed to identify their legal and financial status will be recorded. The Register is public. There are also organisations that do not pursue selfish interests but try to collaborate in European policies in the name of general values, such as churches, political parties and regions. They do not need to be added to this Register: but, if they have separate offices exclusively tasked with maintaining contact with European institutions, they must be included in their Register, though subject to a different legal regime to stakeholders. As already stated, the new Register also contains an amendment to the Rules of Procedure. There are therefore two reports, but in any case this is just a first step towards more complete transparency. Some hypotheses are already being researched and could be turned into rules after further reflection hence point 9 of the document adopting the agreement indicates the possibility for the reports to carry the details of the stakeholders who met with MEPs during the preparation of the report in question. This broad provision for possible amendments leads me to express a negative opinion on amendments which would put limits on such future deliberations. I hope, however, that Council will join this agreement in short order and that there is also immediate and broad consensus in this House, a strong signal of the duty of transparency and also a call to action. I hope that the vote is nearly unanimous. Carlo Casini,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to clarify a few things. I too would like to strongly emphasise that this agreement was concluded long before the outbreak of the episode with the British journalists. Unfortunately, this is one way in which false information is spread through the media. For example, a major Italian newspaper, the Corriere della Sera
, has today poked fun at Europe by saying that we acted too late and only after these events with journalists. This is not true. It unjustly encourages distrust of Europe. The agreement had been reached long beforehand. If anything, this discussion has arisen with some delay because, once the scandal had exploded, we wondered if we could attempt to further strenthen the agreement. The text has, however, remained the unchanged. That is the first clarification. The second concerns the question of obligation. The register is already mandatory. Those who want to lobby must enrol themselves in the register. I cannot understand what ‘obligatory’ means: it cannot mean that all companies, all enterprises or all citizens must be entered in this register. That is not possible. If anything, it is up to individual MEPs, who, when approached by someone who wants to exert pressure on them, must invite them to register before making contact. The third point refers to possible future amendments. There is a working group for this purpose, which I think needs to have as much room for manoeuvre as possible. I agree that we should identify the lobbyists encountered during the course of the negotiations but I do not know if this task belongs only to the rapporteur or whether it should be extended to the President. We grant the working group the freedom to submit any necessary recommendations. Finally, I too wish to thank both Mr Šefčovič, who has made a huge contribution to the implementation of this agreement, and the representative of the Hungarian Government, for, among other things, the assurance given about the Council joining the agreement in short order, which without doubt has its own uncertainties seeing as the Council certainly represents the second chamber in this case. If the Council is also equipped with the register, this would therefore underline more effectively that the structure of Europe is made up of a government – the Commission – and a legislative body, consisting both of representatives of citizens and of states. Howver, I realise that there are still questions to be answered, since the Council of Ministers represents the states. I am, however, confident that we will come to a positive conclusion.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Giannakou, since she has carried out a great and intelligent piece of work. When we talk about political parties, we must take two problems into consideration. Firstly, parties are not much esteemed in any country. Secondly, when European elections take place, political parties are generally considered to pursue the interests of their national state and not the interests of Europe as a whole. At the level of public opinion, there is therefore a lack of positive esteem either for the parties or for their function in relation to the forging of Europe. We must therefore act urgently. Not only in the Treaty of Lisbon, as has already been noted, but in many constitutions, in almost all European constitutions, the function of the parties is considered to be of national interest, and thus crucial in the creation of democracy and the pursuit of common interests. It is important to stress that I am speaking about constitutions, and not ordinary laws, and that thus I am referring to the fundamental structures of the States and the European Union as a whole. It is thus pressing that we define a statute for parties that are truly European-facing, and not only an algebraic sum of individual national formations that have no permanent European structure on the ground. We need to see parties that think and act in a European context instead. The need I am describing is much more pressing if we really do want to see a uniform European electoral law which, hopefully, could even lead to a single European constituency to sit alongside the national constituencies. This will increase the individual European citizen’s sense of belonging to Europe. I come now to the core of my argument. As has already been emphasised – and I thank the Commissioner in advance – my committee has worked very hard, holding hearings and many meetings, but we need a proposal, an initiative from the European Commission, which brings together European parties within the law of the Union with a new legal form under public law, with a legal personality that is also valid in all Member States and with a uniform structure that allows them to act as representatives of the European public interest. I thank Mrs Giannakou and the Commissioner for their pledges. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everything is uncertain as regards the situation in North Africa. We do not know the immediate outcome of the civil war in Libya, we do not know whether the new political order in the Maghreb countries and Egypt will be conducive to democracy, or whether even worse conditions will arise with regard to democracy and relations with Europe. As for the arrival of an unstoppable stream of fugitives from the shores of Africa onto European shores and those of Lampedusa in particular, it is difficult, even in this case, to distinguish those who are fleeing from violence and fear of death, those who have, for example, escaped from prison, and those who are looking for a future that holds better things than the hunger in their country. We can nevertheless be sure of certain things. Firstly, human dignity must be respected in all human beings. Secondly, the European approach is to offer hospitality to all refugees. Thirdly, the borders of the individual states which form part of the European Union are the borders of Europe. Fourthly, there is a duty of solidarity among all European countries that are part of the Union: this was confirmed, strengthened and made legally binding by the Treaty of Lisbon, which also governs migration policy and the management of migratory flows in an area of freedom, security and justice. Fifthly, the instruments for coping with emergencies such as the current one are already in place, in the form of Directive 2001/55/EC, Frontex and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). The current situation is one of those situations that reveals whether Europe actually is or is not a reality. Commissioner, I greatly enjoyed your speech, but I think we should move from words to deeds. I am well aware of this and I know you will act. We hope that your proposal will be followed up. The important thing is that words are not enough: we need deeds to make Europe a reality. This is an opportunity to build Europe. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the strange thing about the Council’s proposal is that once it has been approved, it will pave the way for the creation of a permanent stability mechanism through an instrument of international law, and hence without a direct link to the institutional structure of the Union. This fact caused great concern in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which I chair, and which has the task of keeping an eye on the coherence of the Union's institutional framework. The simplified revision proposal therefore sparked a lively debate in which arguments based on the solid principles of the process of European integration came up against pragmatism and realpolitik
. In short, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs thinks that in order to deliberate on the proposal to amend the treaty, Parliament must assess the economic governance context under which the proposal falls. We need to know more about how the future mechanism will tie in with existing institutional structures. It would be a mistake to create twin structures which, in the long term, would carry the risk of the Union breaking up. The proposals and suggestions in the report by Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri aim to build suitable bridges between the Union’s institutional structure and the new mechanism. Moreover, I should like to emphasise that the Council must see these issues as fundamental for harmonious cooperation between the European institutions. I therefore strongly urge the European Council to take heed of this requirement and the consideration that it must give us, ahead of our vote on 24 March. As we await a positive sign, I should like to offer my heartfelt thanks for the brilliant work of the rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Hungarian Government has shown great sensitivity towards Europe and towards the principles upon which it is based in this affair. In fact, immediately after the approval of the Hungarian media law, a campaign was waged by the left, which used the phrase ‘gagging law’. In reality, only those who have experienced communism, fascism and Nazism know what a gagging law is, while democratic states know that freedom and pluralism of information are part and parcel of democracy. However, they should be harmonised with all other powers of the rule of law and must not harm, in particular, the foundation of democracy, which is human dignity. For example, Article 21 of the Italian Constitution does in fact guarantee freedom of information, but it also directly prohibits publications that are contrary to public morality. The 1948 law on the freedom of the press in Italy, which no one has ever challenged, lays down an obligation not for authorisation but for registration of any publication, as does the Hungarian law. The reservations that the European Commission itself has rightly expressed do not devalue the stated aim of the Hungarian law, and that aim of ensuring respect for human dignity is demonstrated precisely by the attitude that the Hungarian Government has taken by opening itself up immediately to the acceptance of criticism and taking responsibility for changing the law according to the guidelines provided to it. The statement that the fundamental rights of the European Union will be written into the Hungarian Constitution is also proof of Hungary’s fundamental desire to be part of European culture. In conclusion, I no longer understand the point of this discussion, except to ‘blame’ Hungary for having supported its government and parliament democratically by a two-thirds majority. Yet this gives Europe reason for hope, not reason for criticism. I am therefore grateful to the Commission and to the Hungarian Government. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Members who have already spoken have said practically everything. They have recalled the facts, assessed them and made specific requests. Therefore, as this is the last speech scheduled, I should like to add something that has not yet been said, and what comes to mind are the thoughts of a very great European, John Paul II, a man who very effectively helped to bring down the Berlin Wall. In his spiritual testament, he mentions the four values that underpin our future civilisation, that is to say, the civilisation of love: they are life, peace, bread and religious freedom. Then I think of everything that has been written by Giorgio La Pira, the former Mayor of Florence, who promoted large conferences on Christian civilisation at the height of the cold war. In his book Premesse della politica
 (‘Premises of politics’), he wrote that every political idea has a particular concept of man underlying it. For Christian Europe, he writes, man is essentially a praying being, that is to say, a being able to enter a dialogue, to conceive of the infinite and to talk to God. Taking away a man’s ability to take part in private and public dialogue is not only a negation of religion, but also a negation of man himself. I leave these thoughts with the House and with you, High Representative, as a contribution towards a concrete and effective commitment by our European Union, which is rooted in its Christian identity and never fails to proclaim its purpose of defending and promoting human dignity and human rights. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment aims to make our judgment on Egypt’s actions more incisive. It is not only a matter of acknowledging that Egypt has at least done something, but asking it to intervene quickly and immediately to free these hostages, urging the country never to use lethal force to repel people crossing the Sinai. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is also called upon to make immediate contact with the people currently being held hostage. ‘urges the Egyptian authorities to take all necessary measures to secure the release of Eritreans held hostage, to avoid the use of lethal force against illegal immigrants crossing the borders of the country, to protect their dignity and their physical and psychological integrity and to guarantee that detained migrants have the opportunity to contact the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and that the High Commissioner has access to all asylum seekers and refugees in custody’. Carlo Casini  (PPE
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, I should like to ask the proposer of the amendment to clarify an issue. According to the text read out, the requested intervention concerns all those who request the right of asylum. I should rather say ‘those who have the right of asylum’, because ‘who request’ is too dangerous, as there is the risk that anyone can request the right of asylum. Vice-versa, by coordinating this amendment with the intervention of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, it will be the latter that will assess this. In any case, I should ask the proposer to modify the amendment with the words ‘those who have the right of asylum’. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I am speaking above all to thank all the members of my committee for their good work, particularly Mr Lamassoure and Mrs Gurmai, who did a great job in achieving the aim of implementing one of the most important changes in the Treaty of Lisbon. The committee also listened to the opinion of all national parliaments and experts, working in close contact with the Commission – for which I offer my heartfelt thanks to Commissioner Šefčovič – and with the Council’s willingness to engage in dialogue, for which I should like to thank Mr Chastel. Applying Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure also worked very well, allowing us to work effectively with the Committee on Petitions. I personally supported the need for an annual deadline for the entry into force of the regulation and this was certainly not to delay its application but, quite the contrary, to ensure that its initial implementation will be carried out comprehensively and conscientiously so that all Member States, without exception, are able to fulfil the requirement to prepare participation and checking instruments. I believe that the greatest positive effect of the new scheme is to increase the awareness of EU citizenship, which has now been enriched by the power of participation in the legislative process, including providing the stimulus. I am also certain that the mechanisms provided will guarantee easy participation for citizens, while also preventing abuse. Ultimately, I believe that, with the Christmas festivities only a few days away, the adoption of this regulation represents a nice gift for European citizens and Europe itself. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 I abstained from the final vote on the Berlinguer resolution because Amendment 2 was thrown out. This was extremely important for ruling out possible erroneous interpretations of item 40, which states that Parliament ‘strongly supports plans to enable the mutual recognition of the effects of civil status documents’. The expression could suggest, for example, a European Union-wide obligation to recognise a union between people of the same sex registered in a Member State where such a union is permitted. In actual fact, we must distinguish between the effects of a completed legal action (in the case of marriage) and the effects of an official registration document. The latter bears full witness to what is documented (for example, that a homosexual marriage has been entered into in Holland) and this public witness is the effect of the official marital status document. However, the effects of the official registration document are something different and their recognition (for example, a survivor’s pension) is not permitted in a State that does not recognise them. Matters of family law are, in any case, part of the identity of individual states and cannot be touched by EU law. The possibility of a different interpretation led me to choose to abstain.

 I voted for Mrs Weber’s motion for a resolution on the Roma in Europe because of its balanced, constructive content. It is not enough to shout against discrimination, perhaps exploiting real and extremely serious problems for the purposes of party-political wrangling. Naturally, we need to firmly reassert the principles of non-discrimination, of free movement and the resulting rights and obligations – as does the resolution by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – but more important still is to undertake practical reforms to solve the problems, in order to implement fundamental human rights. Immigration is a European issue and the time has come, as called for by Mrs Weber’s resolution, to tackle it at European level. The Roma issue only partly overlaps with the issue of integration, and in any case it has specific features which must also be addressed at European level. The structure of the EU was designed on the premise of the territorial stability of the member peoples. A nomadic lifestyle may be a characteristic of a people, which must also be respected, but inclusion must come about in a spirit of solidarity, in accordance with European rules, without the individual Member States playing it by ear. This is the resolution’s proposal which won our support. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Freedom of the media is beyond discussion, and no one in any democratic system can dispute the need for the media to be independent and pluralistic. In an information society such as ours, however, it is becoming increasingly evident that independence does not mean the absence of any rules and that pluralism is not a sufficient value. The power of the media in an information society is really a public power which Montesquieu, were he alive today, would have tried to balance against the other powers: legislative, executive and judicial. These three traditional powers must also be independent, but a reciprocal limit is established between them. As far as I can see, this problem has not been examined in depth. I will restrict myself to making two remarks. Journalists’ right to freedom is a human right that is at least equal to the right to dignity and privacy of every citizen. A duty of checks and balances therefore also exists. Judicial power must be transparent, but certain investigations must be absolutely secret during the initial stages if the truth is to be uncovered in the interests of justice and, therefore, ultimately of the public. I believe that these two aspects are always neglected in our debates. By making this speech, I have attempted to leave some record of them. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Once again we have the regrettable situation in which arguments proposing unjust solutions to the issue of the right to life are being applied to the discussion of a real and serious problem (in this case the fight against HIV), thus making it impossible to vote in favour. The use of the words ‘sexual and reproductive health’ has now become the means by which to convince parliaments to promote abortion. We must not let ourselves be deceived. Everyone, including myself, for a start, must promote sexual and reproductive health, but when the words indicate a different and, in fact, opposite state of affairs (whereby killing a human being is understood as a woman’s right to freedom), it then becomes necessary to expose the deceit. Abortion in the world is a real tragedy, but it is a real tragedy in our Europe too! My intention in voting against the resolution is not to hinder the wide-ranging efforts to combat AIDS, but to oppose the method and the content that I mentioned. Carlo Casini  (PPE
),

 I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their continued, determined and intelligent work. The committee which I chair, given the evident and sensitive institutional implications resulting from the creation of the new Service, has followed the preparation of the text of the agreement extremely closely since the very beginning. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs not only participated in the work of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, under the very strict definition of cooperation laid down in Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure, but it also selected both of the rapporteurs. I am certain that Parliament will approve the document by a large majority. There will be work to do in order to make the European External Action Service (EEAS) able to actually perform the role it has been given by the new treaty and by the enthusiasm of the rapporteurs. The Service is not only a way to increase the European Union’s presence in various nations throughout the world; it also has a very important symbolic value, which is to express the unity of the 27 Member States. It is a natural consequence of the recognition of the EU’s legal personality. It is an incredibly important step towards the goal to be reached. The more votes cast in its favour, the further that step will carry us. I hope it will be reinforced even further by the establishment of a European Diplomatic Academy, and I would like to nominate the prestigious European University Institute in Florence to develop it.

),

It is very sad that for years now, the European Parliament has been unable to resolve a tragic contradiction. In every document in which measures to combat poverty, hunger and violence in the world are admirably proposed, some manage to include the declaration, whether direct or indirect, of the so-called right to abortion as a vehicle for the health and development of populations. The initiative of some is met, on the one hand, with the virtual indifference of the majority and, on the other, with a certain diffidence of the minority. Yet the contradiction and the tragedy are obvious. The principle of equal dignity for all human beings and that of special, rightful solidarity towards the youngest members of society are being abandoned at the very time when we are supposed to be pursuing the objective of combating discrimination and protecting health. This has also happened today in the case of the Cashman report, paragraph 42 of which, in contradicting the entire document, has forced myself and a number of MEPs to ultimately reject the report as a whole. When balanced against one another, in fact, the bad points that are being promoted unfortunately outweigh the good points present in other parts of the text. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Madam President, Mr López Garrido, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this membership is surely a sign of one of the European Union’s missions: the mission to defend and promote human rights. A mission that is already fully formulated and borne out by history, by the fact that individual Member States already belong to the European Council convention, by the reiteration that the general principles of the convention and Member States’ constitutions are now part of European law. So this symbolic gesture is extremely important. However, translating this ideal concept into substantive legal rules is not so simple: this report refers chiefly and ultimately only to institutional questions, and is completely acceptable. I must say that I also thank Mr Atondo, and am bound to report that the AFCO Committee on Constitutional Affairs – which I chair - has approved this document almost unanimously. We are therefore satisfied with this document, and I will not dwell on individual elements of it, because we fully support everything that the President of the Council and the Commissioner have said. I would like to make just one suggestion, since the statement about the institutional presence of European Members of Parliament within the European Council Parliamentary Assembly when meeting to appoint the judge and the judges is somewhat vague: I would say that there is a small problem with the relationship between the population of Europe, of the European Union, and the populations of other countries. Luckily, the regulation governing membership and representation in the European Council Parliamentary Assembly already states that there can be no fewer than two per State, and no more than 18 altogether. Given the importance of the European Union, I suggest that we should draw the line at 18. I must conclude, however, and so I will finish by saying that this resolution exposes a problem that it is worth examining in more depth, in other words, the problem that we have already highlighted many times of the relationship between the Courts. I believe we must reflect a little more upon this problem but, above all, on the problem of the European spirit: we are the European Union and, as stated in Article 2 of the Treaty of Lisbon, we are founded on human dignity and human rights – and equality is founded on human dignity. In Europe, we are not united on this point, and so we must reflect carefully on this concept of human dignity, its limits and what it covers. That is not the subject of this decision and this very welcome report, however. I thank the rapporteur. Carlo Casini  (PPE

I have cast my vote, which is categorically in favour of the two reports drafted by Mr Méndez de Vigo. I am satisfied for two reasons: the committee that I chair acted promptly, reaching a provisional agreement, and that agreement paved the way for the one reached today in plenary by a very large majority. From this perspective, I have endorsed the idea of voting against paragraph 5, introduced by an amendment of mine tabled in committee, to emphasise that the appointment of the 18 new Members will have to comply as far as possible with the provisions of the 1976 Electoral Act, which requires that Members be elected directly by the European citizens. Therefore, the preference will have to be for an automatic method that allows the candidates who received the most votes of those who were not elected during the last European elections to join Parliament. If, however, the national electoral system does not allow for such a calculation, we can resort to appointment by the national parliaments. Carlo Casini,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be very brief since the committee I chair reached a very comprehensive agreement, in line with what has already been said, and so there is no need to make the debate too long-winded. The problem which arose and was discussed in committee mainly concerned the following: both the Electoral Act of 1976 and the Treaty of Lisbon require Members of this Parliament to be directly elected by the peoples of the various nations. This is a problem for cases in which the electoral system used to elect MEPs for this parliamentary term does not allow entry into Parliament of candidates who did not obtain enough votes to secure a seat, but did obtain enough votes to allow their entry at a later date. Some electoral systems do allow this, but it appears that others do not. Therefore, if we do not wish to considerably delay the integration of the Members into Parliament, we should have recourse to exceptional, transitional appointment systems, as envisaged by the Council. Following lengthy discussions, my committee concluded that this is a fair position. We therefore support what has already been said. Indeed, I must say that I personally tabled an amendment proposing the appointment of observers for an interim period prior to the election of the new Members to this Parliament. Although this amendment is still under discussion, we shall have to vote against it – even if it is my amendment – since the compromise amendment provides for the swift, immediate integration of the MEPs into Parliament.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcomed the statements by Mr López Garrido and Mr Šefčovič. The new Treaty of Lisbon urges us to swiftly adopt a systematic course of action to promote the citizens’ initiative, which is testament to the existence of a European people. Indeed, it is a well-known fact that one of the harshest criticisms of the Union is that it is not a fully democratic structure. The Treaty of Lisbon has sought to reduce the democratic deficit in several ways, including by making provision for at least one million European citizens to submit a proposal for a legislative initiative. This new instrument, in order to be a serious tool, will have to produce legal effects of a certain importance. It certainly cannot have equivalent value to the pre-existing petitions which are signed by a wide range of individuals – a clear distinction must be made – and it must therefore be regulated in such a way as to prevent its abuse and still allow broad discussion, as the expression of informed and verifiable popular consensus. However, the most important aspect of the initiative laid down in Article 11 of the Treaty of Lisbon is its symbolic significance: the democratic deficit is being tackled not only by the decision-making power of the people’s representatives, but even more so by the very existence of a European people which is not just the mathematical sum of the citizens of the individual nations. Therefore, with regard to the rules we are considering, there are two aspects that I consider to be particularly important: the first concerns the subject matter, which must be – as someone already said – a European issue; the second is the distribution of the minimum number of signatories across a significant number of Member States, representing an appropriate percentage with respect to the electoral weight of each country. I hope that the new rules will help citizens of France, Italy, Germany, Spain and so on feel that they are, first and foremost, citizens of Europe. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 I voted against the resolution on equality between women and men in the European Union (2009), even though I agree with a great deal of its content, because we cannot call for equality for a certain category of people without denying it to another category of human beings. I refer to paragraph 38, which claims to guarantee women’s rights by ensuring them easy access to abortion. The destruction of the smallest and most defenceless individuals in the shape of unborn children cannot be considered a way of confirming women’s dignity and freedom. An anti-life conspiracy is at work, which uses tried and tested ways of deceiving us. We must reveal it for what it is. Putting together extremely fair requests with extremely unfair claims and twisting the meanings of words are stratagems that have proved effective during European Parliament votes, but I will have nothing to do with it. We cannot talk about the drama of abortion, which deserves the attention of politicians as well as moralists, without also recognising the rights of newborns or at least calling for proper education as far as respect for life is concerned and organising forms of support for difficult or unwanted pregnancies so that they can be allowed to reach their natural conclusions.

I should like to say how pleased I am, as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, about the agreement that has been reached on the principal lines of a new Framework Agreement between the Commission and Parliament. I must, however, make it clear that we need to think more deeply about the nature of the relationship between these two institutions. The outlook for democratic growth in the Union continues to be one in which Parliament is seen as representing the people and the Council as a sort of second chamber, representing the States. In such a context, the Commission should be considered as a government, and it is clear that this configuration would require rules that are considerably more detailed than the adjustments deservedly outlined today. I should like to add a thought on the citizens’ right of initiative. The relevant rules will have to be tailored to the effects that we consider must follow as a result. These effects must be considered in comparison with those stemming from the existing right of every citizen to submit a petition to the European Parliament and those connected to the limited powers of Parliament. Parliament has no power of initiative but it does have the power to request that the Commission initiate legislation. Carlo Casini  (PPE

With my emphatic vote in favour, I want to add greater force to the words spoken by President Barroso; words that gave notice of the construction over the next five years of a more united and stronger Europe. He began his speech by recalling the fundamental values of European unity, the most important of which is human dignity. I agree wholeheartedly, but the problem is that the word ‘dignity’ has become ambiguous, because it is used not only to guarantee life and human equality, but also to discriminate against and do harm to the most vulnerable members of society and even to justify death. I hope, therefore, that in the next five years, the Commission will work in such a way that the word ‘dignity’ will be restored to its unambiguous and true meaning. It is of symbolic importance that on 15 December last year, during the height of efforts to form the new Commission, 500 000 European citizens from 17 countries requested, in a collective petition, that our institutions interpret and implement the Charter of Fundamental Rights in every decision, on the basis of the equal dignity of every human being. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the principle of equality between women and men is part of the central current of the great river that has already freed foreigners, slaves, black people, and that is the principle of human dignity, the same for everyone. The Tarabella report and that of the Commission are therefore both commendable, because it is right to always insist thoroughly on this principle. There are, however, two critical remarks that I feel I should make. The flow of human dignity and equality should concern everyone, absolutely everyone, including those who are waiting to enter the world, unborn children. It is therefore unacceptable to do as point 38 of this report does, that is, to speak of abortion as an aspect of sexual reproductive rights, or women’s rights. No one is denying the complexity of problems where difficult and unwanted pregnancies are concerned – there are serious problems – but, in any case, these things should not be spoken about except in relation to the need to nurture respect for life and to offer mothers all kinds of help so that they can freely choose to continue with their pregnancy. My second criticism concerns the extension of the concept of sexual and reproductive health, as is done in recital X, beyond physical and mental aspects, to include social aspects as well. I wonder what it means that all sexual behaviour, whatever it may be, must receive from others justifications of wellbeing, and therefore recognition and praise. Does this not mean that we end up violating not only freedom of conscience, but also freedom of opinion? I will merely ask this question because I do not think it is a banal one. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in voting in favour of the joint resolution, I am highlighting the particular seriousness of the violence carried out in Malaysia in response to an exclusively nominalistic issue. Indeed, it is certain that both Christians and Muslims believe in only one God, who is the God of all men, believers and non-believers alike. The fact that He is referred to by different names is absolutely secondary. To claim that the Muslim God is only Muslim and can therefore be invoked only by Muslims, using a traditionally Muslim name, means returning to the ancestral and tribal view that there is a God for each group of human beings. In other words, it means contradicting the monotheistic idea that makes universal religions which, like Christianity and Islam, oppose idolatry and polytheism, great religions that are close to people. No less serious is the persecution of the Copts in Egypt. It was on the shores of the Mediterranean that monotheistic religions, which claim to be, and are, forces for promoting brotherhood and peace, were born. However, it is remarkable that it should be precisely on the shores of the Mediterranean, in Jerusalem – a holy city for those who believe in God, Allah and Jehovah – that the main breeding ground for conflict is found. It is precisely Egypt that is the most powerful country in the area, where Christians and Muslims must coexist peacefully in order to play a peacemaking role throughout the southern Mediterranean area.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for this Parliament, I am pleased that the Spanish Presidency attaches importance to the fulfilment of the structural reforms provided for by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in particular, with regard to the European External Action Service, to the Citizens’ Initiative, and to the European Union’s adherence to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, for which my committee has already appointed a rapporteur, the Spaniard, Mr Jáuregui Atondo, whom you already know. However, in an interview published in the Spanish newspaper, El País
, last Sunday, you expressed the wish, Mr Zapatero, that the law on religious freedom might result in Spain taking steps towards normalisation within all its public institutions. Thus, I would like, in this respect, to suggest that we reflect very briefly on the fact that Europe’s structures are a means of achieving an objective, and the European Union’s objective is confirmed in Article 2 of the Treaty of Lisbon: the promotion of dignity, equality, freedom and solidarity. I must therefore voice some concern about the direction in which this debate on values is heading. Cultural unity comes before economic unity. Europe’s spirit is stronger than the public – excuse me, judicial – structure. Europe’s spirit is rooted in the instinct for truth and beauty belonging to ancient Greece, in the cult of justice belonging to Rome, and on the basis of this extraordinarily great heritage it is Christianity that has added the value of human beings, always as equals from conception to natural death. Today, it is in the name of the Cross of Christ that we ask to go to Haiti, to be present in Haiti, because all human beings, and the poorest in particular, are at the heart of this. And so I ask you: what does ‘normalisation’ mean with regard to religious freedom? Does it mean perhaps preventing all citizens from publicly expressing their religion? Does it mean forgetting the roots, including the Christian roots, of our countries? Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the decision of the European Court of Human Rights has upset not only worshippers but also everyone who, for centuries, has viewed the crucifix as a sign of hope and solidarity, something providing solace and freedom from fear and pain. We hope that that decision will be modified by the Grand Chamber since it is clearly irrational. Should we do away with the very name of the Red Cross? Should we remove the huge crucifixes on mountain tops which tower over cities and valleys? Will it be prohibited for the Queen of England, as has already been mentioned, to be the head of the Anglican Church? Nevertheless, the case invites a very important reflection from a civil and political point of view: are human rights merely the rights of individuals, as parties isolated from a social environment, or is the right to express a specific form of piety also a right of the peoples? Do tradition, history, intelligence and art count for nothing when, for millennia, they have characterised a people’s identity? Furthermore, the question also rightly concerns the relationship between subsidiarity and human rights, and I note that the latter, aside from certain fundamental principles which must be considered universal and irrefutable, may be interpreted in different ways, and human rights may even conflict with each other. Why should a state be denied the chance, through its laws, to resolve these conflicts and to interpret and implement human rights according to the ethical views of its people? The issue therefore goes beyond the question of crucifixes. On other occasions, the European Court has recognised, with regard to the right to life, the exclusive power of the States to decide on the most controversial matters, such as the regulation of abortion and euthanasia. Now, the Treaty of Lisbon requires us to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights and consequently, as the European Union, also to respect the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights. Therefore, we ought to think about the new and different direction currently being taken by the Court. It would be a serious matter if a supranational power, especially if exercised by a limited number of people and not as the democratic expression of popular will, were to become repressive and demeaning, insensitive to people’s feelings and hearts and therefore ultimately opposed to freedom. This is why I hope that the resolution tabled by the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will be adopted with the votes of a large number of Members. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, the subject is an oral amendment to paragraph 131, on which I am in agreement with the other two rapporteurs, Mr López Aguilar and Mr Berlinguer. The current text states: ‘calls on the Council, the Commission and Member States to evaluate and review current international, European and national laws and policies on drugs and to promote harm reduction policies, notably with a view to the conferences on those issues held at UN level’. The oral amendment proposes inserting the words ‘prevention’ and ‘recovery’, meaning that the call to evaluate and review laws would concern ‘harm reduction, prevention and recovery policies’.

 Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution because it indicates the right way to strengthen European unity around the fundamental values that constitute its very identity. We cannot fool ourselves that it will be possible to achieve agreement on so-called common values. We may nevertheless hope that the application of reason can help the various political components to look more closely at what is right and fair where progressing along the road to European unity is concerned. The clear distinction between the right to free movement and the principle of non-discrimination, on the one hand, and the value of the family as a natural society founded on marriage, on the other, has led to the formulation of the paragraph that upholds the independence of individual States in family law and the ban on discrimination against any human being. Those who, like me, fully promote the principle of equality, affirming equality between children who are born and those who are not yet born, can only support the principle of non-discrimination against people with different sexual tendencies, but cannot accept the destruction of the concept of marriage or of the family. The significance of this concept, as recognised by Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is fundamental to the succession of generations and the educational capacities of heterosexual couples.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which I have the honour of chairing, gave me the task of acting as rapporteur on this document, together with the rapporteurs from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs, sitting jointly. This is the first time that Rule 51 of the Rules of Procedure has been applied and I must say that, in my view, the result has been very satisfactory with regard to the cooperation between the three rapporteurs in carrying out their work. There have, in fact, been problems, some of them serious, with regard to the timeframe and, above all, the involvement of the shadow rapporteurs and the timely translation of the amendments, of which there were nearly 500. However, all that is due not to Rule 51 itself, but rather to the very short deadlines that we gave ourselves in order to have a document that we could submit to the Council summit taking place on 10 December. It was thus inevitable that there would be these problems linked to the pace of work. For the rest, I believe that we should acknowledge that Rule 51, which has been used for the first time, is useful. The document under consideration by this Parliament cannot be explained in the few seconds that remain to me. However, I must express my satisfaction that the codecision system has been extended to become the normal system of legislation, that immigration is now understood to be a European issue – and I hope that this is how the Commission and the Council interpret it – and not a problem for individual Member States acting in solidarity with each other, that the view taken of cooperation with the national parliaments is not that they are guardians laying down limits, but rather positive collaborators in the legislative process, and finally, that there is that reference to human rights which is extremely important, and which is the spirit of the European Union. I therefore believe that, in view of the fact that it was not supposed to detail down to the finest particulars the implementation of the Stockholm Programme, but only to formulate general outlines, this document is certainly a positive step. There will be time and a way in which to make it more comprehensive, and to include more details. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we shall of course respect your decisions, but it is my understanding that there are some reservations about certain amendments, namely that they do not directly relate to the Treaty of Lisbon. I may be mistaken, but it seems to me that, until now, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has had general powers to make proposals concerning regulatory amendments. It can do this if the amendments are suggested by a group of Members, or by individual Members, and also on its own initiative. Therefore, the fact that the opportunity has been taken to make a few corrections, also with reference to other aspects, within the ambit of a wider reform of the Rules of Procedure under the Treaty of Lisbon cannot, in my view, be seen as unacceptable – all the more so since quite a few amendments would serve to reflect the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon in the Rules of Procedure, sometimes through rules that are reproduced technically and materially in them, but much more often through reference to the spirit of the treaty. One need only think of the role of Parliament, which has been strengthened in relation to the Council, but which is also being strengthened by the Rules of Procedure where the internal relationships with institutions within Parliament itself are concerned. We shall, of course, respect your decisions, Mr President, but I felt it was necessary to make these observations. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, first of all I wish to correct my first and second votes – I meant to abstain, but I made a mistake because I acted in haste and pressed the wrong button. My first two votes are abstentions from the whole day’s votes. The statement I am making is this: there is a grave original sin in the proposal that has led to today’s debate and it is a sin that has already been pointed out by the President of the Italian Republic. Added to this sin is the opportunism of choosing the Italian Prime Minister’s legal action against certain newspapers – a process that is clearly in full compliance with the rule of law – as a means by which to attack him. Therefore, we have not voted for the proposal by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, and so on, but nor have we voted for the motion by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) because, although it deserves recognition insofar as it safeguards Italy’s dignity, it totally overlooks the problem of the balance between the media and the other state powers, which exists in Europe and which is a serious problem in Italy too. This does not just concern the Italian Prime Minister’s conflict of interests in this area; it concerns other problems too. At national level, on the other hand, my party, the UDC, is continually challenging the majority on this. I believe that we, too, must send out a message of support by abstaining. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I all I feel it is my duty to thank the rapporteur, who has done a marvellous job, and, as chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I must also thank all of the members of the committee and of both committees – the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development – who delivered the opinion, for their very swift work. We have, in fact, tried to prepare a document – which I hope will be approved – that can be presented to the Council of 29 and 30 October. We are well aware that this report is not a definitive report. It is intended merely to point out a few courses of action, a path of some kind to follow, to the Council and thus to the High Representative who will be appointed. It will be the High Representative’s job to devise his own organisational plan which, in turn, will have to be examined by us. Therefore, it is only guidelines that are being submitted to our Parliament. We also know that the success of this operation regarding the External Action Service is linked to the role of the High Representative, who will have to be able to organise and manage everyone. Through him, we want a consistent and uniform foreign policy. We are well aware that there are problems, that much has already been said, but problems are there to be solved. The important thing is that the compass, the information, the scope is clear. The Brok report provides some interesting proposals in this regard – I have to be brief because my speaking time is up – but, in any case, they include the integration of the Service into the administrative structure of the Commission, the decision to further develop the Community model and the proposal, which is, moreover, laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, that the staff must be taken from the secretariats of the Commission and the Council and from the delegations of the Commission itself. There are two innovations that I believe are worth mentioning: Union embassies, headed by officials from the European External Action Service, which would also include the Commission delegations present in third countries and the Council liaison offices, with the possible secondment of experts from the Directorates-General; and the foundations that have been laid for the establishment of a European diplomatic college, which is an interesting idea. My speaking time has run out. I only hope that this report really is adopted, and adopted by a large majority. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to rationalise an apparently ambiguous feeling that I have after this first stage of the debate, because I fully subscribe to the strong words spoken by my chairman, Mr Daul, but I also subscribe to the words of Mr Sassoli who should, by all rights, be a political opponent of mine. Let me explain myself better: am I schizophrenic for having such ambivalent feelings, or am I trying unnecessarily to reconcile the fact that, in Italy, I sit on the opposition benches while, here, I find myself next to the People of Freedom party, in the People’s Party? I feel I can answer that by highlighting an obvious contrast between the scope and the importance of the subject of freedom of information, which is a very important subject… Were Montesquieu alive today, he would have spoken not only of legislative, executive and judicial powers, but of other powers too, and he would have put the fourth power, the press, in first place, as it represents a problem of freedom, of the fight against mental slavery, and a problem of democracy. On the other hand, the straw that broke the camel’s back after months and months of barbarisation of the entire Italian press – let it be said – of the right and of the left; the quality of the Italian press has been poor for months now because politics really has reached a low point – was Mr Berlusconi’s legal action. Please indulge me: I was a criminal judge for four years in the Fifth criminal division of the Court of Cassation, where we judged the crime of libel. This is how I know Mr Mauro is right: I saw many of these actions for libel, and no one protested. Citizens have the right to defend themselves in these situations too. I therefore hope that, by making a genuine attempt to reconcile seemingly opposing points, we will actually come up with a new and better way of tackling the problem for the whole of Europe and not just in regard to Italy. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, I was also told I had three minutes, but I will try to stay within two minutes. I would like to join many of my fellow Members in expressing my satisfaction. I think that it is now time to put into effect, to implement the Treaty of Lisbon as soon as the ratifications take place, something which we hope will happen imminently. The committee which I chair has been doing everything in its power for some time now but, above all, it is important for Parliament to be aware of its new responsibilities: it must not allow the de facto 
loss of any aspect of its wider legislative functions. I would, however, like to highlight one issue which I do not think has been raised so far: there were many reasons why the Irish people previously rejected the Treaty, but one was the fear, among some voters, that the European legal system could violate, in Ireland. certain fundamental values concerning the right to life and the notion of family. These fears were allayed through declarations adopted by the European Councils of December 2008 and June 2009. I think this is important not just for Ireland, but for the whole of Europe. It was clarified, in fact, that the acquis communautaire
 does not concern the area relating to the right to life and the family. This clarification does not apply solely to Ireland, but to all the Member States. In reality, there was no need to clarify this because in various judgments involving France, the United Kingdom and Poland, the European Court of Human Rights had already ruled that in the areas of life, the value of life, respect for life and the family, it must be left up to the Member States to decide according to their history, tradition and culture. However, Ireland’s attention to detail had the merit of formally clarifying this point which, as I was saying, now applies to the entire European Union. I believe that this is a good thing, which makes holding the double referendum worthwhile. Naturally, we know full well that European culture consists of the sum of the cultures of all of the countries that make it up, and we all want Europe to be not just an economic area but also, and above all, a community of values. I therefore think it proper that we show Ireland both our satisfaction and our gratitude for everything that it offers Europe in terms of its history and its ideals. Europe needed Ireland, not only for technical reasons relating to its mechanisms and organisational structure, but also for Ireland’s contribution to what we are all seeking: the essence of Europe.

My judgment on the motion for a resolution on the protection of minors in Lithuania is intended to demonstrate a very serious institutional concern. Often, individual MEPs or political groups claim to address issues that relate to the domestic policy of individual States: that does not seem right. In the case in point, the plan is seemingly to make the European Parliament express an essentially negative opinion on a Lithuanian law – the full content of which is unknown – with the laudable aim of protecting minors, while surreptitiously imposing a position that the individual Member States have been left to establish at their own discretion. This, I might add, is something which the European Court of Human Rights has stipulated on many occasions. The principle of equality is beyond doubt, and no one is trying to call into question the dignity of persons with particular sexual orientations. My reservation is of an institutional nature because it concerns the relations between the European Union and individual Member States. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 While, in non-EU countries caught up in the current crisis, the fight for growth and jobs is being met with economic and financial leverage – whether legal or monetary – under the control of a single political and administrative body, in Europe, we continue to endure political delays from an EU that still cannot overcome the issue of unitary governance. This situation is aggravated by the fact that, despite the major ongoing effort to strengthen coordination between Member States on their own budgets, conclusive action to coordinate tax systems is still excluded from political debate, especially in respect of the direct taxation system. This delay produces tax competition that could also be construed as dumping, which has a negative impact, especially on the stability of businesses, including geographically, and risks, above all, affecting areas that are already weak and corporate social responsibility. This is why I regret the failure to adopt the part of the amendment that highlighted the risks of tax competition, to the detriment of consolidating national budgets, and, to this end, suggested the introduction of a minimum rate of corporate taxes. I hope that we can make up for this delay in the near future. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 The ongoing global crisis has made clear the lack of political involvement in supra-national economic governance, especially in the European Union. When, way back in 1988-1989, European leaders took the brave decision to begin convergence of the Member State economies with a view to the single currency, both by completing the internal market and by coordinating the Member States’ economies, it was made very clear, from a pro-EU point of view, that this objective could only be fully achieved by twinning the pillar of monetary governance, under an autonomous European Central Bank, with the pillar of economic governance exercised by Commission, Council and Parliament. Only the two pillars together could underpin the future of the European Union. However, this sharing of responsibilities has to be combined with the sharing of opportunities and economic results. Just as, at the national level, varying rates of regional economic growth are balanced out by single-state governance, including by joint participation in the public debt, the same should happen at European level in relations between Member States, which should evolve, making shared, cooperative and reciprocal destinies a reality. I think that this report and the amendments that have been adopted are in line with this view. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 A local authority has the utmost political autonomy when it achieves total control on tax matters, and therefore has total economic and financial control over deciding its budget. Unfortunately, the serious delay in achieving this level of autonomy is particularly clear with regard to the agreement on the multiannual financial framework. During this very process, European and pro-European ambitions and responsibilities clash with the selfishness of the Member States, resulting in increased national and nationalist sentiment. It is regrettable that the political mentality that always made the common European interest a priority has been lost, replaced by an accountant’s mentality where what is given to the European budget and what is received nationally under ‘community’ policies are continually set off against one another. The EU will only reach its full political potential by boosting its powers on budgets and taxing genuine own resources, including through eurobonds and a financial transaction tax, and boosting its resources, so that they are suited to meet the challenges and political objectives that it aims to pursue and achieve. It seems to me that this joint resolution is heading in that direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

The global financial crisis, which began to show itself in 2008, is, unfortunately, far from over. Instead, in some ways, with productive sectors now weakened by the period we have gone through, it seems even more serious and now might become structural within economic systems. On the other hand, even the repeated and numerous recurrences of the original causes of the crisis demonstrate that the ‘market’ is not an abstract entity that can regulate itself efficiently, as experts in the new welfare economy would still have us believe, but that it is, instead, a system managed by a few individuals worldwide who, often unscrupulously, attack financial markets, productive systems and institutions with the hope of profiting from their weakening or even from their failure. The actions taken by each individual country are not enough to address this global crisis. What we need are decisions made at an equal level. The financial transaction tax would be useful in mitigating the devastating effects of raider activity, especially if it were adopted globally and if it did not impact on national bonds or pension funds. Meanwhile, and in the hope that this might happen, it is important that it should start, at least, with the European dimension. This report and the amendments adopted are in line with this outlook.

The globalisation of the economy has led to the need to step up economic cooperation between the EU and other areas of the world. This aim needs to be pursued not only through various fundamental principles that make trade balances sustainable, although these are, of course important, but, above all, through support for the EU’s production systems, to make them more competitive on the world stage. It is therefore necessary for both the principle of legal and economic/financial reciprocity and the anti-dumping principle to always be an integral part of economic agreements, with particular reference to the fiscal and social security dimensions, so that a correct approach may be taken based on the comparative and competitive advantages of enterprises and production systems. In addition, it is necessary for the principle of reciprocity to permeate access to Chinese public procurement. Finally, the EU ought to take a more farsighted and attentive approach to investments in developing countries, made also by competing countries, such as China, in order to better evaluate the impact of these interventions in political, economic, social and environmental terms. I believe that the report we have adopted seeks to achieve these objectives. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 The social dimension of our communities – particularly small and medium-sized ones – is more significant than their economic weight. In this vein, I would like to underline that some essential services, such as those relating to people’s health, the environment (including the water and waste cycles) and local public transport, should be thought of as directly connected to fundamental human rights. This is because they can be defined, in political terms, as public goods and services, even if they are managed by private entities. Making them more efficient, effective and economical, while pursuing increased and higher quality standards is another thing. Moreover, denying access to many sections of the population, especially the most vulnerable and neediest, whenever we apply the rules of the market plain and simple to these sectors is something else entirely. That is why, given their special status and social relevance, in the next reform being drawn up, we must retain a precise distinction between the rules that regulate State aid for services of general economic interest and the rules that govern other forms of State aid. The adopted report partly upholds this view. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 Different rates of development and the changes in the ways of life that exist in our societies have led to profound variations in the demographic pyramid. If higher life expectancy is a positive aspect of these changes, the same could not be said for others, in particular, for those that concern young people and women. With regard to these categories of the population, elements that have been shown to be inadequate include work policies that have put a strain both on training (including at university and post university), in favour of a more pronounced trend towards entering the world of work, and on accompanying policies concerning remaining in work, with a view to greater fulfilment of family needs. To this end, among the initiatives to be reinforced by more profitable use of Structural Funds, one could, on the one hand, include the provision of services in support of guidance and of satisfying the demand for work with job offers, whereby these services are adequate, operational and easily accessible to those who require them. On the other hand, one could intervene by strengthening policies in support of the family (including greater diffusion of public or private nurseries and organisation of flexible work). I believe that the approved report leads in this direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 Economic, social and territorial cohesion policy is one of the fundamental pillars on which our coexistence within the EU is based, as it promotes growth in areas struggling to develop in order to enable them to converge and compete fairly against more developed areas. The experience acquired also during the current programming period shows that delays in development are effectively recouped on the one hand by simplifying rules and procedures, while maintaining a rigorous pursuit of objectives, and, on the other, by strengthening the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of management and control systems. All this has to take place within the context of the broad and effective involvement of all the institutional, economic and social partnerships at the various local levels in order to identify the strategies and specific and operational objectives to be pursued. In addition to this, there needs to be effective programming and unified implementation by the different EU (structural, agricultural and neighbourhood policy funds) and national funds, recognising in project funding the capacity for integration of the various areas and production and the different private and public entities, including in a cross-border, inter- and intra-regional context. I believe that the report that I helped to approve contains these suggestions. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

Food security is a prerequisite for achieving balanced development at all levels. Its relationship with sustainable production in the primary sector can be seen in a number of different ways. In environmental terms, it is expressed through the use of eco-friendly techniques and products and through a non-speculative enhancement and management of the immense natural resources that are found in developing countries in particular. In economic terms, it is expressed partly by enhancing the competitive advantages between the various areas and countries – which can also enable developing countries to play an integral role in balanced and global growth – and partly by promoting the link with the land through a focus on locally sourced products, where energy costs and pollution linked to transport and the quality and tradition of the products can be better protected. In social terms, the processes of gradual urbanisation and population growth, above all, in developing countries, have to be reconciled with the needs of living in these places. Lastly, in political terms, because the primary and food sectors represent the most tangible, daily platform for relations between people, including in their relationships with institutions. I believe that the report we have adopted upholds this view. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 Economic cooperation, including trade cooperation, is one of the instruments through which foreign policy is implemented. The European Union is founded, first, on sectoral trade and, second, on the wider single market: a foundation that is still suffering from the lack of a single foreign policy; a wide-ranging, strong and authoritative policy that helps to define strategic positions on economic cooperation with other countries and geopolitical regions, as well. This situation allows each Member State to develop in an independent and uncoordinated fashion, either on its own or in the various international organisations to which it belongs. In order to ensure that the Doha negotiations have a favourable outcome, while also reiterating the usefulness of the World Trade Organisation as a forum for solving the problems of balanced development and cohesion among all the member countries, we need to work on integrating the other countries, too, into long-term policies, firstly by building on their competitive advantages, and secondly by strengthening their ability to shape their own development. I believe that the adopted report makes a contribution, however small, to this prospect. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 Economic, social and territorial cohesion policy is one of the fundamental pillars of an EU that is in favour of bridging gaps in the development of geographical areas and sectors of society and the economy. If correctly focused on people and bottom-up subsidiarity, it allows the promotion of integrated, systemic growth, stimulating initiative and civic sense and fostering the development of responsibility and the common good. The experience of the current 2007-2013 programming period has taught that in the next programming period we need above all to give greater responsibility to the actors, beneficiaries and targets of strategic and operational programming, as well as to its implementation, monitoring and the assessment of whether objectives have been met, through programmes providing incentives and disincentives to encourage the meeting of targets and allowing greater transparency in the processes and work involved in active participation in them. It is also important to make the entire structure of governance and management simpler and more flexible, and to foster the capacity for integration of the different territories in a cross-border, inter- and intra-regional sense. Finally, it is necessary for the resources and objectives of cohesion policy in the next programming period to be in line with the challenges the EU will be undertaking, including the EU 2020 strategy. I think that the report I helped to approve shows the right way to do this. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

The internal market, competition policy and fundamental freedoms have accompanied the growth of an open and integrated Europe. The economic vision that led to its creation in the beginning is not the only dimension of a political reality that intends to take part in governing globalisation. This contains other dimensions which generate shared visions and policies which have to make people the focus of their attention. This change of approach makes it even more important to encourage the creation of an economic and social context in which the need to develop one’s own identity and the response to the fundamental needs of daily life and future prospects are what drive public actions. In this context social services of general interest take on a bigger, different role in which the financial aspect, in terms of budget compatibility and medium- and long-term sustainability, play a important part, but only in the context of the primary objective of developing human beings and quality of life in a family, social, working and institutional sense.

 Economic, social and territorial cohesion policy is one of the fundamental pillars of an EU that is conscious not only to promote and develop excellence by encouraging innovation, but also to create convergence and bridge the gaps of and in less developed areas compared with more advanced ones. Joint programming was the most innovative aspect of the period 2007-2013, having led the regions and the Member States to adopt an integrated approach between territories and resources as part of their strategic and operational programming. However, this important approach is liable, in many cases, to be frustrated by the considerable autonomy and strong competition existing between the various authorities in charge of managing each monofund programme. By failing to work together properly, they seriously endanger not only the valuable integration of operations and actions that could be achieved, but also the benefits and the impact that those actions could create. In the next programming period, then, it may be worth reverting to multifund programmes, incorporating in them the experience gained from joint programming and encouraging shared and responsible management between the various stakeholders in charge of regional development. I believe that the adopted report makes an effective contribution to these objectives. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 The agricultural sector still plays a strategic role today in our societies and economies. It does so firstly from a food perspective, since not only does it provide the raw materials for food, but the safety of that food is essential for our health. It does so secondly from an environmental perspective, since the vitality of the sector and the quality of its production processes make for environmentally friendly land management. It does so thirdly from a social perspective, since it represents a challenge to provide high-quality, innovative jobs for young people. It does so fourthly and finally from an economic perspective, since a local/global approach allows for the economic development of traditional, high-quality, certified and high added value products, through the adoption of management models that turn businesses and their products into competitive cooperatives on a global scale. A fair CAP that promotes micro, small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises and high-quality, traditional and certified products, that supports environmentally friendly processes, that introduces aid ceilings and that sets aside sufficient resources for rural development is an ambitious and far-sighted policy that benefits citizens, consumers and agricultural operators. I believe that the adopted report offers this possibility. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

One of the fundamental objectives of the European Union is to link human and social development to economic development. If these two factors are in balance, then this means, on the one hand, that people can do their work with adequate remuneration that is in line with human dignity and professional quality, while, on the other hand, it allows business owners to develop their businesses by following market principles, though tempered by the human environment in which this must take place. This perspective – which some people also call the social market economy – is actually a new paradigm that goes beyond welfare economics and returns instead to the centrality of the human being. Such a paradigm shift necessarily involves consistent support for social policy, including fostering the relevant standards and related corporate responsibility. This approach and vision cannot, and must not, have an impact merely within the EU, but must also be applied to external action wherever possible, particularly during the negotiation of agreements. Respect for International Labour Organisation standards, the principles laid down in the European Social Charter and social dialogue are just some of the areas that can be discussed on these occasions. I believe that the report we have adopted offers sound backing for these objectives. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

Indicators are a concise way of interpreting a given phenomenon. Simple phenomena can be interpreted using simple indicators, while complex phenomena require complex indicators. Gross domestic product is a simple indicator, while development is a complex phenomenon. Indeed, the economic development of an area has various dimensions that are not included in GDP, which takes a snapshot of a given moment. Other elements of interpretation are totally neglected, such as investment in intangible infrastructure, including know-how (people, processes and products, to mention just a few examples), and investment in tangible infrastructure, including communication and transport networks (ICT networks and road and rail networks, for example). In addition, GDP is not even suitable for identifying regions assisted by EU regional cohesion policy. For these reasons, the European Commission’s efforts to go beyond GDP and create a series of data and indicators that will improve its ability to interpret phenomena and help to better define policies and financial allocations should be commended. The report that we have adopted seems to me to be moving in this direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 The economic and financial crisis has highlighted the total lack of ethics in this area. The paradigm of the new welfare economy, whereby the pursuit of individual wellbeing is the key to collective welfare, which is the sum of its parts, is apparent in all its inadequacy. According to this approach, individual interest does not set any limitation on the collective interest, let alone the general interest. Yet because public government must set general interest as a framework within which to operate, and provide free space for freedom and individual rights within it, it must support this with a fair and progressive tax system. Consistent with this approach, which must be supported at global level by the EU and all G8 and G20 countries, the revenue from financial transactions must be made comparable to other revenues through a specific tax system that favours greater responsibility by operators together with other rules and new paradigms. The introduction of Eurobonds designed for the crisis fund and infrastructure projects could strengthen the EU’s ability to take action if they were additional to the EU budget. The report that we have adopted seems to me to be moving, albeit slowly, in this direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 Agriculture represents a strategic sector for the European Union. While its impact in terms of employment and GDP may not equal that of other sectors, it assumes greater significance with regard to the characteristics of our respective regions and food traditions, since it ensures that we are self-sufficient in many ingredients that are essential for our farm produce, traditional or otherwise. Furthermore, this sector plays a fundamental role in safeguarding and protecting the environment and ensuring the sustainable development of our regions. It is obvious that trade agreements have to be made, particularly in the trade rounds of the World Trade Organisation. For that to happen, however, the European Union has to pay more attention to safeguarding quality, traditional and certified products, so that they can be protected internationally to avoid fraud on foreign markets involving products that have been falsely attributed to our countries. The basic tenet of the approved report seems to go in the right direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the proposed text because pensions are one of the fundamental institutions of the system of worker’s rights and duties. They are essential for the continuation of a decent standard of living for the people concerned and for their whole families, especially when it comes to receiving adequate support so as to attain a decent standard of personal and family life. By setting this threshold as a long-term goal, it is obvious that sustainable pension systems are necessary to offer certain minimum prospects to workers. While I respect the principle of bottom-up subsidiarity, with primary authority and responsibility for adequacy and opportunity for reform lying with the Member States, there is a need for convergence of pension systems in Europe, so as to ensure full and genuine freedom of movement for workers and enterprises and also full and mutual recognition and parity of the various pension systems within the Member States. Indeed, while I acknowledge the differences in the cost of living and in wage levels between Member States, there is a need to establish long-term convergence both internally within each Member State and within the EU as a whole, so as to promote a decent and adequate level of life expectancy.

The internal market and competition policy are two cornerstones of the process of European unification which aim not only at strengthening the European Union’s economy and its businesses but, above all, at realising the fundamental freedoms of the Union. This objective must be pursued in the interests of all European citizens and enterprises, offering equal opportunities and substantial equality while avoiding problems, additional costs and superstructures that could differentiate, discriminate between or limit the opportunities to enjoy or protect one’s own rights. Giving all European Union citizens the right to express themselves in their own language in dealings with the EU institutions is a fundamental right in terms of equality, equal opportunities and non-discrimination. The use of just some of the official languages can technically only be justified within the activities of the EU institutions and not in its relations with citizens, enterprises and institutions in the Member States. Enhanced cooperation procedures are useful when they increase the opportunities for those that participate in them, without compromising them for the others. I therefore voted against the recommendation since I think enhanced cooperation is unacceptable in such a delicate context as the political equality of languages, as it would create discrimination in terms of the right of equal opportunity to access the EU’s fundamental freedoms.

Humanitarian aid now has a larger and more important role than in the past. Differing rates of development and growing inequality in opportunity and resource distribution in geographical, social and generational terms, increasing climate change (for which humans are partly to blame) and the associated increase in natural disasters, increased environmental pollution, imbalanced anthropic pressure concentrated in large urban areas, and uneven population growth in some areas of the planet, have led to a rising number of humanitarian disasters in which aid takes on an essential role in restoring basic living conditions and human dignity. In view of this, if humanitarian aid is needed to assist people hit by disasters, then in turn, any interventions as a result of EU foreign policy – which is still to be defined – cannot be apportioned according to each Member State’s areas of interest and influence, but should take on a European dimension.

 Agriculture plays a key role in the development of communities. Defining its output as a primary sector in economic terms relates not only to the historical trend of its development, but also, and above all, to its role in stabilising societies and their economies. Balanced agricultural production has to be attentive not only to the quantities produced, but also, and primarily, to the quality of the output, so that it assists in the healthy development of the population. From this perspective, therefore, food security plays a key role, and its protection – particularly in terms of traditional and local produce – increases the opportunities for development throughout the territory. The positive correlation between food security and the quality and healthiness of agricultural products also involves increasing their eco-friendliness, while particular care must be paid to the domino effect caused by the uncontrolled introduction of genetically modified organisms, in order to provide, in the first instance, the necessary certainties as regards the medium- and long-term effects that these products could have on health and local economies.

Greater courage in formulating proposals for the efficient use of EU resources that make it possible to achieve binding objectives and concrete benchmarks; 4. effective and incisive EU governance of the economy and finance, as well as financial participation of employees in the success of the company that allow more widespread, balanced and inclusive economic and social development.

 The Stockholm Programme is an essential next step in the development of the European area of freedom, security and justice towards a greater focus on individuals. A greater focus that contributes not only to a more comprehensive perspective on citizenship, including respect for human beings and human dignity, but also to a perspective on the law and on justice that makes it accessible throughout the Union, so that individuals can exert their rights without any internal borders. A focus on individuals that must be guaranteed across the board, including as regards the growing phenomenon of immigration and asylum, albeit in strict compliance with the rules on civil harmony, including security. The Commission Action Plan is a consistent embodiment of the Stockholm Programme. When developing European areas of freedom, security and justice, however, respect must always be shown for the principle of subsidiarity, which encourages respect for individuals and for the traditions that form an integral part of their history.

 The ongoing economic and financial crisis, in severely affecting the economies of the ‘developed’ countries of the West, has shown that the economic paradigm of the efficiency and capacity for self-regulation of the markets is no longer based on reality, because reality has called for all economic and market players, especially financial market players, to act responsibly and ethically, something which they have completely failed to do in recent times. The disruption caused in financial terms to the entire economy shows that the industrial sector requires a huge amount of support, since it is still a sector of fundamental importance for the economy, especially the real economy. When taking into account the competitive and comparative advantages and disadvantages between regions, especially at international level, we must not forget that the mining industry is present in areas in which the development of sound economic and occupational alternatives should be encouraged as a preliminary step and in which welfare support provisions should be enhanced to prevent painful increases in unemployed workers whom it is difficult to redeploy.

The role of rural development is essential to keep our territories alive, both because of its end product and because it is so widespread. Seen in this context, the livestock sector is one of the most significant for our communities. Indeed, beyond food and economic aspects (though important, and in which regard the quality of the products is ensured by environmentally sustainable techniques), farming represents the most widespread form of occupation, protection and development of rural areas. This is why the European Union – including through the common agricultural policy, above all, in its post-2013, reformed incarnation – and each Member State must promote its continued existence, not only by coming up with innovative techniques for farming and economically and environmentally sustainable management, but also by strengthening their wider role as guardians of the environment and the land protecting them from the market crisis by reducing production costs, making the best of their products and greater organisation on the market.

Justice in relations between generations represents the new global challenge that needs to be adequately tackled. Modern societies have found themselves presiding over a period of constant growth in which, above all in the last few decades, new generations have had better conditions and prospects ahead of them than previous generations. Now, the situation has surpassed the limits of seemingly endless growth and we find ourselves faced with a debate between rights and limited resources. All countries, beginning with the developed and democratic ones and their related organisations (like the EU), must therefore work determinedly, conclusively and cogently to work out policies, make choices and implement them coherently for a greater equilibrium between current and future generations, so that the division and distance between those with rights and those without, and those with resources and those without, may be reduced.

The vote for a legislative motion for a resolution amending Directive 92/85/EEC was taken not only to support new and better measures for the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding but also, more generally, to support new measures to promote a better work-life balance. Even though the Italian legal system is more innovative, the increase in the number of weeks of maternity leave at European level represents a strong boost in favour of family assistance to newborn babies. The support for paternity leave is also a step in the same direction even though making this compulsory is not perhaps the best way to pursue the laudable aim of ensuring the greater effective presence of both parents at the most demanding time for the new household and ensuring the father is more aware and involved. Support for and extension of the rights of adopted children allows a reinforcement and, it is to be hoped, also a simplification of the adoption process.

 Late payments in commercial transactions between undertakings, and between undertakings and public authorities, are one of the things currently hampering the recovery of economic growth. Approval of the new directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions represents a major innovation that will require appropriate preparation, above all, of the public sector, in both political and administrative terms. In political terms, so that financial and budgetary planning can take account not only of the impact of European Union rules on the Stability and Growth Pact, but now also of the impact of the new rules on late payments, which, if not satisfactorily managed, could have both a direct and reflex effect on the room for manoeuvre of governments at various levels. In administrative terms, appropriate preparation is required for the correct financial management of public bodies, beginning with the ratio between liabilities and expenditure, so that tax revenues and, hence, the people, are not weighed down by burdens such as interest payments which could have a significant effect on public finances. Finally, it seems important for there to be particular awareness and flexibility regarding several sectors, such as the health sector, in which the public authorities have run up significantly late payments owed to undertakings, for regular goods and services provided.

 In the vote on the report by Mrs Gallo on the enforcement of intellectual property rights in the internal market, two mutually complementary rights have been reconciled. One is the particular intellectual property right of the author and/or editor of the item created, and the other is the more general right to knowledge of the users of the item itself. The European Union cannot only be an internal market, where businesses operate and protect the goods and services they provide, but it is also a shared space of citizenship and freedom, in which citizens can express and inform themselves and each other. Making everything bow to private interests, creating excessive, unjustified and unfair limits to the free dissemination of the creations of the intellect could unduly compromise the shared space, where the expression of thought takes on the significance of a public asset. Hence, it is important that intellectual creations are protected, but it is just as important that the methods of their protection are not excessive in order to make them fully available, as easily and quickly as reasonably possible, to the entire community, beginning with the Internet community.

A common foreign policy and a common economic policy are the necessary objectives of the European integration process. It should be remembered that the single currency was also chosen to speed up the integration process, which had come to a standstill in Nice. Given the way in which it is being organised, the European External Action Service is in danger of adopting a paralysing ‘do nothing’ approach, rather than being the start of a virtuous unifying process.

 This proposal for a regulation is blazing a legislative trail on a subject that is fundamental for European Union citizens and enterprises, namely the transparency and dissemination of information on food products. While, on the one hand, it is important to achieve an internal market where all citizens and all enterprises can make the best possible choices, on the other hand, we must take into account the extraordinary heritage of food, wine and gastronomic culture that moulds the traditions of many parts of Europe, thus benefiting health and also economic, social and environmental sustainability. During the process of amending the proposal, both in detail and in broad terms, it has become apparent that the European Parliament, in performing this function so fundamental to the exercising of its responsibilities, is turning into a place where the interest of multinationals are transacted to the detriment of consumers. When faced by this inequality of power, which should be balanced out by the pursuit of public interest by the institution, we can only marvel at the growing public disinterest in the process of European integration. These observations are not motivated by national interests but by the judiciousness of preserving typical local food products and the strong local bond between producers and consumers.Carlo Casini,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution that we will vote on contains three points, as the Commissioner has underlined. The first deals with bringing forward the date of the elections: the proposal is aimed at ensuring that the Commission will be in a position to start work at the end of the summer. We must verify whether this is feasible – as the Commissioner has pointed out – to ensure that the date chosen will affect turnout positively rather than negatively. I believe that the most important proposal, however, is for nominations by the political parties of candidates for the Commission Presidency, and I prefer to speak of ‘political parties’ here rather than ‘political families’, precisely in order to underline the need for the creation of genuine European political parties. This is very important if Europe is to capture the imagination of the European electorate. The declining turnout is due also to the fact that during the European elections various national rather than European matters are discussed. The European elections are seen as nothing more than a test of the domestic political situation. During the election campaign we must talk about Europe, and the citizens must be firmly convinced that their votes count for something in terms of European policies. I think that nominating candidates for the Commission Presidency would help to convince the citizens of this. Europe will certainly be discussed more than in the past in these upcoming elections, because the economic crisis has focused attention on the basic debate of whether there should be more Europe, less Europe or even an end to Europe. It is absolutely essential to give citizens the opportunity to choose the government of Europe and the President of the Commission. The third question has to do with the make-up of the Commission, apart from the question of gender balance: we are debating whether it might not be better for a quota of future Commissioners, established in numerical terms or in some less determined manner, to be drawn from among MEPs. This would also give the electorate the feeling that their vote makes a difference. For these reasons, I think that we should support the resolution. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 The continued insistence on calling for European documents against homophobia demonstrates that the true objective is different from the apparent one. The principle of equality of all human beings, their dignity and the consequent need to respect everyone’s freedom regardless of their sexual orientation is an accepted fact, on which all parliamentarians agree. It is reasonable, therefore, to suppose, as indeed is clear from the resolution in question, that the objective pursued by the emphatic rejection of homophobia is to make same-sex marriage acceptable. It is implicit in the text that there is an aspiration to educate children to consider a same-sex relationship as having the same value as marriage, as the foundation of the family and therefore of the state, as recognised by Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We must not confuse the duty to guarantee freedom for all citizens with the state’s promotion of and support for what constitutes its foundation. On this point, educational and cultural aspects play a fundamental role and we must therefore oppose a misguided line of action that will result in public harm. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Article 6 should be implemented and it should be implemented soon, because it is a legal obligation that is required of us. The committee that I am honoured to chair has worked quickly and I would like to thank Mr Guerrero Salom and my fellow Members who worked on this. A contact group has also been set up between the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly and Parliament and I think this link should be reprised once again. We now call upon Mr Bødskov and Mr Kallas to pick up the pace and come to conclusions. I will not hide the problems, which are not structural – since you might say that we have already resolved those – but certainly substantial and procedural. They, however, can only be resolved in practice, once the Union has acceded to the Convention. In terms of the substance, there is one particular issue. As far as I know, this is the only case in the world in which a declaration, a legally binding act on human rights, applies to a territory where there is another legal act – the Convention of the Council of Europe – which contains the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This certainly poses a few problems, especially in procedural terms: who will have the last word? That is the major problem, but we cannot resolve it now. Meanwhile, let us get on with accession. The solution will emerge from case law, probably using the principle that the European Court of Human Rights applies, whereby all other remedies must already have been attempted before recourse may be made to the Court. In this sense, the European Court of Human Rights could be the court of last instance, even after the Court of Justice of the European Union.

Equality between women and men is an undeniable achievement of the modern era. Its foundations are equal human dignity and universal recognition of human rights. Unfortunately, in the report we are discussing today, there is an unacceptable contradiction that radically changes its meaning. Human dignity and human rights concern all human beings and therefore also the most fragile, weak and poor. Demanding abortion as a woman’s right, hiding this request in a misleading fashion in a question on sexual and reproductive rights (which in itself is worthy of full consent, provided that they do not include the right to destroy the life of an unwanted child) is unacceptable. For this reason I cannot vote in favour of the report. I would like to add that equality between men and women does not mean having the same identity and that motherhood is the sign of a capacity for receptivity (what may be called ‘feminine genius’) that man does not have. In that sense, women can walk at the head of all humanity towards goals of freedom, justice, peace and solidarity. But, to be themselves, they must not walk alone, but rather accompany all the weakest people on Earth, starting off from their own children. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not able to go into detail about the three issues raised by the Commission. I believe that these issues should be seriously looked into. However, I am sure that there has been lengthy discussion on the matter by my Committee on Constitutional Affairs, when the constitution had not yet been approved and there was already criticism of it, for reasons that people are too afraid to voice. Firstly, because there is the reference …  (The President cut off the speaker) Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Many of the speeches in our long debate have been rather generic. It has not been clearly shown which provisions of the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights have been violated by Hungary, or which precise provision of Hungarian law should be censured. Only the Commission has indicated three more precise areas for investigation. I believe that in this regard we need to have faith in the Commission and in the Hungarian Government and Parliament. However, there is an underlying issue that needs to be brought to light. Attacks continue to be made on the Hungarian Constitution, but no one has the courage to indicate the real reasons why a certain European radical left-wing is supporting a campaign of denigration against a country which has great merit in the fight for democracy and freedom. What is disturbing about the Hungarian Constitution is the reference to Christian roots, recognition of human dignity from the moment of conception, and statement that the family is a natural state based on marriage between a man and a woman. I do not believe that these three aspects conflict with European values. In fact they are an exemplary description of the foundations of such values, which should be taken as a model by all of European law. Carlo Casini,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to thank all those who worked on this text, starting with the working group, in which all the leading members of the parties present in this House met, but also my committee, which did some valuable work on this issue. I believe that we need a very broad consensus to demonstrate that this Parliament is a transparent parliament, that it is concerned only with the common good, and that each one of us is personally honouring the commitment, made back at the time of the elections, to serve only the common good and European integration. Hence, I believe that there should be a very broad consensus, which is why I would ask Mr Gargani to withdraw his oral amendments; although they are worded very well, they would prevent this broad consensus from being reached. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the people are the foundation of democracy. ‘People’ means identity, a combination of history, traditions and ideals, but it also means unity and the desire to have a single government. On that basis, a single electoral system is clearly an instrument for building a population, a European demos
. This European demos
 still does not fully exist, as demonstrated by the fact that in the last European elections there was a much lower turnout and hence a lack of responsiveness, and by the fact that national debates have focused primarily on national problems and not on European problems. The proposals made in the Treaty of Lisbon should therefore be implemented. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament is not obliged to present or draft a uniform electoral law; the Treaty merely indicates that it has the power to do so, but it is an extraordinarily important power, and therefore we must not abandon our plan to undertake this reform of the 1976 Act. We will refer this document by Mr Duff – whom I thank once again in my capacity as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs – back to committee. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs adopted his text almost unanimously, and we are somewhat reluctant today to see it be referred back to committee. However, precisely because we must not back down in any way, I believe that Parliament should redraft the text so that it is more workable and can receive broader support, but that referral back to committee should not be a way of shelving the reform. The need for a European vision is not due solely to the fact that elections could be held in a transnational college; there is also the question of what the direct election by the people of the Members of the Commission or at least of the Commission President would involve. It is with that question that I shall therefore conclude my speech, extending my thanks once again to the rapporteur, Mr Duff. Carlo Casini  (PPE
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Prime Minister, I share in the thanks already expressed by others, though I am not going to specify the individual points that justify this gratitude. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO), which I chair, has had the chance to meet you on a number of occasions, including in your own country. We first met you as a delegation and then within the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs; we have witnessed the constant, unambiguous and pro-European commitment of the Hungarian Presidency. The AFCO would like to thank you in particular for your contribution this semester to concluding the report on the citizens’ initiative. Likewise, thank you for the statements that Mrs Győri made here just recently as she took on the commitment, on behalf of the Council, to adhere to the transparency register as soon as possible. The Polish Presidency can hardly fail to follow suit. Hungary chose ‘Stronger Europe’ as its slogan and I sincerely believe that this was well-chosen. You have succeeded in riding out a storm that was made even more intense by the criticisms levelled by Parliament. I must say, as a constitutional scholar – indeed, I have written a book on all the constitutions in Europe – that it is unheard of to try and criticise the constitution of a Member State for reasons of domestic policy. It is also unprecedented to say that a constitution is incompatible with European principles because it refers to human and family values, which are precisely the values of the European tradition and the very building blocks of Europe. I therefore thank you not only for the strong and courageous work of your Presidency, but also for the Constitution of Hungary. Carlo Casini,  
rapporteur

Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will make a single statement covering both matters, which are on the same subject. With this debate and the vote which will follow, we will conclude a task and a period of negotiations in the working group chaired by Mrs Wallis and composed of fellow Members from all political groups, as well as a Commission delegation led by Mr Šefčovič, which has resulted in the drafting of an agreement for the establishment of a common Transparency Register. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) has prepared this report in a few months and has also finalised a report on the amendment of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. Personally, I was very surprised at the amount of public attention that this transparency agreement has garnered. I fear that people think the results will have a greater effect than was actually pursued. Transparency is the defence of right political action, but it is not the right instrument for getting to the heart of corruption. The recent cases of journalists trying to corrupt a few MEPs could also happen outside parliamentary premises. Furthermore, would-be corruptors know how to avoid being identified and the registers are not, therefore, a silver bullet. The right tool for the job is criminal law. Yet if the criminal law of the Member States is not sufficient, we will need to reread Articles 82 to 86 of the Treaty of Lisbon, reflect on whether we can consider the corruption of MEPs to be cross-border crime or an act otherwise detrimental to the Union’s financial interests and determine whether or not to create a European Public Prosecutor, which would, moreover, be a significant step along the path to unity. The Transparency Register has a more modest task. In some countries the term lobbyist has a negative meaning, while in others lobbying is seen as an almost an act of public service because it informs decision-makers on issues they might not otherwise know about. This is especially important for the European Parliament, because often the issues faced by MEPs are very complex and technical and we almost always need to find a balance between businesses and countries with divergent interests. This is where lobbyists become very useful. So we shall no longer call them lobbyists but stakeholders. Of course, interests can be conflicting, and rightly so. I used to be a judge and I can say that cross-examination of opposing sides is considered a condition for uncovering the truth and obtaining justice. So, having lobbyists or stakeholders with conflicting interests is a good thing: what is important is that the judge – and therefore also the MEP – maintains his freedom of thought, independence, and his honest search for the common good. Hence, we have established the Transparency Register, in mutual agreement between Parliament and the Commission with the hope that the Council will soon join the agreement. Those who wish to represent their interests are free to have access to our premises but they must be listed in the Register, where all information needed to identify their legal and financial status will be recorded. The Register is public. There are also organisations that do not pursue selfish interests but try to collaborate in European policies in the name of general values, such as churches, political parties and regions. They do not need to be added to this Register: but, if they have separate offices exclusively tasked with maintaining contact with European institutions, they must be included in their Register, though subject to a different legal regime to stakeholders. As already stated, the new Register also contains an amendment to the Rules of Procedure. There are therefore two reports, but in any case this is just a first step towards more complete transparency. Some hypotheses are already being researched and could be turned into rules after further reflection hence point 9 of the document adopting the agreement indicates the possibility for the reports to carry the details of the stakeholders who met with MEPs during the preparation of the report in question. This broad provision for possible amendments leads me to express a negative opinion on amendments which would put limits on such future deliberations. I hope, however, that Council will join this agreement in short order and that there is also immediate and broad consensus in this House, a strong signal of the duty of transparency and also a call to action. I hope that the vote is nearly unanimous. Carlo Casini,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to clarify a few things. I too would like to strongly emphasise that this agreement was concluded long before the outbreak of the episode with the British journalists. Unfortunately, this is one way in which false information is spread through the media. For example, a major Italian newspaper, the Corriere della Sera
, has today poked fun at Europe by saying that we acted too late and only after these events with journalists. This is not true. It unjustly encourages distrust of Europe. The agreement had been reached long beforehand. If anything, this discussion has arisen with some delay because, once the scandal had exploded, we wondered if we could attempt to further strenthen the agreement. The text has, however, remained the unchanged. That is the first clarification. The second concerns the question of obligation. The register is already mandatory. Those who want to lobby must enrol themselves in the register. I cannot understand what ‘obligatory’ means: it cannot mean that all companies, all enterprises or all citizens must be entered in this register. That is not possible. If anything, it is up to individual MEPs, who, when approached by someone who wants to exert pressure on them, must invite them to register before making contact. The third point refers to possible future amendments. There is a working group for this purpose, which I think needs to have as much room for manoeuvre as possible. I agree that we should identify the lobbyists encountered during the course of the negotiations but I do not know if this task belongs only to the rapporteur or whether it should be extended to the President. We grant the working group the freedom to submit any necessary recommendations. Finally, I too wish to thank both Mr Šefčovič, who has made a huge contribution to the implementation of this agreement, and the representative of the Hungarian Government, for, among other things, the assurance given about the Council joining the agreement in short order, which without doubt has its own uncertainties seeing as the Council certainly represents the second chamber in this case. If the Council is also equipped with the register, this would therefore underline more effectively that the structure of Europe is made up of a government – the Commission – and a legislative body, consisting both of representatives of citizens and of states. Howver, I realise that there are still questions to be answered, since the Council of Ministers represents the states. I am, however, confident that we will come to a positive conclusion.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Giannakou, since she has carried out a great and intelligent piece of work. When we talk about political parties, we must take two problems into consideration. Firstly, parties are not much esteemed in any country. Secondly, when European elections take place, political parties are generally considered to pursue the interests of their national state and not the interests of Europe as a whole. At the level of public opinion, there is therefore a lack of positive esteem either for the parties or for their function in relation to the forging of Europe. We must therefore act urgently. Not only in the Treaty of Lisbon, as has already been noted, but in many constitutions, in almost all European constitutions, the function of the parties is considered to be of national interest, and thus crucial in the creation of democracy and the pursuit of common interests. It is important to stress that I am speaking about constitutions, and not ordinary laws, and that thus I am referring to the fundamental structures of the States and the European Union as a whole. It is thus pressing that we define a statute for parties that are truly European-facing, and not only an algebraic sum of individual national formations that have no permanent European structure on the ground. We need to see parties that think and act in a European context instead. The need I am describing is much more pressing if we really do want to see a uniform European electoral law which, hopefully, could even lead to a single European constituency to sit alongside the national constituencies. This will increase the individual European citizen’s sense of belonging to Europe. I come now to the core of my argument. As has already been emphasised – and I thank the Commissioner in advance – my committee has worked very hard, holding hearings and many meetings, but we need a proposal, an initiative from the European Commission, which brings together European parties within the law of the Union with a new legal form under public law, with a legal personality that is also valid in all Member States and with a uniform structure that allows them to act as representatives of the European public interest. I thank Mrs Giannakou and the Commissioner for their pledges. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everything is uncertain as regards the situation in North Africa. We do not know the immediate outcome of the civil war in Libya, we do not know whether the new political order in the Maghreb countries and Egypt will be conducive to democracy, or whether even worse conditions will arise with regard to democracy and relations with Europe. As for the arrival of an unstoppable stream of fugitives from the shores of Africa onto European shores and those of Lampedusa in particular, it is difficult, even in this case, to distinguish those who are fleeing from violence and fear of death, those who have, for example, escaped from prison, and those who are looking for a future that holds better things than the hunger in their country. We can nevertheless be sure of certain things. Firstly, human dignity must be respected in all human beings. Secondly, the European approach is to offer hospitality to all refugees. Thirdly, the borders of the individual states which form part of the European Union are the borders of Europe. Fourthly, there is a duty of solidarity among all European countries that are part of the Union: this was confirmed, strengthened and made legally binding by the Treaty of Lisbon, which also governs migration policy and the management of migratory flows in an area of freedom, security and justice. Fifthly, the instruments for coping with emergencies such as the current one are already in place, in the form of Directive 2001/55/EC, Frontex and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). The current situation is one of those situations that reveals whether Europe actually is or is not a reality. Commissioner, I greatly enjoyed your speech, but I think we should move from words to deeds. I am well aware of this and I know you will act. We hope that your proposal will be followed up. The important thing is that words are not enough: we need deeds to make Europe a reality. This is an opportunity to build Europe. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the strange thing about the Council’s proposal is that once it has been approved, it will pave the way for the creation of a permanent stability mechanism through an instrument of international law, and hence without a direct link to the institutional structure of the Union. This fact caused great concern in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which I chair, and which has the task of keeping an eye on the coherence of the Union's institutional framework. The simplified revision proposal therefore sparked a lively debate in which arguments based on the solid principles of the process of European integration came up against pragmatism and realpolitik
. In short, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs thinks that in order to deliberate on the proposal to amend the treaty, Parliament must assess the economic governance context under which the proposal falls. We need to know more about how the future mechanism will tie in with existing institutional structures. It would be a mistake to create twin structures which, in the long term, would carry the risk of the Union breaking up. The proposals and suggestions in the report by Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri aim to build suitable bridges between the Union’s institutional structure and the new mechanism. Moreover, I should like to emphasise that the Council must see these issues as fundamental for harmonious cooperation between the European institutions. I therefore strongly urge the European Council to take heed of this requirement and the consideration that it must give us, ahead of our vote on 24 March. As we await a positive sign, I should like to offer my heartfelt thanks for the brilliant work of the rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Hungarian Government has shown great sensitivity towards Europe and towards the principles upon which it is based in this affair. In fact, immediately after the approval of the Hungarian media law, a campaign was waged by the left, which used the phrase ‘gagging law’. In reality, only those who have experienced communism, fascism and Nazism know what a gagging law is, while democratic states know that freedom and pluralism of information are part and parcel of democracy. However, they should be harmonised with all other powers of the rule of law and must not harm, in particular, the foundation of democracy, which is human dignity. For example, Article 21 of the Italian Constitution does in fact guarantee freedom of information, but it also directly prohibits publications that are contrary to public morality. The 1948 law on the freedom of the press in Italy, which no one has ever challenged, lays down an obligation not for authorisation but for registration of any publication, as does the Hungarian law. The reservations that the European Commission itself has rightly expressed do not devalue the stated aim of the Hungarian law, and that aim of ensuring respect for human dignity is demonstrated precisely by the attitude that the Hungarian Government has taken by opening itself up immediately to the acceptance of criticism and taking responsibility for changing the law according to the guidelines provided to it. The statement that the fundamental rights of the European Union will be written into the Hungarian Constitution is also proof of Hungary’s fundamental desire to be part of European culture. In conclusion, I no longer understand the point of this discussion, except to ‘blame’ Hungary for having supported its government and parliament democratically by a two-thirds majority. Yet this gives Europe reason for hope, not reason for criticism. I am therefore grateful to the Commission and to the Hungarian Government. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Members who have already spoken have said practically everything. They have recalled the facts, assessed them and made specific requests. Therefore, as this is the last speech scheduled, I should like to add something that has not yet been said, and what comes to mind are the thoughts of a very great European, John Paul II, a man who very effectively helped to bring down the Berlin Wall. In his spiritual testament, he mentions the four values that underpin our future civilisation, that is to say, the civilisation of love: they are life, peace, bread and religious freedom. Then I think of everything that has been written by Giorgio La Pira, the former Mayor of Florence, who promoted large conferences on Christian civilisation at the height of the cold war. In his book Premesse della politica
 (‘Premises of politics’), he wrote that every political idea has a particular concept of man underlying it. For Christian Europe, he writes, man is essentially a praying being, that is to say, a being able to enter a dialogue, to conceive of the infinite and to talk to God. Taking away a man’s ability to take part in private and public dialogue is not only a negation of religion, but also a negation of man himself. I leave these thoughts with the House and with you, High Representative, as a contribution towards a concrete and effective commitment by our European Union, which is rooted in its Christian identity and never fails to proclaim its purpose of defending and promoting human dignity and human rights. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment aims to make our judgment on Egypt’s actions more incisive. It is not only a matter of acknowledging that Egypt has at least done something, but asking it to intervene quickly and immediately to free these hostages, urging the country never to use lethal force to repel people crossing the Sinai. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is also called upon to make immediate contact with the people currently being held hostage. ‘urges the Egyptian authorities to take all necessary measures to secure the release of Eritreans held hostage, to avoid the use of lethal force against illegal immigrants crossing the borders of the country, to protect their dignity and their physical and psychological integrity and to guarantee that detained migrants have the opportunity to contact the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and that the High Commissioner has access to all asylum seekers and refugees in custody’. Carlo Casini  (PPE
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, I should like to ask the proposer of the amendment to clarify an issue. According to the text read out, the requested intervention concerns all those who request the right of asylum. I should rather say ‘those who have the right of asylum’, because ‘who request’ is too dangerous, as there is the risk that anyone can request the right of asylum. Vice-versa, by coordinating this amendment with the intervention of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, it will be the latter that will assess this. In any case, I should ask the proposer to modify the amendment with the words ‘those who have the right of asylum’. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I am speaking above all to thank all the members of my committee for their good work, particularly Mr Lamassoure and Mrs Gurmai, who did a great job in achieving the aim of implementing one of the most important changes in the Treaty of Lisbon. The committee also listened to the opinion of all national parliaments and experts, working in close contact with the Commission – for which I offer my heartfelt thanks to Commissioner Šefčovič – and with the Council’s willingness to engage in dialogue, for which I should like to thank Mr Chastel. Applying Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure also worked very well, allowing us to work effectively with the Committee on Petitions. I personally supported the need for an annual deadline for the entry into force of the regulation and this was certainly not to delay its application but, quite the contrary, to ensure that its initial implementation will be carried out comprehensively and conscientiously so that all Member States, without exception, are able to fulfil the requirement to prepare participation and checking instruments. I believe that the greatest positive effect of the new scheme is to increase the awareness of EU citizenship, which has now been enriched by the power of participation in the legislative process, including providing the stimulus. I am also certain that the mechanisms provided will guarantee easy participation for citizens, while also preventing abuse. Ultimately, I believe that, with the Christmas festivities only a few days away, the adoption of this regulation represents a nice gift for European citizens and Europe itself. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 I abstained from the final vote on the Berlinguer resolution because Amendment 2 was thrown out. This was extremely important for ruling out possible erroneous interpretations of item 40, which states that Parliament ‘strongly supports plans to enable the mutual recognition of the effects of civil status documents’. The expression could suggest, for example, a European Union-wide obligation to recognise a union between people of the same sex registered in a Member State where such a union is permitted. In actual fact, we must distinguish between the effects of a completed legal action (in the case of marriage) and the effects of an official registration document. The latter bears full witness to what is documented (for example, that a homosexual marriage has been entered into in Holland) and this public witness is the effect of the official marital status document. However, the effects of the official registration document are something different and their recognition (for example, a survivor’s pension) is not permitted in a State that does not recognise them. Matters of family law are, in any case, part of the identity of individual states and cannot be touched by EU law. The possibility of a different interpretation led me to choose to abstain.

 I voted for Mrs Weber’s motion for a resolution on the Roma in Europe because of its balanced, constructive content. It is not enough to shout against discrimination, perhaps exploiting real and extremely serious problems for the purposes of party-political wrangling. Naturally, we need to firmly reassert the principles of non-discrimination, of free movement and the resulting rights and obligations – as does the resolution by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – but more important still is to undertake practical reforms to solve the problems, in order to implement fundamental human rights. Immigration is a European issue and the time has come, as called for by Mrs Weber’s resolution, to tackle it at European level. The Roma issue only partly overlaps with the issue of integration, and in any case it has specific features which must also be addressed at European level. The structure of the EU was designed on the premise of the territorial stability of the member peoples. A nomadic lifestyle may be a characteristic of a people, which must also be respected, but inclusion must come about in a spirit of solidarity, in accordance with European rules, without the individual Member States playing it by ear. This is the resolution’s proposal which won our support. Carlo Casini  (PPE
),

 Freedom of the media is beyond discussion, and no one in any democratic system can dispute the need for the media to be independent and pluralistic. In an information society such as ours, however, it is becoming increasingly evident that independence does not mean the absence of any rules and that pluralism is not a sufficient value. The power of the media in an information society is really a public power which Montesquieu, were he alive today, would have tried to balance against the other powers: legislative, executive and judicial. These three traditional powers must also be independent, but a reciprocal limit is established between them. As far as I can see, this problem has not been examined in depth. I will restrict myself to making two remarks. Journalists’ right to freedom is a human right that is at least equal to the right to dignity and privacy of every citizen. A duty of checks and balances therefore also exists. Judicial power must be transparent, but certain investigations must be absolutely secret during the initial stages if the truth is to be uncovered in the interests of justice and, therefore, ultimately of the public. I believe that these two aspects are always neglected in our debates. By making this speech, I have attempted to leave some record of them. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Once again we have the regrettable situation in which arguments proposing unjust solutions to the issue of the right to life are being applied to the discussion of a real and serious problem (in this case the fight against HIV), thus making it impossible to vote in favour. The use of the words ‘sexual and reproductive health’ has now become the means by which to convince parliaments to promote abortion. We must not let ourselves be deceived. Everyone, including myself, for a start, must promote sexual and reproductive health, but when the words indicate a different and, in fact, opposite state of affairs (whereby killing a human being is understood as a woman’s right to freedom), it then becomes necessary to expose the deceit. Abortion in the world is a real tragedy, but it is a real tragedy in our Europe too! My intention in voting against the resolution is not to hinder the wide-ranging efforts to combat AIDS, but to oppose the method and the content that I mentioned. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their continued, determined and intelligent work. The committee which I chair, given the evident and sensitive institutional implications resulting from the creation of the new Service, has followed the preparation of the text of the agreement extremely closely since the very beginning. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs not only participated in the work of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, under the very strict definition of cooperation laid down in Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure, but it also selected both of the rapporteurs. I am certain that Parliament will approve the document by a large majority. There will be work to do in order to make the European External Action Service (EEAS) able to actually perform the role it has been given by the new treaty and by the enthusiasm of the rapporteurs. The Service is not only a way to increase the European Union’s presence in various nations throughout the world; it also has a very important symbolic value, which is to express the unity of the 27 Member States. It is a natural consequence of the recognition of the EU’s legal personality. It is an incredibly important step towards the goal to be reached. The more votes cast in its favour, the further that step will carry us. I hope it will be reinforced even further by the establishment of a European Diplomatic Academy, and I would like to nominate the prestigious European University Institute in Florence to develop it.

),

It is very sad that for years now, the European Parliament has been unable to resolve a tragic contradiction. In every document in which measures to combat poverty, hunger and violence in the world are admirably proposed, some manage to include the declaration, whether direct or indirect, of the so-called right to abortion as a vehicle for the health and development of populations. The initiative of some is met, on the one hand, with the virtual indifference of the majority and, on the other, with a certain diffidence of the minority. Yet the contradiction and the tragedy are obvious. The principle of equal dignity for all human beings and that of special, rightful solidarity towards the youngest members of society are being abandoned at the very time when we are supposed to be pursuing the objective of combating discrimination and protecting health. This has also happened today in the case of the Cashman report, paragraph 42 of which, in contradicting the entire document, has forced myself and a number of MEPs to ultimately reject the report as a whole. When balanced against one another, in fact, the bad points that are being promoted unfortunately outweigh the good points present in other parts of the text. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Madam President, Mr López Garrido, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this membership is surely a sign of one of the European Union’s missions: the mission to defend and promote human rights. A mission that is already fully formulated and borne out by history, by the fact that individual Member States already belong to the European Council convention, by the reiteration that the general principles of the convention and Member States’ constitutions are now part of European law. So this symbolic gesture is extremely important. However, translating this ideal concept into substantive legal rules is not so simple: this report refers chiefly and ultimately only to institutional questions, and is completely acceptable. I must say that I also thank Mr Atondo, and am bound to report that the AFCO Committee on Constitutional Affairs – which I chair - has approved this document almost unanimously. We are therefore satisfied with this document, and I will not dwell on individual elements of it, because we fully support everything that the President of the Council and the Commissioner have said. I would like to make just one suggestion, since the statement about the institutional presence of European Members of Parliament within the European Council Parliamentary Assembly when meeting to appoint the judge and the judges is somewhat vague: I would say that there is a small problem with the relationship between the population of Europe, of the European Union, and the populations of other countries. Luckily, the regulation governing membership and representation in the European Council Parliamentary Assembly already states that there can be no fewer than two per State, and no more than 18 altogether. Given the importance of the European Union, I suggest that we should draw the line at 18. I must conclude, however, and so I will finish by saying that this resolution exposes a problem that it is worth examining in more depth, in other words, the problem that we have already highlighted many times of the relationship between the Courts. I believe we must reflect a little more upon this problem but, above all, on the problem of the European spirit: we are the European Union and, as stated in Article 2 of the Treaty of Lisbon, we are founded on human dignity and human rights – and equality is founded on human dignity. In Europe, we are not united on this point, and so we must reflect carefully on this concept of human dignity, its limits and what it covers. That is not the subject of this decision and this very welcome report, however. I thank the rapporteur. Carlo Casini  (PPE

I have cast my vote, which is categorically in favour of the two reports drafted by Mr Méndez de Vigo. I am satisfied for two reasons: the committee that I chair acted promptly, reaching a provisional agreement, and that agreement paved the way for the one reached today in plenary by a very large majority. From this perspective, I have endorsed the idea of voting against paragraph 5, introduced by an amendment of mine tabled in committee, to emphasise that the appointment of the 18 new Members will have to comply as far as possible with the provisions of the 1976 Electoral Act, which requires that Members be elected directly by the European citizens. Therefore, the preference will have to be for an automatic method that allows the candidates who received the most votes of those who were not elected during the last European elections to join Parliament. If, however, the national electoral system does not allow for such a calculation, we can resort to appointment by the national parliaments. Carlo Casini,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be very brief since the committee I chair reached a very comprehensive agreement, in line with what has already been said, and so there is no need to make the debate too long-winded. The problem which arose and was discussed in committee mainly concerned the following: both the Electoral Act of 1976 and the Treaty of Lisbon require Members of this Parliament to be directly elected by the peoples of the various nations. This is a problem for cases in which the electoral system used to elect MEPs for this parliamentary term does not allow entry into Parliament of candidates who did not obtain enough votes to secure a seat, but did obtain enough votes to allow their entry at a later date. Some electoral systems do allow this, but it appears that others do not. Therefore, if we do not wish to considerably delay the integration of the Members into Parliament, we should have recourse to exceptional, transitional appointment systems, as envisaged by the Council. Following lengthy discussions, my committee concluded that this is a fair position. We therefore support what has already been said. Indeed, I must say that I personally tabled an amendment proposing the appointment of observers for an interim period prior to the election of the new Members to this Parliament. Although this amendment is still under discussion, we shall have to vote against it – even if it is my amendment – since the compromise amendment provides for the swift, immediate integration of the MEPs into Parliament.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcomed the statements by Mr López Garrido and Mr Šefčovič. The new Treaty of Lisbon urges us to swiftly adopt a systematic course of action to promote the citizens’ initiative, which is testament to the existence of a European people. Indeed, it is a well-known fact that one of the harshest criticisms of the Union is that it is not a fully democratic structure. The Treaty of Lisbon has sought to reduce the democratic deficit in several ways, including by making provision for at least one million European citizens to submit a proposal for a legislative initiative. This new instrument, in order to be a serious tool, will have to produce legal effects of a certain importance. It certainly cannot have equivalent value to the pre-existing petitions which are signed by a wide range of individuals – a clear distinction must be made – and it must therefore be regulated in such a way as to prevent its abuse and still allow broad discussion, as the expression of informed and verifiable popular consensus. However, the most important aspect of the initiative laid down in Article 11 of the Treaty of Lisbon is its symbolic significance: the democratic deficit is being tackled not only by the decision-making power of the people’s representatives, but even more so by the very existence of a European people which is not just the mathematical sum of the citizens of the individual nations. Therefore, with regard to the rules we are considering, there are two aspects that I consider to be particularly important: the first concerns the subject matter, which must be – as someone already said – a European issue; the second is the distribution of the minimum number of signatories across a significant number of Member States, representing an appropriate percentage with respect to the electoral weight of each country. I hope that the new rules will help citizens of France, Italy, Germany, Spain and so on feel that they are, first and foremost, citizens of Europe. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 I voted against the resolution on equality between women and men in the European Union (2009), even though I agree with a great deal of its content, because we cannot call for equality for a certain category of people without denying it to another category of human beings. I refer to paragraph 38, which claims to guarantee women’s rights by ensuring them easy access to abortion. The destruction of the smallest and most defenceless individuals in the shape of unborn children cannot be considered a way of confirming women’s dignity and freedom. An anti-life conspiracy is at work, which uses tried and tested ways of deceiving us. We must reveal it for what it is. Putting together extremely fair requests with extremely unfair claims and twisting the meanings of words are stratagems that have proved effective during European Parliament votes, but I will have nothing to do with it. We cannot talk about the drama of abortion, which deserves the attention of politicians as well as moralists, without also recognising the rights of newborns or at least calling for proper education as far as respect for life is concerned and organising forms of support for difficult or unwanted pregnancies so that they can be allowed to reach their natural conclusions.

I should like to say how pleased I am, as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, about the agreement that has been reached on the principal lines of a new Framework Agreement between the Commission and Parliament. I must, however, make it clear that we need to think more deeply about the nature of the relationship between these two institutions. The outlook for democratic growth in the Union continues to be one in which Parliament is seen as representing the people and the Council as a sort of second chamber, representing the States. In such a context, the Commission should be considered as a government, and it is clear that this configuration would require rules that are considerably more detailed than the adjustments deservedly outlined today. I should like to add a thought on the citizens’ right of initiative. The relevant rules will have to be tailored to the effects that we consider must follow as a result. These effects must be considered in comparison with those stemming from the existing right of every citizen to submit a petition to the European Parliament and those connected to the limited powers of Parliament. Parliament has no power of initiative but it does have the power to request that the Commission initiate legislation. Carlo Casini  (PPE

With my emphatic vote in favour, I want to add greater force to the words spoken by President Barroso; words that gave notice of the construction over the next five years of a more united and stronger Europe. He began his speech by recalling the fundamental values of European unity, the most important of which is human dignity. I agree wholeheartedly, but the problem is that the word ‘dignity’ has become ambiguous, because it is used not only to guarantee life and human equality, but also to discriminate against and do harm to the most vulnerable members of society and even to justify death. I hope, therefore, that in the next five years, the Commission will work in such a way that the word ‘dignity’ will be restored to its unambiguous and true meaning. It is of symbolic importance that on 15 December last year, during the height of efforts to form the new Commission, 500 000 European citizens from 17 countries requested, in a collective petition, that our institutions interpret and implement the Charter of Fundamental Rights in every decision, on the basis of the equal dignity of every human being. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the principle of equality between women and men is part of the central current of the great river that has already freed foreigners, slaves, black people, and that is the principle of human dignity, the same for everyone. The Tarabella report and that of the Commission are therefore both commendable, because it is right to always insist thoroughly on this principle. There are, however, two critical remarks that I feel I should make. The flow of human dignity and equality should concern everyone, absolutely everyone, including those who are waiting to enter the world, unborn children. It is therefore unacceptable to do as point 38 of this report does, that is, to speak of abortion as an aspect of sexual reproductive rights, or women’s rights. No one is denying the complexity of problems where difficult and unwanted pregnancies are concerned – there are serious problems – but, in any case, these things should not be spoken about except in relation to the need to nurture respect for life and to offer mothers all kinds of help so that they can freely choose to continue with their pregnancy. My second criticism concerns the extension of the concept of sexual and reproductive health, as is done in recital X, beyond physical and mental aspects, to include social aspects as well. I wonder what it means that all sexual behaviour, whatever it may be, must receive from others justifications of wellbeing, and therefore recognition and praise. Does this not mean that we end up violating not only freedom of conscience, but also freedom of opinion? I will merely ask this question because I do not think it is a banal one. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in voting in favour of the joint resolution, I am highlighting the particular seriousness of the violence carried out in Malaysia in response to an exclusively nominalistic issue. Indeed, it is certain that both Christians and Muslims believe in only one God, who is the God of all men, believers and non-believers alike. The fact that He is referred to by different names is absolutely secondary. To claim that the Muslim God is only Muslim and can therefore be invoked only by Muslims, using a traditionally Muslim name, means returning to the ancestral and tribal view that there is a God for each group of human beings. In other words, it means contradicting the monotheistic idea that makes universal religions which, like Christianity and Islam, oppose idolatry and polytheism, great religions that are close to people. No less serious is the persecution of the Copts in Egypt. It was on the shores of the Mediterranean that monotheistic religions, which claim to be, and are, forces for promoting brotherhood and peace, were born. However, it is remarkable that it should be precisely on the shores of the Mediterranean, in Jerusalem – a holy city for those who believe in God, Allah and Jehovah – that the main breeding ground for conflict is found. It is precisely Egypt that is the most powerful country in the area, where Christians and Muslims must coexist peacefully in order to play a peacemaking role throughout the southern Mediterranean area.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for this Parliament, I am pleased that the Spanish Presidency attaches importance to the fulfilment of the structural reforms provided for by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in particular, with regard to the European External Action Service, to the Citizens’ Initiative, and to the European Union’s adherence to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, for which my committee has already appointed a rapporteur, the Spaniard, Mr Jáuregui Atondo, whom you already know. However, in an interview published in the Spanish newspaper, El País
, last Sunday, you expressed the wish, Mr Zapatero, that the law on religious freedom might result in Spain taking steps towards normalisation within all its public institutions. Thus, I would like, in this respect, to suggest that we reflect very briefly on the fact that Europe’s structures are a means of achieving an objective, and the European Union’s objective is confirmed in Article 2 of the Treaty of Lisbon: the promotion of dignity, equality, freedom and solidarity. I must therefore voice some concern about the direction in which this debate on values is heading. Cultural unity comes before economic unity. Europe’s spirit is stronger than the public – excuse me, judicial – structure. Europe’s spirit is rooted in the instinct for truth and beauty belonging to ancient Greece, in the cult of justice belonging to Rome, and on the basis of this extraordinarily great heritage it is Christianity that has added the value of human beings, always as equals from conception to natural death. Today, it is in the name of the Cross of Christ that we ask to go to Haiti, to be present in Haiti, because all human beings, and the poorest in particular, are at the heart of this. And so I ask you: what does ‘normalisation’ mean with regard to religious freedom? Does it mean perhaps preventing all citizens from publicly expressing their religion? Does it mean forgetting the roots, including the Christian roots, of our countries? Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the decision of the European Court of Human Rights has upset not only worshippers but also everyone who, for centuries, has viewed the crucifix as a sign of hope and solidarity, something providing solace and freedom from fear and pain. We hope that that decision will be modified by the Grand Chamber since it is clearly irrational. Should we do away with the very name of the Red Cross? Should we remove the huge crucifixes on mountain tops which tower over cities and valleys? Will it be prohibited for the Queen of England, as has already been mentioned, to be the head of the Anglican Church? Nevertheless, the case invites a very important reflection from a civil and political point of view: are human rights merely the rights of individuals, as parties isolated from a social environment, or is the right to express a specific form of piety also a right of the peoples? Do tradition, history, intelligence and art count for nothing when, for millennia, they have characterised a people’s identity? Furthermore, the question also rightly concerns the relationship between subsidiarity and human rights, and I note that the latter, aside from certain fundamental principles which must be considered universal and irrefutable, may be interpreted in different ways, and human rights may even conflict with each other. Why should a state be denied the chance, through its laws, to resolve these conflicts and to interpret and implement human rights according to the ethical views of its people? The issue therefore goes beyond the question of crucifixes. On other occasions, the European Court has recognised, with regard to the right to life, the exclusive power of the States to decide on the most controversial matters, such as the regulation of abortion and euthanasia. Now, the Treaty of Lisbon requires us to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights and consequently, as the European Union, also to respect the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights. Therefore, we ought to think about the new and different direction currently being taken by the Court. It would be a serious matter if a supranational power, especially if exercised by a limited number of people and not as the democratic expression of popular will, were to become repressive and demeaning, insensitive to people’s feelings and hearts and therefore ultimately opposed to freedom. This is why I hope that the resolution tabled by the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will be adopted with the votes of a large number of Members. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, the subject is an oral amendment to paragraph 131, on which I am in agreement with the other two rapporteurs, Mr López Aguilar and Mr Berlinguer. The current text states: ‘calls on the Council, the Commission and Member States to evaluate and review current international, European and national laws and policies on drugs and to promote harm reduction policies, notably with a view to the conferences on those issues held at UN level’. The oral amendment proposes inserting the words ‘prevention’ and ‘recovery’, meaning that the call to evaluate and review laws would concern ‘harm reduction, prevention and recovery policies’.

 Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution because it indicates the right way to strengthen European unity around the fundamental values that constitute its very identity. We cannot fool ourselves that it will be possible to achieve agreement on so-called common values. We may nevertheless hope that the application of reason can help the various political components to look more closely at what is right and fair where progressing along the road to European unity is concerned. The clear distinction between the right to free movement and the principle of non-discrimination, on the one hand, and the value of the family as a natural society founded on marriage, on the other, has led to the formulation of the paragraph that upholds the independence of individual States in family law and the ban on discrimination against any human being. Those who, like me, fully promote the principle of equality, affirming equality between children who are born and those who are not yet born, can only support the principle of non-discrimination against people with different sexual tendencies, but cannot accept the destruction of the concept of marriage or of the family. The significance of this concept, as recognised by Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is fundamental to the succession of generations and the educational capacities of heterosexual couples.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which I have the honour of chairing, gave me the task of acting as rapporteur on this document, together with the rapporteurs from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs, sitting jointly. This is the first time that Rule 51 of the Rules of Procedure has been applied and I must say that, in my view, the result has been very satisfactory with regard to the cooperation between the three rapporteurs in carrying out their work. There have, in fact, been problems, some of them serious, with regard to the timeframe and, above all, the involvement of the shadow rapporteurs and the timely translation of the amendments, of which there were nearly 500. However, all that is due not to Rule 51 itself, but rather to the very short deadlines that we gave ourselves in order to have a document that we could submit to the Council summit taking place on 10 December. It was thus inevitable that there would be these problems linked to the pace of work. For the rest, I believe that we should acknowledge that Rule 51, which has been used for the first time, is useful. The document under consideration by this Parliament cannot be explained in the few seconds that remain to me. However, I must express my satisfaction that the codecision system has been extended to become the normal system of legislation, that immigration is now understood to be a European issue – and I hope that this is how the Commission and the Council interpret it – and not a problem for individual Member States acting in solidarity with each other, that the view taken of cooperation with the national parliaments is not that they are guardians laying down limits, but rather positive collaborators in the legislative process, and finally, that there is that reference to human rights which is extremely important, and which is the spirit of the European Union. I therefore believe that, in view of the fact that it was not supposed to detail down to the finest particulars the implementation of the Stockholm Programme, but only to formulate general outlines, this document is certainly a positive step. There will be time and a way in which to make it more comprehensive, and to include more details. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we shall of course respect your decisions, but it is my understanding that there are some reservations about certain amendments, namely that they do not directly relate to the Treaty of Lisbon. I may be mistaken, but it seems to me that, until now, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has had general powers to make proposals concerning regulatory amendments. It can do this if the amendments are suggested by a group of Members, or by individual Members, and also on its own initiative. Therefore, the fact that the opportunity has been taken to make a few corrections, also with reference to other aspects, within the ambit of a wider reform of the Rules of Procedure under the Treaty of Lisbon cannot, in my view, be seen as unacceptable – all the more so since quite a few amendments would serve to reflect the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon in the Rules of Procedure, sometimes through rules that are reproduced technically and materially in them, but much more often through reference to the spirit of the treaty. One need only think of the role of Parliament, which has been strengthened in relation to the Council, but which is also being strengthened by the Rules of Procedure where the internal relationships with institutions within Parliament itself are concerned. We shall, of course, respect your decisions, Mr President, but I felt it was necessary to make these observations. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, first of all I wish to correct my first and second votes – I meant to abstain, but I made a mistake because I acted in haste and pressed the wrong button. My first two votes are abstentions from the whole day’s votes. The statement I am making is this: there is a grave original sin in the proposal that has led to today’s debate and it is a sin that has already been pointed out by the President of the Italian Republic. Added to this sin is the opportunism of choosing the Italian Prime Minister’s legal action against certain newspapers – a process that is clearly in full compliance with the rule of law – as a means by which to attack him. Therefore, we have not voted for the proposal by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, and so on, but nor have we voted for the motion by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) because, although it deserves recognition insofar as it safeguards Italy’s dignity, it totally overlooks the problem of the balance between the media and the other state powers, which exists in Europe and which is a serious problem in Italy too. This does not just concern the Italian Prime Minister’s conflict of interests in this area; it concerns other problems too. At national level, on the other hand, my party, the UDC, is continually challenging the majority on this. I believe that we, too, must send out a message of support by abstaining. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I all I feel it is my duty to thank the rapporteur, who has done a marvellous job, and, as chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I must also thank all of the members of the committee and of both committees – the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development – who delivered the opinion, for their very swift work. We have, in fact, tried to prepare a document – which I hope will be approved – that can be presented to the Council of 29 and 30 October. We are well aware that this report is not a definitive report. It is intended merely to point out a few courses of action, a path of some kind to follow, to the Council and thus to the High Representative who will be appointed. It will be the High Representative’s job to devise his own organisational plan which, in turn, will have to be examined by us. Therefore, it is only guidelines that are being submitted to our Parliament. We also know that the success of this operation regarding the External Action Service is linked to the role of the High Representative, who will have to be able to organise and manage everyone. Through him, we want a consistent and uniform foreign policy. We are well aware that there are problems, that much has already been said, but problems are there to be solved. The important thing is that the compass, the information, the scope is clear. The Brok report provides some interesting proposals in this regard – I have to be brief because my speaking time is up – but, in any case, they include the integration of the Service into the administrative structure of the Commission, the decision to further develop the Community model and the proposal, which is, moreover, laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, that the staff must be taken from the secretariats of the Commission and the Council and from the delegations of the Commission itself. There are two innovations that I believe are worth mentioning: Union embassies, headed by officials from the European External Action Service, which would also include the Commission delegations present in third countries and the Council liaison offices, with the possible secondment of experts from the Directorates-General; and the foundations that have been laid for the establishment of a European diplomatic college, which is an interesting idea. My speaking time has run out. I only hope that this report really is adopted, and adopted by a large majority. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to rationalise an apparently ambiguous feeling that I have after this first stage of the debate, because I fully subscribe to the strong words spoken by my chairman, Mr Daul, but I also subscribe to the words of Mr Sassoli who should, by all rights, be a political opponent of mine. Let me explain myself better: am I schizophrenic for having such ambivalent feelings, or am I trying unnecessarily to reconcile the fact that, in Italy, I sit on the opposition benches while, here, I find myself next to the People of Freedom party, in the People’s Party? I feel I can answer that by highlighting an obvious contrast between the scope and the importance of the subject of freedom of information, which is a very important subject… Were Montesquieu alive today, he would have spoken not only of legislative, executive and judicial powers, but of other powers too, and he would have put the fourth power, the press, in first place, as it represents a problem of freedom, of the fight against mental slavery, and a problem of democracy. On the other hand, the straw that broke the camel’s back after months and months of barbarisation of the entire Italian press – let it be said – of the right and of the left; the quality of the Italian press has been poor for months now because politics really has reached a low point – was Mr Berlusconi’s legal action. Please indulge me: I was a criminal judge for four years in the Fifth criminal division of the Court of Cassation, where we judged the crime of libel. This is how I know Mr Mauro is right: I saw many of these actions for libel, and no one protested. Citizens have the right to defend themselves in these situations too. I therefore hope that, by making a genuine attempt to reconcile seemingly opposing points, we will actually come up with a new and better way of tackling the problem for the whole of Europe and not just in regard to Italy. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, I was also told I had three minutes, but I will try to stay within two minutes. I would like to join many of my fellow Members in expressing my satisfaction. I think that it is now time to put into effect, to implement the Treaty of Lisbon as soon as the ratifications take place, something which we hope will happen imminently. The committee which I chair has been doing everything in its power for some time now but, above all, it is important for Parliament to be aware of its new responsibilities: it must not allow the de facto 
loss of any aspect of its wider legislative functions. I would, however, like to highlight one issue which I do not think has been raised so far: there were many reasons why the Irish people previously rejected the Treaty, but one was the fear, among some voters, that the European legal system could violate, in Ireland. certain fundamental values concerning the right to life and the notion of family. These fears were allayed through declarations adopted by the European Councils of December 2008 and June 2009. I think this is important not just for Ireland, but for the whole of Europe. It was clarified, in fact, that the acquis communautaire
 does not concern the area relating to the right to life and the family. This clarification does not apply solely to Ireland, but to all the Member States. In reality, there was no need to clarify this because in various judgments involving France, the United Kingdom and Poland, the European Court of Human Rights had already ruled that in the areas of life, the value of life, respect for life and the family, it must be left up to the Member States to decide according to their history, tradition and culture. However, Ireland’s attention to detail had the merit of formally clarifying this point which, as I was saying, now applies to the entire European Union. I believe that this is a good thing, which makes holding the double referendum worthwhile. Naturally, we know full well that European culture consists of the sum of the cultures of all of the countries that make it up, and we all want Europe to be not just an economic area but also, and above all, a community of values. I therefore think it proper that we show Ireland both our satisfaction and our gratitude for everything that it offers Europe in terms of its history and its ideals. Europe needed Ireland, not only for technical reasons relating to its mechanisms and organisational structure, but also for Ireland’s contribution to what we are all seeking: the essence of Europe.

My judgment on the motion for a resolution on the protection of minors in Lithuania is intended to demonstrate a very serious institutional concern. Often, individual MEPs or political groups claim to address issues that relate to the domestic policy of individual States: that does not seem right. In the case in point, the plan is seemingly to make the European Parliament express an essentially negative opinion on a Lithuanian law – the full content of which is unknown – with the laudable aim of protecting minors, while surreptitiously imposing a position that the individual Member States have been left to establish at their own discretion. This, I might add, is something which the European Court of Human Rights has stipulated on many occasions. The principle of equality is beyond doubt, and no one is trying to call into question the dignity of persons with particular sexual orientations. My reservation is of an institutional nature because it concerns the relations between the European Union and individual Member States. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 While, in non-EU countries caught up in the current crisis, the fight for growth and jobs is being met with economic and financial leverage – whether legal or monetary – under the control of a single political and administrative body, in Europe, we continue to endure political delays from an EU that still cannot overcome the issue of unitary governance. This situation is aggravated by the fact that, despite the major ongoing effort to strengthen coordination between Member States on their own budgets, conclusive action to coordinate tax systems is still excluded from political debate, especially in respect of the direct taxation system. This delay produces tax competition that could also be construed as dumping, which has a negative impact, especially on the stability of businesses, including geographically, and risks, above all, affecting areas that are already weak and corporate social responsibility. This is why I regret the failure to adopt the part of the amendment that highlighted the risks of tax competition, to the detriment of consolidating national budgets, and, to this end, suggested the introduction of a minimum rate of corporate taxes. I hope that we can make up for this delay in the near future. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 The ongoing global crisis has made clear the lack of political involvement in supra-national economic governance, especially in the European Union. When, way back in 1988-1989, European leaders took the brave decision to begin convergence of the Member State economies with a view to the single currency, both by completing the internal market and by coordinating the Member States’ economies, it was made very clear, from a pro-EU point of view, that this objective could only be fully achieved by twinning the pillar of monetary governance, under an autonomous European Central Bank, with the pillar of economic governance exercised by Commission, Council and Parliament. Only the two pillars together could underpin the future of the European Union. However, this sharing of responsibilities has to be combined with the sharing of opportunities and economic results. Just as, at the national level, varying rates of regional economic growth are balanced out by single-state governance, including by joint participation in the public debt, the same should happen at European level in relations between Member States, which should evolve, making shared, cooperative and reciprocal destinies a reality. I think that this report and the amendments that have been adopted are in line with this view. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 A local authority has the utmost political autonomy when it achieves total control on tax matters, and therefore has total economic and financial control over deciding its budget. Unfortunately, the serious delay in achieving this level of autonomy is particularly clear with regard to the agreement on the multiannual financial framework. During this very process, European and pro-European ambitions and responsibilities clash with the selfishness of the Member States, resulting in increased national and nationalist sentiment. It is regrettable that the political mentality that always made the common European interest a priority has been lost, replaced by an accountant’s mentality where what is given to the European budget and what is received nationally under ‘community’ policies are continually set off against one another. The EU will only reach its full political potential by boosting its powers on budgets and taxing genuine own resources, including through eurobonds and a financial transaction tax, and boosting its resources, so that they are suited to meet the challenges and political objectives that it aims to pursue and achieve. It seems to me that this joint resolution is heading in that direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

The global financial crisis, which began to show itself in 2008, is, unfortunately, far from over. Instead, in some ways, with productive sectors now weakened by the period we have gone through, it seems even more serious and now might become structural within economic systems. On the other hand, even the repeated and numerous recurrences of the original causes of the crisis demonstrate that the ‘market’ is not an abstract entity that can regulate itself efficiently, as experts in the new welfare economy would still have us believe, but that it is, instead, a system managed by a few individuals worldwide who, often unscrupulously, attack financial markets, productive systems and institutions with the hope of profiting from their weakening or even from their failure. The actions taken by each individual country are not enough to address this global crisis. What we need are decisions made at an equal level. The financial transaction tax would be useful in mitigating the devastating effects of raider activity, especially if it were adopted globally and if it did not impact on national bonds or pension funds. Meanwhile, and in the hope that this might happen, it is important that it should start, at least, with the European dimension. This report and the amendments adopted are in line with this outlook.

The globalisation of the economy has led to the need to step up economic cooperation between the EU and other areas of the world. This aim needs to be pursued not only through various fundamental principles that make trade balances sustainable, although these are, of course important, but, above all, through support for the EU’s production systems, to make them more competitive on the world stage. It is therefore necessary for both the principle of legal and economic/financial reciprocity and the anti-dumping principle to always be an integral part of economic agreements, with particular reference to the fiscal and social security dimensions, so that a correct approach may be taken based on the comparative and competitive advantages of enterprises and production systems. In addition, it is necessary for the principle of reciprocity to permeate access to Chinese public procurement. Finally, the EU ought to take a more farsighted and attentive approach to investments in developing countries, made also by competing countries, such as China, in order to better evaluate the impact of these interventions in political, economic, social and environmental terms. I believe that the report we have adopted seeks to achieve these objectives. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 The social dimension of our communities – particularly small and medium-sized ones – is more significant than their economic weight. In this vein, I would like to underline that some essential services, such as those relating to people’s health, the environment (including the water and waste cycles) and local public transport, should be thought of as directly connected to fundamental human rights. This is because they can be defined, in political terms, as public goods and services, even if they are managed by private entities. Making them more efficient, effective and economical, while pursuing increased and higher quality standards is another thing. Moreover, denying access to many sections of the population, especially the most vulnerable and neediest, whenever we apply the rules of the market plain and simple to these sectors is something else entirely. That is why, given their special status and social relevance, in the next reform being drawn up, we must retain a precise distinction between the rules that regulate State aid for services of general economic interest and the rules that govern other forms of State aid. The adopted report partly upholds this view. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 Different rates of development and the changes in the ways of life that exist in our societies have led to profound variations in the demographic pyramid. If higher life expectancy is a positive aspect of these changes, the same could not be said for others, in particular, for those that concern young people and women. With regard to these categories of the population, elements that have been shown to be inadequate include work policies that have put a strain both on training (including at university and post university), in favour of a more pronounced trend towards entering the world of work, and on accompanying policies concerning remaining in work, with a view to greater fulfilment of family needs. To this end, among the initiatives to be reinforced by more profitable use of Structural Funds, one could, on the one hand, include the provision of services in support of guidance and of satisfying the demand for work with job offers, whereby these services are adequate, operational and easily accessible to those who require them. On the other hand, one could intervene by strengthening policies in support of the family (including greater diffusion of public or private nurseries and organisation of flexible work). I believe that the approved report leads in this direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 Economic, social and territorial cohesion policy is one of the fundamental pillars on which our coexistence within the EU is based, as it promotes growth in areas struggling to develop in order to enable them to converge and compete fairly against more developed areas. The experience acquired also during the current programming period shows that delays in development are effectively recouped on the one hand by simplifying rules and procedures, while maintaining a rigorous pursuit of objectives, and, on the other, by strengthening the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of management and control systems. All this has to take place within the context of the broad and effective involvement of all the institutional, economic and social partnerships at the various local levels in order to identify the strategies and specific and operational objectives to be pursued. In addition to this, there needs to be effective programming and unified implementation by the different EU (structural, agricultural and neighbourhood policy funds) and national funds, recognising in project funding the capacity for integration of the various areas and production and the different private and public entities, including in a cross-border, inter- and intra-regional context. I believe that the report that I helped to approve contains these suggestions. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

Food security is a prerequisite for achieving balanced development at all levels. Its relationship with sustainable production in the primary sector can be seen in a number of different ways. In environmental terms, it is expressed through the use of eco-friendly techniques and products and through a non-speculative enhancement and management of the immense natural resources that are found in developing countries in particular. In economic terms, it is expressed partly by enhancing the competitive advantages between the various areas and countries – which can also enable developing countries to play an integral role in balanced and global growth – and partly by promoting the link with the land through a focus on locally sourced products, where energy costs and pollution linked to transport and the quality and tradition of the products can be better protected. In social terms, the processes of gradual urbanisation and population growth, above all, in developing countries, have to be reconciled with the needs of living in these places. Lastly, in political terms, because the primary and food sectors represent the most tangible, daily platform for relations between people, including in their relationships with institutions. I believe that the report we have adopted upholds this view. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 Economic cooperation, including trade cooperation, is one of the instruments through which foreign policy is implemented. The European Union is founded, first, on sectoral trade and, second, on the wider single market: a foundation that is still suffering from the lack of a single foreign policy; a wide-ranging, strong and authoritative policy that helps to define strategic positions on economic cooperation with other countries and geopolitical regions, as well. This situation allows each Member State to develop in an independent and uncoordinated fashion, either on its own or in the various international organisations to which it belongs. In order to ensure that the Doha negotiations have a favourable outcome, while also reiterating the usefulness of the World Trade Organisation as a forum for solving the problems of balanced development and cohesion among all the member countries, we need to work on integrating the other countries, too, into long-term policies, firstly by building on their competitive advantages, and secondly by strengthening their ability to shape their own development.

 Economic, social and territorial cohesion policy is one of the fundamental pillars of an EU that is in favour of bridging gaps in the development of geographical areas and sectors of society and the economy. If correctly focused on people and bottom-up subsidiarity, it allows the promotion of integrated, systemic growth, stimulating initiative and civic sense and fostering the development of responsibility and the common good. The experience of the current 2007-2013 programming period has taught that in the next programming period we need above all to give greater responsibility to the actors, beneficiaries and targets of strategic and operational programming, as well as to its implementation, monitoring and the assessment of whether objectives have been met, through programmes providing incentives and disincentives to encourage the meeting of targets and allowing greater transparency in the processes and work involved in active participation in them. It is also important to make the entire structure of governance and management simpler and more flexible, and to foster the capacity for integration of the different territories in a cross-border, inter- and intra-regional sense. Finally, it is necessary for the resources and objectives of cohesion policy in the next programming period to be in line with the challenges the EU will be undertaking, including the EU 2020 strategy. I think that the report I helped to approve shows the right way to do this. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

The internal market, competition policy and fundamental freedoms have accompanied the growth of an open and integrated Europe. The economic vision that led to its creation in the beginning is not the only dimension of a political reality that intends to take part in governing globalisation. This contains other dimensions which generate shared visions and policies which have to make people the focus of their attention. This change of approach makes it even more important to encourage the creation of an economic and social context in which the need to develop one’s own identity and the response to the fundamental needs of daily life and future prospects are what drive public actions. In this context social services of general interest take on a bigger, different role in which the financial aspect, in terms of budget compatibility and medium- and long-term sustainability, play a important part, but only in the context of the primary objective of developing human beings and quality of life in a family, social, working and institutional sense.

 Economic, social and territorial cohesion policy is one of the fundamental pillars of an EU that is conscious not only to promote and develop excellence by encouraging innovation, but also to create convergence and bridge the gaps of and in less developed areas compared with more advanced ones. Joint programming was the most innovative aspect of the period 2007-2013, having led the regions and the Member States to adopt an integrated approach between territories and resources as part of their strategic and operational programming. However, this important approach is liable, in many cases, to be frustrated by the considerable autonomy and strong competition existing between the various authorities in charge of managing each monofund programme. By failing to work together properly, they seriously endanger not only the valuable integration of operations and actions that could be achieved, but also the benefits and the impact that those actions could create. In the next programming period, then, it may be worth reverting to multifund programmes, incorporating in them the experience gained from joint programming and encouraging shared and responsible management between the various stakeholders in charge of regional development. I believe that the adopted report makes an effective contribution to these objectives. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 The agricultural sector still plays a strategic role today in our societies and economies. It does so firstly from a food perspective, since not only does it provide the raw materials for food, but the safety of that food is essential for our health. It does so secondly from an environmental perspective, since the vitality of the sector and the quality of its production processes make for environmentally friendly land management. It does so thirdly from a social perspective, since it represents a challenge to provide high-quality, innovative jobs for young people. It does so fourthly and finally from an economic perspective, since a local/global approach allows for the economic development of traditional, high-quality, certified and high added value products, through the adoption of management models that turn businesses and their products into competitive cooperatives on a global scale. A fair CAP that promotes micro, small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises and high-quality, traditional and certified products, that supports environmentally friendly processes, that introduces aid ceilings and that sets aside sufficient resources for rural development is an ambitious and far-sighted policy that benefits citizens, consumers and agricultural operators. I believe that the adopted report offers this possibility. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

One of the fundamental objectives of the European Union is to link human and social development to economic development. If these two factors are in balance, then this means, on the one hand, that people can do their work with adequate remuneration that is in line with human dignity and professional quality, while, on the other hand, it allows business owners to develop their businesses by following market principles, though tempered by the human environment in which this must take place. This perspective – which some people also call the social market economy – is actually a new paradigm that goes beyond welfare economics and returns instead to the centrality of the human being. Such a paradigm shift necessarily involves consistent support for social policy, including fostering the relevant standards and related corporate responsibility. This approach and vision cannot, and must not, have an impact merely within the EU, but must also be applied to external action wherever possible, particularly during the negotiation of agreements. Respect for International Labour Organisation standards, the principles laid down in the European Social Charter and social dialogue are just some of the areas that can be discussed on these occasions. I believe that the report we have adopted offers sound backing for these objectives. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

Indicators are a concise way of interpreting a given phenomenon. Simple phenomena can be interpreted using simple indicators, while complex phenomena require complex indicators. Gross domestic product is a simple indicator, while development is a complex phenomenon. Indeed, the economic development of an area has various dimensions that are not included in GDP, which takes a snapshot of a given moment. Other elements of interpretation are totally neglected, such as investment in intangible infrastructure, including know-how (people, processes and products, to mention just a few examples), and investment in tangible infrastructure, including communication and transport networks (ICT networks and road and rail networks, for example). In addition, GDP is not even suitable for identifying regions assisted by EU regional cohesion policy. For these reasons, the European Commission’s efforts to go beyond GDP and create a series of data and indicators that will improve its ability to interpret phenomena and help to better define policies and financial allocations should be commended. The report that we have adopted seems to me to be moving in this direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 The economic and financial crisis has highlighted the total lack of ethics in this area. The paradigm of the new welfare economy, whereby the pursuit of individual wellbeing is the key to collective welfare, which is the sum of its parts, is apparent in all its inadequacy. According to this approach, individual interest does not set any limitation on the collective interest, let alone the general interest. Yet because public government must set general interest as a framework within which to operate, and provide free space for freedom and individual rights within it, it must support this with a fair and progressive tax system. Consistent with this approach, which must be supported at global level by the EU and all G8 and G20 countries, the revenue from financial transactions must be made comparable to other revenues through a specific tax system that favours greater responsibility by operators together with other rules and new paradigms. The introduction of Eurobonds designed for the crisis fund and infrastructure projects could strengthen the EU’s ability to take action if they were additional to the EU budget. The report that we have adopted seems to me to be moving, albeit slowly, in this direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 Agriculture represents a strategic sector for the European Union. While its impact in terms of employment and GDP may not equal that of other sectors, it assumes greater significance with regard to the characteristics of our respective regions and food traditions, since it ensures that we are self-sufficient in many ingredients that are essential for our farm produce, traditional or otherwise. Furthermore, this sector plays a fundamental role in safeguarding and protecting the environment and ensuring the sustainable development of our regions. It is obvious that trade agreements have to be made, particularly in the trade rounds of the World Trade Organisation. For that to happen, however, the European Union has to pay more attention to safeguarding quality, traditional and certified products, so that they can be protected internationally to avoid fraud on foreign markets involving products that have been falsely attributed to our countries. The basic tenet of the approved report seems to go in the right direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the proposed text because pensions are one of the fundamental institutions of the system of worker’s rights and duties. They are essential for the continuation of a decent standard of living for the people concerned and for their whole families, especially when it comes to receiving adequate support so as to attain a decent standard of personal and family life. By setting this threshold as a long-term goal, it is obvious that sustainable pension systems are necessary to offer certain minimum prospects to workers. While I respect the principle of bottom-up subsidiarity, with primary authority and responsibility for adequacy and opportunity for reform lying with the Member States, there is a need for convergence of pension systems in Europe, so as to ensure full and genuine freedom of movement for workers and enterprises and also full and mutual recognition and parity of the various pension systems within the Member States. Indeed, while I acknowledge the differences in the cost of living and in wage levels between Member States, there is a need to establish long-term convergence both internally within each Member State and within the EU as a whole, so as to promote a decent and adequate level of life expectancy.

The internal market and competition policy are two cornerstones of the process of European unification which aim not only at strengthening the European Union’s economy and its businesses but, above all, at realising the fundamental freedoms of the Union. This objective must be pursued in the interests of all European citizens and enterprises, offering equal opportunities and substantial equality while avoiding problems, additional costs and superstructures that could differentiate, discriminate between or limit the opportunities to enjoy or protect one’s own rights. Giving all European Union citizens the right to express themselves in their own language in dealings with the EU institutions is a fundamental right in terms of equality, equal opportunities and non-discrimination. The use of just some of the official languages can technically only be justified within the activities of the EU institutions and not in its relations with citizens, enterprises and institutions in the Member States. Enhanced cooperation procedures are useful when they increase the opportunities for those that participate in them, without compromising them for the others. I therefore voted against the recommendation since I think enhanced cooperation is unacceptable in such a delicate context as the political equality of languages, as it would create discrimination in terms of the right of equal opportunity to access the EU’s fundamental freedoms.

Humanitarian aid now has a larger and more important role than in the past. Differing rates of development and growing inequality in opportunity and resource distribution in geographical, social and generational terms, increasing climate change (for which humans are partly to blame) and the associated increase in natural disasters, increased environmental pollution, imbalanced anthropic pressure concentrated in large urban areas, and uneven population growth in some areas of the planet, have led to a rising number of humanitarian disasters in which aid takes on an essential role in restoring basic living conditions and human dignity. In view of this, if humanitarian aid is needed to assist people hit by disasters, then in turn, any interventions as a result of EU foreign policy – which is still to be defined – cannot be apportioned according to each Member State’s areas of interest and influence, but should take on a European dimension.

 Agriculture plays a key role in the development of communities. Defining its output as a primary sector in economic terms relates not only to the historical trend of its development, but also, and above all, to its role in stabilising societies and their economies. Balanced agricultural production has to be attentive not only to the quantities produced, but also, and primarily, to the quality of the output, so that it assists in the healthy development of the population. From this perspective, therefore, food security plays a key role, and its protection – particularly in terms of traditional and local produce – increases the opportunities for development throughout the territory. The positive correlation between food security and the quality and healthiness of agricultural products also involves increasing their eco-friendliness, while particular care must be paid to the domino effect caused by the uncontrolled introduction of genetically modified organisms, in order to provide, in the first instance, the necessary certainties as regards the medium- and long-term effects that these products could have on health and local economies.

Greater courage in formulating proposals for the efficient use of EU resources that make it possible to achieve binding objectives and concrete benchmarks; 4. effective and incisive EU governance of the economy and finance, as well as financial participation of employees in the success of the company that allow more widespread, balanced and inclusive economic and social development.

 The Stockholm Programme is an essential next step in the development of the European area of freedom, security and justice towards a greater focus on individuals. A greater focus that contributes not only to a more comprehensive perspective on citizenship, including respect for human beings and human dignity, but also to a perspective on the law and on justice that makes it accessible throughout the Union, so that individuals can exert their rights without any internal borders. A focus on individuals that must be guaranteed across the board, including as regards the growing phenomenon of immigration and asylum, albeit in strict compliance with the rules on civil harmony, including security. The Commission Action Plan is a consistent embodiment of the Stockholm Programme. When developing European areas of freedom, security and justice, however, respect must always be shown for the principle of subsidiarity, which encourages respect for individuals and for the traditions that form an integral part of their history.

 The ongoing economic and financial crisis, in severely affecting the economies of the ‘developed’ countries of the West, has shown that the economic paradigm of the efficiency and capacity for self-regulation of the markets is no longer based on reality, because reality has called for all economic and market players, especially financial market players, to act responsibly and ethically, something which they have completely failed to do in recent times. The disruption caused in financial terms to the entire economy shows that the industrial sector requires a huge amount of support, since it is still a sector of fundamental importance for the economy, especially the real economy. When taking into account the competitive and comparative advantages and disadvantages between regions, especially at international level, we must not forget that the mining industry is present in areas in which the development of sound economic and occupational alternatives should be encouraged as a preliminary step and in which welfare support provisions should be enhanced to prevent painful increases in unemployed workers whom it is difficult to redeploy.

The role of rural development is essential to keep our territories alive, both because of its end product and because it is so widespread. Seen in this context, the livestock sector is one of the most significant for our communities. Indeed, beyond food and economic aspects (though important, and in which regard the quality of the products is ensured by environmentally sustainable techniques), farming represents the most widespread form of occupation, protection and development of rural areas. This is why the European Union – including through the common agricultural policy, above all, in its post-2013, reformed incarnation – and each Member State must promote its continued existence, not only by coming up with innovative techniques for farming and economically and environmentally sustainable management, but also by strengthening their wider role as guardians of the environment and the land protecting them from the market crisis by reducing production costs, making the best of their products and greater organisation on the market.

Justice in relations between generations represents the new global challenge that needs to be adequately tackled. Modern societies have found themselves presiding over a period of constant growth in which, above all in the last few decades, new generations have had better conditions and prospects ahead of them than previous generations. Now, the situation has surpassed the limits of seemingly endless growth and we find ourselves faced with a debate between rights and limited resources. All countries, beginning with the developed and democratic ones and their related organisations (like the EU), must therefore work determinedly, conclusively and cogently to work out policies, make choices and implement them coherently for a greater equilibrium between current and future generations, so that the division and distance between those with rights and those without, and those with resources and those without, may be reduced.

The vote for a legislative motion for a resolution amending Directive 92/85/EEC was taken not only to support new and better measures for the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding but also, more generally, to support new measures to promote a better work-life balance. Even though the Italian legal system is more innovative, the increase in the number of weeks of maternity leave at European level represents a strong boost in favour of family assistance to newborn babies. The support for paternity leave is also a step in the same direction even though making this compulsory is not perhaps the best way to pursue the laudable aim of ensuring the greater effective presence of both parents at the most demanding time for the new household and ensuring the father is more aware and involved. Support for and extension of the rights of adopted children allows a reinforcement and, it is to be hoped, also a simplification of the adoption process.

 Late payments in commercial transactions between undertakings, and between undertakings and public authorities, are one of the things currently hampering the recovery of economic growth. Approval of the new directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions represents a major innovation that will require appropriate preparation, above all, of the public sector, in both political and administrative terms. In political terms, so that financial and budgetary planning can take account not only of the impact of European Union rules on the Stability and Growth Pact, but now also of the impact of the new rules on late payments, which, if not satisfactorily managed, could have both a direct and reflex effect on the room for manoeuvre of governments at various levels. In administrative terms, appropriate preparation is required for the correct financial management of public bodies, beginning with the ratio between liabilities and expenditure, so that tax revenues and, hence, the people, are not weighed down by burdens such as interest payments which could have a significant effect on public finances. Finally, it seems important for there to be particular awareness and flexibility regarding several sectors, such as the health sector, in which the public authorities have run up significantly late payments owed to undertakings, for regular goods and services provided.

 In the vote on the report by Mrs Gallo on the enforcement of intellectual property rights in the internal market, two mutually complementary rights have been reconciled. One is the particular intellectual property right of the author and/or editor of the item created, and the other is the more general right to knowledge of the users of the item itself. The European Union cannot only be an internal market, where businesses operate and protect the goods and services they provide, but it is also a shared space of citizenship and freedom, in which citizens can express and inform themselves and each other. Making everything bow to private interests, creating excessive, unjustified and unfair limits to the free dissemination of the creations of the intellect could unduly compromise the shared space, where the expression of thought takes on the significance of a public asset. Hence, it is important that intellectual creations are protected, but it is just as important that the methods of their protection are not excessive in order to make them fully available, as easily and quickly as reasonably possible, to the entire community, beginning with the Internet community.

A common foreign policy and a common economic policy are the necessary objectives of the European integration process. It should be remembered that the single currency was also chosen to speed up the integration process, which had come to a standstill in Nice. Given the way in which it is being organised, the European External Action Service is in danger of adopting a paralysing ‘do nothing’ approach, rather than being the start of a virtuous unifying process.

 This proposal for a regulation is blazing a legislative trail on a subject that is fundamental for European Union citizens and enterprises, namely the transparency and dissemination of information on food products. While, on the one hand, it is important to achieve an internal market where all citizens and all enterprises can make the best possible choices, on the other hand, we must take into account the extraordinary heritage of food, wine and gastronomic culture that moulds the traditions of many parts of Europe, thus benefiting health and also economic, social and environmental sustainability. During the process of amending the proposal, both in detail and in broad terms, it has become apparent that the European Parliament, in performing this function so fundamental to the exercising of its responsibilities, is turning into a place where the interest of multinationals are transacted to the detriment of consumers. When faced by this inequality of power, which should be balanced out by the pursuit of public interest by the institution, we can only marvel at the growing public disinterest in the process of European integration. These observations are not motivated by national interests but by the judiciousness of preserving typical local food products and the strong local bond between producers and consumers.Carlo Casini,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution that we will vote on contains three points, as the Commissioner has underlined. The first deals with bringing forward the date of the elections: the proposal is aimed at ensuring that the Commission will be in a position to start work at the end of the summer. We must verify whether this is feasible – as the Commissioner has pointed out – to ensure that the date chosen will affect turnout positively rather than negatively. I believe that the most important proposal, however, is for nominations by the political parties of candidates for the Commission Presidency, and I prefer to speak of ‘political parties’ here rather than ‘political families’, precisely in order to underline the need for the creation of genuine European political parties. This is very important if Europe is to capture the imagination of the European electorate. The declining turnout is due also to the fact that during the European elections various national rather than European matters are discussed. The European elections are seen as nothing more than a test of the domestic political situation. During the election campaign we must talk about Europe, and the citizens must be firmly convinced that their votes count for something in terms of European policies. I think that nominating candidates for the Commission Presidency would help to convince the citizens of this. Europe will certainly be discussed more than in the past in these upcoming elections, because the economic crisis has focused attention on the basic debate of whether there should be more Europe, less Europe or even an end to Europe. It is absolutely essential to give citizens the opportunity to choose the government of Europe and the President of the Commission. The third question has to do with the make-up of the Commission, apart from the question of gender balance: we are debating whether it might not be better for a quota of future Commissioners, established in numerical terms or in some less determined manner, to be drawn from among MEPs. This would also give the electorate the feeling that their vote makes a difference. For these reasons, I think that we should support the resolution. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 The continued insistence on calling for European documents against homophobia demonstrates that the true objective is different from the apparent one. The principle of equality of all human beings, their dignity and the consequent need to respect everyone’s freedom regardless of their sexual orientation is an accepted fact, on which all parliamentarians agree. It is reasonable, therefore, to suppose, as indeed is clear from the resolution in question, that the objective pursued by the emphatic rejection of homophobia is to make same-sex marriage acceptable. It is implicit in the text that there is an aspiration to educate children to consider a same-sex relationship as having the same value as marriage, as the foundation of the family and therefore of the state, as recognised by Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We must not confuse the duty to guarantee freedom for all citizens with the state’s promotion of and support for what constitutes its foundation. On this point, educational and cultural aspects play a fundamental role and we must therefore oppose a misguided line of action that will result in public harm. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Article 6 should be implemented and it should be implemented soon, because it is a legal obligation that is required of us. The committee that I am honoured to chair has worked quickly and I would like to thank Mr Guerrero Salom and my fellow Members who worked on this. A contact group has also been set up between the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly and Parliament and I think this link should be reprised once again. We now call upon Mr Bødskov and Mr Kallas to pick up the pace and come to conclusions. I will not hide the problems, which are not structural – since you might say that we have already resolved those – but certainly substantial and procedural. They, however, can only be resolved in practice, once the Union has acceded to the Convention. In terms of the substance, there is one particular issue. As far as I know, this is the only case in the world in which a declaration, a legally binding act on human rights, applies to a territory where there is another legal act – the Convention of the Council of Europe – which contains the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This certainly poses a few problems, especially in procedural terms: who will have the last word? That is the major problem, but we cannot resolve it now. Meanwhile, let us get on with accession. The solution will emerge from case law, probably using the principle that the European Court of Human Rights applies, whereby all other remedies must already have been attempted before recourse may be made to the Court. In this sense, the European Court of Human Rights could be the court of last instance, even after the Court of Justice of the European Union.

Equality between women and men is an undeniable achievement of the modern era. Its foundations are equal human dignity and universal recognition of human rights. Unfortunately, in the report we are discussing today, there is an unacceptable contradiction that radically changes its meaning. Human dignity and human rights concern all human beings and therefore also the most fragile, weak and poor. Demanding abortion as a woman’s right, hiding this request in a misleading fashion in a question on sexual and reproductive rights (which in itself is worthy of full consent, provided that they do not include the right to destroy the life of an unwanted child) is unacceptable. For this reason I cannot vote in favour of the report. I would like to add that equality between men and women does not mean having the same identity and that motherhood is the sign of a capacity for receptivity (what may be called ‘feminine genius’) that man does not have. In that sense, women can walk at the head of all humanity towards goals of freedom, justice, peace and solidarity. But, to be themselves, they must not walk alone, but rather accompany all the weakest people on Earth, starting off from their own children. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not able to go into detail about the three issues raised by the Commission. I believe that these issues should be seriously looked into. However, I am sure that there has been lengthy discussion on the matter by my Committee on Constitutional Affairs, when the constitution had not yet been approved and there was already criticism of it, for reasons that people are too afraid to voice. Firstly, because there is the reference …  (The President cut off the speaker) Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Many of the speeches in our long debate have been rather generic. It has not been clearly shown which provisions of the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights have been violated by Hungary, or which precise provision of Hungarian law should be censured. Only the Commission has indicated three more precise areas for investigation. I believe that in this regard we need to have faith in the Commission and in the Hungarian Government and Parliament. However, there is an underlying issue that needs to be brought to light. Attacks continue to be made on the Hungarian Constitution, but no one has the courage to indicate the real reasons why a certain European radical left-wing is supporting a campaign of denigration against a country which has great merit in the fight for democracy and freedom. What is disturbing about the Hungarian Constitution is the reference to Christian roots, recognition of human dignity from the moment of conception, and statement that the family is a natural state based on marriage between a man and a woman. I do not believe that these three aspects conflict with European values. In fact they are an exemplary description of the foundations of such values, which should be taken as a model by all of European law. Carlo Casini,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to thank all those who worked on this text, starting with the working group, in which all the leading members of the parties present in this House met, but also my committee, which did some valuable work on this issue. I believe that we need a very broad consensus to demonstrate that this Parliament is a transparent parliament, that it is concerned only with the common good, and that each one of us is personally honouring the commitment, made back at the time of the elections, to serve only the common good and European integration. Hence, I believe that there should be a very broad consensus, which is why I would ask Mr Gargani to withdraw his oral amendments; although they are worded very well, they would prevent this broad consensus from being reached. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the people are the foundation of democracy. ‘People’ means identity, a combination of history, traditions and ideals, but it also means unity and the desire to have a single government. On that basis, a single electoral system is clearly an instrument for building a population, a European demos
. This European demos
 still does not fully exist, as demonstrated by the fact that in the last European elections there was a much lower turnout and hence a lack of responsiveness, and by the fact that national debates have focused primarily on national problems and not on European problems. The proposals made in the Treaty of Lisbon should therefore be implemented. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament is not obliged to present or draft a uniform electoral law; the Treaty merely indicates that it has the power to do so, but it is an extraordinarily important power, and therefore we must not abandon our plan to undertake this reform of the 1976 Act. We will refer this document by Mr Duff – whom I thank once again in my capacity as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs – back to committee. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs adopted his text almost unanimously, and we are somewhat reluctant today to see it be referred back to committee. However, precisely because we must not back down in any way, I believe that Parliament should redraft the text so that it is more workable and can receive broader support, but that referral back to committee should not be a way of shelving the reform. The need for a European vision is not due solely to the fact that elections could be held in a transnational college; there is also the question of what the direct election by the people of the Members of the Commission or at least of the Commission President would involve. It is with that question that I shall therefore conclude my speech, extending my thanks once again to the rapporteur, Mr Duff. Carlo Casini  (PPE
).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Prime Minister, I share in the thanks already expressed by others, though I am not going to specify the individual points that justify this gratitude. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO), which I chair, has had the chance to meet you on a number of occasions, including in your own country. We first met you as a delegation and then within the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs; we have witnessed the constant, unambiguous and pro-European commitment of the Hungarian Presidency. The AFCO would like to thank you in particular for your contribution this semester to concluding the report on the citizens’ initiative. Likewise, thank you for the statements that Mrs Győri made here just recently as she took on the commitment, on behalf of the Council, to adhere to the transparency register as soon as possible. The Polish Presidency can hardly fail to follow suit. Hungary chose ‘Stronger Europe’ as its slogan and I sincerely believe that this was well-chosen. You have succeeded in riding out a storm that was made even more intense by the criticisms levelled by Parliament. I must say, as a constitutional scholar – indeed, I have written a book on all the constitutions in Europe – that it is unheard of to try and criticise the constitution of a Member State for reasons of domestic policy. It is also unprecedented to say that a constitution is incompatible with European principles because it refers to human and family values, which are precisely the values of the European tradition and the very building blocks of Europe. I therefore thank you not only for the strong and courageous work of your Presidency, but also for the Constitution of Hungary. Carlo Casini,  
rapporteur

Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will make a single statement covering both matters, which are on the same subject. With this debate and the vote which will follow, we will conclude a task and a period of negotiations in the working group chaired by Mrs Wallis and composed of fellow Members from all political groups, as well as a Commission delegation led by Mr Šefčovič, which has resulted in the drafting of an agreement for the establishment of a common Transparency Register. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) has prepared this report in a few months and has also finalised a report on the amendment of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. Personally, I was very surprised at the amount of public attention that this transparency agreement has garnered. I fear that people think the results will have a greater effect than was actually pursued. Transparency is the defence of right political action, but it is not the right instrument for getting to the heart of corruption. The recent cases of journalists trying to corrupt a few MEPs could also happen outside parliamentary premises. Furthermore, would-be corruptors know how to avoid being identified and the registers are not, therefore, a silver bullet. The right tool for the job is criminal law. Yet if the criminal law of the Member States is not sufficient, we will need to reread Articles 82 to 86 of the Treaty of Lisbon, reflect on whether we can consider the corruption of MEPs to be cross-border crime or an act otherwise detrimental to the Union’s financial interests and determine whether or not to create a European Public Prosecutor, which would, moreover, be a significant step along the path to unity. The Transparency Register has a more modest task. In some countries the term lobbyist has a negative meaning, while in others lobbying is seen as an almost an act of public service because it informs decision-makers on issues they might not otherwise know about. This is especially important for the European Parliament, because often the issues faced by MEPs are very complex and technical and we almost always need to find a balance between businesses and countries with divergent interests. This is where lobbyists become very useful. So we shall no longer call them lobbyists but stakeholders. Of course, interests can be conflicting, and rightly so. I used to be a judge and I can say that cross-examination of opposing sides is considered a condition for uncovering the truth and obtaining justice. So, having lobbyists or stakeholders with conflicting interests is a good thing: what is important is that the judge – and therefore also the MEP – maintains his freedom of thought, independence, and his honest search for the common good. Hence, we have established the Transparency Register, in mutual agreement between Parliament and the Commission with the hope that the Council will soon join the agreement. Those who wish to represent their interests are free to have access to our premises but they must be listed in the Register, where all information needed to identify their legal and financial status will be recorded. The Register is public. There are also organisations that do not pursue selfish interests but try to collaborate in European policies in the name of general values, such as churches, political parties and regions. They do not need to be added to this Register: but, if they have separate offices exclusively tasked with maintaining contact with European institutions, they must be included in their Register, though subject to a different legal regime to stakeholders. As already stated, the new Register also contains an amendment to the Rules of Procedure. There are therefore two reports, but in any case this is just a first step towards more complete transparency. Some hypotheses are already being researched and could be turned into rules after further reflection hence point 9 of the document adopting the agreement indicates the possibility for the reports to carry the details of the stakeholders who met with MEPs during the preparation of the report in question. This broad provision for possible amendments leads me to express a negative opinion on amendments which would put limits on such future deliberations. I hope, however, that Council will join this agreement in short order and that there is also immediate and broad consensus in this House, a strong signal of the duty of transparency and also a call to action. I hope that the vote is nearly unanimous. Carlo Casini,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to clarify a few things. I too would like to strongly emphasise that this agreement was concluded long before the outbreak of the episode with the British journalists. Unfortunately, this is one way in which false information is spread through the media. For example, a major Italian newspaper, the Corriere della Sera
, has today poked fun at Europe by saying that we acted too late and only after these events with journalists. This is not true. It unjustly encourages distrust of Europe. The agreement had been reached long beforehand. If anything, this discussion has arisen with some delay because, once the scandal had exploded, we wondered if we could attempt to further strenthen the agreement. The text has, however, remained the unchanged. That is the first clarification. The second concerns the question of obligation. The register is already mandatory. Those who want to lobby must enrol themselves in the register. I cannot understand what ‘obligatory’ means: it cannot mean that all companies, all enterprises or all citizens must be entered in this register. That is not possible. If anything, it is up to individual MEPs, who, when approached by someone who wants to exert pressure on them, must invite them to register before making contact. The third point refers to possible future amendments. There is a working group for this purpose, which I think needs to have as much room for manoeuvre as possible. I agree that we should identify the lobbyists encountered during the course of the negotiations but I do not know if this task belongs only to the rapporteur or whether it should be extended to the President. We grant the working group the freedom to submit any necessary recommendations. Finally, I too wish to thank both Mr Šefčovič, who has made a huge contribution to the implementation of this agreement, and the representative of the Hungarian Government, for, among other things, the assurance given about the Council joining the agreement in short order, which without doubt has its own uncertainties seeing as the Council certainly represents the second chamber in this case. If the Council is also equipped with the register, this would therefore underline more effectively that the structure of Europe is made up of a government – the Commission – and a legislative body, consisting both of representatives of citizens and of states. Howver, I realise that there are still questions to be answered, since the Council of Ministers represents the states. I am, however, confident that we will come to a positive conclusion.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Giannakou, since she has carried out a great and intelligent piece of work. When we talk about political parties, we must take two problems into consideration. Firstly, parties are not much esteemed in any country. Secondly, when European elections take place, political parties are generally considered to pursue the interests of their national state and not the interests of Europe as a whole. At the level of public opinion, there is therefore a lack of positive esteem either for the parties or for their function in relation to the forging of Europe. We must therefore act urgently. Not only in the Treaty of Lisbon, as has already been noted, but in many constitutions, in almost all European constitutions, the function of the parties is considered to be of national interest, and thus crucial in the creation of democracy and the pursuit of common interests. It is important to stress that I am speaking about constitutions, and not ordinary laws, and that thus I am referring to the fundamental structures of the States and the European Union as a whole. It is thus pressing that we define a statute for parties that are truly European-facing, and not only an algebraic sum of individual national formations that have no permanent European structure on the ground. We need to see parties that think and act in a European context instead. The need I am describing is much more pressing if we really do want to see a uniform European electoral law which, hopefully, could even lead to a single European constituency to sit alongside the national constituencies. This will increase the individual European citizen’s sense of belonging to Europe. I come now to the core of my argument. As has already been emphasised – and I thank the Commissioner in advance – my committee has worked very hard, holding hearings and many meetings, but we need a proposal, an initiative from the European Commission, which brings together European parties within the law of the Union with a new legal form under public law, with a legal personality that is also valid in all Member States and with a uniform structure that allows them to act as representatives of the European public interest. I thank Mrs Giannakou and the Commissioner for their pledges. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everything is uncertain as regards the situation in North Africa. We do not know the immediate outcome of the civil war in Libya, we do not know whether the new political order in the Maghreb countries and Egypt will be conducive to democracy, or whether even worse conditions will arise with regard to democracy and relations with Europe. As for the arrival of an unstoppable stream of fugitives from the shores of Africa onto European shores and those of Lampedusa in particular, it is difficult, even in this case, to distinguish those who are fleeing from violence and fear of death, those who have, for example, escaped from prison, and those who are looking for a future that holds better things than the hunger in their country. We can nevertheless be sure of certain things. Firstly, human dignity must be respected in all human beings. Secondly, the European approach is to offer hospitality to all refugees. Thirdly, the borders of the individual states which form part of the European Union are the borders of Europe. Fourthly, there is a duty of solidarity among all European countries that are part of the Union: this was confirmed, strengthened and made legally binding by the Treaty of Lisbon, which also governs migration policy and the management of migratory flows in an area of freedom, security and justice. Fifthly, the instruments for coping with emergencies such as the current one are already in place, in the form of Directive 2001/55/EC, Frontex and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). The current situation is one of those situations that reveals whether Europe actually is or is not a reality. Commissioner, I greatly enjoyed your speech, but I think we should move from words to deeds. I am well aware of this and I know you will act. We hope that your proposal will be followed up. The important thing is that words are not enough: we need deeds to make Europe a reality. This is an opportunity to build Europe. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the strange thing about the Council’s proposal is that once it has been approved, it will pave the way for the creation of a permanent stability mechanism through an instrument of international law, and hence without a direct link to the institutional structure of the Union. This fact caused great concern in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which I chair, and which has the task of keeping an eye on the coherence of the Union's institutional framework. The simplified revision proposal therefore sparked a lively debate in which arguments based on the solid principles of the process of European integration came up against pragmatism and realpolitik
. In short, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs thinks that in order to deliberate on the proposal to amend the treaty, Parliament must assess the economic governance context under which the proposal falls. We need to know more about how the future mechanism will tie in with existing institutional structures. It would be a mistake to create twin structures which, in the long term, would carry the risk of the Union breaking up. The proposals and suggestions in the report by Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri aim to build suitable bridges between the Union’s institutional structure and the new mechanism. Moreover, I should like to emphasise that the Council must see these issues as fundamental for harmonious cooperation between the European institutions. I therefore strongly urge the European Council to take heed of this requirement and the consideration that it must give us, ahead of our vote on 24 March. As we await a positive sign, I should like to offer my heartfelt thanks for the brilliant work of the rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Hungarian Government has shown great sensitivity towards Europe and towards the principles upon which it is based in this affair. In fact, immediately after the approval of the Hungarian media law, a campaign was waged by the left, which used the phrase ‘gagging law’. In reality, only those who have experienced communism, fascism and Nazism know what a gagging law is, while democratic states know that freedom and pluralism of information are part and parcel of democracy. However, they should be harmonised with all other powers of the rule of law and must not harm, in particular, the foundation of democracy, which is human dignity. For example, Article 21 of the Italian Constitution does in fact guarantee freedom of information, but it also directly prohibits publications that are contrary to public morality. The 1948 law on the freedom of the press in Italy, which no one has ever challenged, lays down an obligation not for authorisation but for registration of any publication, as does the Hungarian law. The reservations that the European Commission itself has rightly expressed do not devalue the stated aim of the Hungarian law, and that aim of ensuring respect for human dignity is demonstrated precisely by the attitude that the Hungarian Government has taken by opening itself up immediately to the acceptance of criticism and taking responsibility for changing the law according to the guidelines provided to it. The statement that the fundamental rights of the European Union will be written into the Hungarian Constitution is also proof of Hungary’s fundamental desire to be part of European culture. In conclusion, I no longer understand the point of this discussion, except to ‘blame’ Hungary for having supported its government and parliament democratically by a two-thirds majority. Yet this gives Europe reason for hope, not reason for criticism. I am therefore grateful to the Commission and to the Hungarian Government. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Members who have already spoken have said practically everything. They have recalled the facts, assessed them and made specific requests. Therefore, as this is the last speech scheduled, I should like to add something that has not yet been said, and what comes to mind are the thoughts of a very great European, John Paul II, a man who very effectively helped to bring down the Berlin Wall. In his spiritual testament, he mentions the four values that underpin our future civilisation, that is to say, the civilisation of love: they are life, peace, bread and religious freedom. Then I think of everything that has been written by Giorgio La Pira, the former Mayor of Florence, who promoted large conferences on Christian civilisation at the height of the cold war. In his book Premesse della politica
 (‘Premises of politics’), he wrote that every political idea has a particular concept of man underlying it. For Christian Europe, he writes, man is essentially a praying being, that is to say, a being able to enter a dialogue, to conceive of the infinite and to talk to God. Taking away a man’s ability to take part in private and public dialogue is not only a negation of religion, but also a negation of man himself. I leave these thoughts with the House and with you, High Representative, as a contribution towards a concrete and effective commitment by our European Union, which is rooted in its Christian identity and never fails to proclaim its purpose of defending and promoting human dignity and human rights. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment aims to make our judgment on Egypt’s actions more incisive. It is not only a matter of acknowledging that Egypt has at least done something, but asking it to intervene quickly and immediately to free these hostages, urging the country never to use lethal force to repel people crossing the Sinai. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is also called upon to make immediate contact with the people currently being held hostage. ‘urges the Egyptian authorities to take all necessary measures to secure the release of Eritreans held hostage, to avoid the use of lethal force against illegal immigrants crossing the borders of the country, to protect their dignity and their physical and psychological integrity and to guarantee that detained migrants have the opportunity to contact the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and that the High Commissioner has access to all asylum seekers and refugees in custody’. Carlo Casini  (PPE
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, I should like to ask the proposer of the amendment to clarify an issue. According to the text read out, the requested intervention concerns all those who request the right of asylum. I should rather say ‘those who have the right of asylum’, because ‘who request’ is too dangerous, as there is the risk that anyone can request the right of asylum. Vice-versa, by coordinating this amendment with the intervention of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, it will be the latter that will assess this. In any case, I should ask the proposer to modify the amendment with the words ‘those who have the right of asylum’. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I am speaking above all to thank all the members of my committee for their good work, particularly Mr Lamassoure and Mrs Gurmai, who did a great job in achieving the aim of implementing one of the most important changes in the Treaty of Lisbon. The committee also listened to the opinion of all national parliaments and experts, working in close contact with the Commission – for which I offer my heartfelt thanks to Commissioner Šefčovič – and with the Council’s willingness to engage in dialogue, for which I should like to thank Mr Chastel. Applying Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure also worked very well, allowing us to work effectively with the Committee on Petitions. I personally supported the need for an annual deadline for the entry into force of the regulation and this was certainly not to delay its application but, quite the contrary, to ensure that its initial implementation will be carried out comprehensively and conscientiously so that all Member States, without exception, are able to fulfil the requirement to prepare participation and checking instruments. I believe that the greatest positive effect of the new scheme is to increase the awareness of EU citizenship, which has now been enriched by the power of participation in the legislative process, including providing the stimulus. I am also certain that the mechanisms provided will guarantee easy participation for citizens, while also preventing abuse. Ultimately, I believe that, with the Christmas festivities only a few days away, the adoption of this regulation represents a nice gift for European citizens and Europe itself. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 I abstained from the final vote on the Berlinguer resolution because Amendment 2 was thrown out. This was extremely important for ruling out possible erroneous interpretations of item 40, which states that Parliament ‘strongly supports plans to enable the mutual recognition of the effects of civil status documents’. The expression could suggest, for example, a European Union-wide obligation to recognise a union between people of the same sex registered in a Member State where such a union is permitted. In actual fact, we must distinguish between the effects of a completed legal action (in the case of marriage) and the effects of an official registration document. The latter bears full witness to what is documented (for example, that a homosexual marriage has been entered into in Holland) and this public witness is the effect of the official marital status document. However, the effects of the official registration document are something different and their recognition (for example, a survivor’s pension) is not permitted in a State that does not recognise them. Matters of family law are, in any case, part of the identity of individual states and cannot be touched by EU law. The possibility of a different interpretation led me to choose to abstain.

 I voted for Mrs Weber’s motion for a resolution on the Roma in Europe because of its balanced, constructive content. It is not enough to shout against discrimination, perhaps exploiting real and extremely serious problems for the purposes of party-political wrangling. Naturally, we need to firmly reassert the principles of non-discrimination, of free movement and the resulting rights and obligations – as does the resolution by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – but more important still is to undertake practical reforms to solve the problems, in order to implement fundamental human rights. Immigration is a European issue and the time has come, as called for by Mrs Weber’s resolution, to tackle it at European level. The Roma issue only partly overlaps with the issue of integration, and in any case it has specific features which must also be addressed at European level. The structure of the EU was designed on the premise of the territorial stability of the member peoples. A nomadic lifestyle may be a characteristic of a people, which must also be respected, but inclusion must come about in a spirit of solidarity, in accordance with European rules, without the individual Member States playing it by ear. This is the resolution’s proposal which won our support. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Freedom of the media is beyond discussion, and no one in any democratic system can dispute the need for the media to be independent and pluralistic. In an information society such as ours, however, it is becoming increasingly evident that independence does not mean the absence of any rules and that pluralism is not a sufficient value. The power of the media in an information society is really a public power which Montesquieu, were he alive today, would have tried to balance against the other powers: legislative, executive and judicial. These three traditional powers must also be independent, but a reciprocal limit is established between them. As far as I can see, this problem has not been examined in depth. I will restrict myself to making two remarks. Journalists’ right to freedom is a human right that is at least equal to the right to dignity and privacy of every citizen. A duty of checks and balances therefore also exists. Judicial power must be transparent, but certain investigations must be absolutely secret during the initial stages if the truth is to be uncovered in the interests of justice and, therefore, ultimately of the public. I believe that these two aspects are always neglected in our debates. By making this speech, I have attempted to leave some record of them. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Once again we have the regrettable situation in which arguments proposing unjust solutions to the issue of the right to life are being applied to the discussion of a real and serious problem (in this case the fight against HIV), thus making it impossible to vote in favour. The use of the words ‘sexual and reproductive health’ has now become the means by which to convince parliaments to promote abortion. We must not let ourselves be deceived. Everyone, including myself, for a start, must promote sexual and reproductive health, but when the words indicate a different and, in fact, opposite state of affairs (whereby killing a human being is understood as a woman’s right to freedom), it then becomes necessary to expose the deceit. Abortion in the world is a real tragedy, but it is a real tragedy in our Europe too! My intention in voting against the resolution is not to hinder the wide-ranging efforts to combat AIDS, but to oppose the method and the content that I mentioned. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their continued, determined and intelligent work. The committee which I chair, given the evident and sensitive institutional implications resulting from the creation of the new Service, has followed the preparation of the text of the agreement extremely closely since the very beginning. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs not only participated in the work of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, under the very strict definition of cooperation laid down in Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure, but it also selected both of the rapporteurs. I am certain that Parliament will approve the document by a large majority. There will be work to do in order to make the European External Action Service (EEAS) able to actually perform the role it has been given by the new treaty and by the enthusiasm of the rapporteurs. The Service is not only a way to increase the European Union’s presence in various nations throughout the world; it also has a very important symbolic value, which is to express the unity of the 27 Member States. It is a natural consequence of the recognition of the EU’s legal personality. It is an incredibly important step towards the goal to be reached. The more votes cast in its favour, the further that step will carry us. I hope it will be reinforced even further by the establishment of a European Diplomatic Academy, and I would like to nominate the prestigious European University Institute in Florence to develop it.

It is very sad that for years now, the European Parliament has been unable to resolve a tragic contradiction. In every document in which measures to combat poverty, hunger and violence in the world are admirably proposed, some manage to include the declaration, whether direct or indirect, of the so-called right to abortion as a vehicle for the health and development of populations. The initiative of some is met, on the one hand, with the virtual indifference of the majority and, on the other, with a certain diffidence of the minority. Yet the contradiction and the tragedy are obvious. The principle of equal dignity for all human beings and that of special, rightful solidarity towards the youngest members of society are being abandoned at the very time when we are supposed to be pursuing the objective of combating discrimination and protecting health. This has also happened today in the case of the Cashman report, paragraph 42 of which, in contradicting the entire document, has forced myself and a number of MEPs to ultimately reject the report as a whole. When balanced against one another, in fact, the bad points that are being promoted unfortunately outweigh the good points present in other parts of the text. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Madam President, Mr López Garrido, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this membership is surely a sign of one of the European Union’s missions: the mission to defend and promote human rights. A mission that is already fully formulated and borne out by history, by the fact that individual Member States already belong to the European Council convention, by the reiteration that the general principles of the convention and Member States’ constitutions are now part of European law. So this symbolic gesture is extremely important. However, translating this ideal concept into substantive legal rules is not so simple: this report refers chiefly and ultimately only to institutional questions, and is completely acceptable. I must say that I also thank Mr Atondo, and am bound to report that the AFCO Committee on Constitutional Affairs – which I chair - has approved this document almost unanimously. We are therefore satisfied with this document, and I will not dwell on individual elements of it, because we fully support everything that the President of the Council and the Commissioner have said. I would like to make just one suggestion, since the statement about the institutional presence of European Members of Parliament within the European Council Parliamentary Assembly when meeting to appoint the judge and the judges is somewhat vague: I would say that there is a small problem with the relationship between the population of Europe, of the European Union, and the populations of other countries. Luckily, the regulation governing membership and representation in the European Council Parliamentary Assembly already states that there can be no fewer than two per State, and no more than 18 altogether. Given the importance of the European Union, I suggest that we should draw the line at 18. I must conclude, however, and so I will finish by saying that this resolution exposes a problem that it is worth examining in more depth, in other words, the problem that we have already highlighted many times of the relationship between the Courts. I believe we must reflect a little more upon this problem but, above all, on the problem of the European spirit: we are the European Union and, as stated in Article 2 of the Treaty of Lisbon, we are founded on human dignity and human rights – and equality is founded on human dignity. In Europe, we are not united on this point, and so we must reflect carefully on this concept of human dignity, its limits and what it covers. That is not the subject of this decision and this very welcome report, however. I thank the rapporteur. Carlo Casini  (PPE

I have cast my vote, which is categorically in favour of the two reports drafted by Mr Méndez de Vigo. I am satisfied for two reasons: the committee that I chair acted promptly, reaching a provisional agreement, and that agreement paved the way for the one reached today in plenary by a very large majority. From this perspective, I have endorsed the idea of voting against paragraph 5, introduced by an amendment of mine tabled in committee, to emphasise that the appointment of the 18 new Members will have to comply as far as possible with the provisions of the 1976 Electoral Act, which requires that Members be elected directly by the European citizens. Therefore, the preference will have to be for an automatic method that allows the candidates who received the most votes of those who were not elected during the last European elections to join Parliament. If, however, the national electoral system does not allow for such a calculation, we can resort to appointment by the national parliaments. Carlo Casini,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be very brief since the committee I chair reached a very comprehensive agreement, in line with what has already been said, and so there is no need to make the debate too long-winded. The problem which arose and was discussed in committee mainly concerned the following: both the Electoral Act of 1976 and the Treaty of Lisbon require Members of this Parliament to be directly elected by the peoples of the various nations. This is a problem for cases in which the electoral system used to elect MEPs for this parliamentary term does not allow entry into Parliament of candidates who did not obtain enough votes to secure a seat, but did obtain enough votes to allow their entry at a later date. Some electoral systems do allow this, but it appears that others do not. Therefore, if we do not wish to considerably delay the integration of the Members into Parliament, we should have recourse to exceptional, transitional appointment systems, as envisaged by the Council. Following lengthy discussions, my committee concluded that this is a fair position. We therefore support what has already been said. Indeed, I must say that I personally tabled an amendment proposing the appointment of observers for an interim period prior to the election of the new Members to this Parliament. Although this amendment is still under discussion, we shall have to vote against it – even if it is my amendment – since the compromise amendment provides for the swift, immediate integration of the MEPs into Parliament.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcomed the statements by Mr López Garrido and Mr Šefčovič. The new Treaty of Lisbon urges us to swiftly adopt a systematic course of action to promote the citizens’ initiative, which is testament to the existence of a European people. Indeed, it is a well-known fact that one of the harshest criticisms of the Union is that it is not a fully democratic structure. The Treaty of Lisbon has sought to reduce the democratic deficit in several ways, including by making provision for at least one million European citizens to submit a proposal for a legislative initiative. This new instrument, in order to be a serious tool, will have to produce legal effects of a certain importance. It certainly cannot have equivalent value to the pre-existing petitions which are signed by a wide range of individuals – a clear distinction must be made – and it must therefore be regulated in such a way as to prevent its abuse and still allow broad discussion, as the expression of informed and verifiable popular consensus. However, the most important aspect of the initiative laid down in Article 11 of the Treaty of Lisbon is its symbolic significance: the democratic deficit is being tackled not only by the decision-making power of the people’s representatives, but even more so by the very existence of a European people which is not just the mathematical sum of the citizens of the individual nations. Therefore, with regard to the rules we are considering, there are two aspects that I consider to be particularly important: the first concerns the subject matter, which must be – as someone already said – a European issue; the second is the distribution of the minimum number of signatories across a significant number of Member States, representing an appropriate percentage with respect to the electoral weight of each country. I hope that the new rules will help citizens of France, Italy, Germany, Spain and so on feel that they are, first and foremost, citizens of Europe. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 I voted against the resolution on equality between women and men in the European Union (2009), even though I agree with a great deal of its content, because we cannot call for equality for a certain category of people without denying it to another category of human beings. I refer to paragraph 38, which claims to guarantee women’s rights by ensuring them easy access to abortion. The destruction of the smallest and most defenceless individuals in the shape of unborn children cannot be considered a way of confirming women’s dignity and freedom. An anti-life conspiracy is at work, which uses tried and tested ways of deceiving us. We must reveal it for what it is. Putting together extremely fair requests with extremely unfair claims and twisting the meanings of words are stratagems that have proved effective during European Parliament votes, but I will have nothing to do with it. We cannot talk about the drama of abortion, which deserves the attention of politicians as well as moralists, without also recognising the rights of newborns or at least calling for proper education as far as respect for life is concerned and organising forms of support for difficult or unwanted pregnancies so that they can be allowed to reach their natural conclusions.

I should like to say how pleased I am, as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, about the agreement that has been reached on the principal lines of a new Framework Agreement between the Commission and Parliament. I must, however, make it clear that we need to think more deeply about the nature of the relationship between these two institutions. The outlook for democratic growth in the Union continues to be one in which Parliament is seen as representing the people and the Council as a sort of second chamber, representing the States. In such a context, the Commission should be considered as a government, and it is clear that this configuration would require rules that are considerably more detailed than the adjustments deservedly outlined today. I should like to add a thought on the citizens’ right of initiative. The relevant rules will have to be tailored to the effects that we consider must follow as a result. These effects must be considered in comparison with those stemming from the existing right of every citizen to submit a petition to the European Parliament and those connected to the limited powers of Parliament. Parliament has no power of initiative but it does have the power to request that the Commission initiate legislation. Carlo Casini  (PPE

With my emphatic vote in favour, I want to add greater force to the words spoken by President Barroso; words that gave notice of the construction over the next five years of a more united and stronger Europe. He began his speech by recalling the fundamental values of European unity, the most important of which is human dignity. I agree wholeheartedly, but the problem is that the word ‘dignity’ has become ambiguous, because it is used not only to guarantee life and human equality, but also to discriminate against and do harm to the most vulnerable members of society and even to justify death. I hope, therefore, that in the next five years, the Commission will work in such a way that the word ‘dignity’ will be restored to its unambiguous and true meaning. It is of symbolic importance that on 15 December last year, during the height of efforts to form the new Commission, 500 000 European citizens from 17 countries requested, in a collective petition, that our institutions interpret and implement the Charter of Fundamental Rights in every decision, on the basis of the equal dignity of every human being. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the principle of equality between women and men is part of the central current of the great river that has already freed foreigners, slaves, black people, and that is the principle of human dignity, the same for everyone. The Tarabella report and that of the Commission are therefore both commendable, because it is right to always insist thoroughly on this principle. There are, however, two critical remarks that I feel I should make. The flow of human dignity and equality should concern everyone, absolutely everyone, including those who are waiting to enter the world, unborn children. It is therefore unacceptable to do as point 38 of this report does, that is, to speak of abortion as an aspect of sexual reproductive rights, or women’s rights. No one is denying the complexity of problems where difficult and unwanted pregnancies are concerned – there are serious problems – but, in any case, these things should not be spoken about except in relation to the need to nurture respect for life and to offer mothers all kinds of help so that they can freely choose to continue with their pregnancy. My second criticism concerns the extension of the concept of sexual and reproductive health, as is done in recital X, beyond physical and mental aspects, to include social aspects as well. I wonder what it means that all sexual behaviour, whatever it may be, must receive from others justifications of wellbeing, and therefore recognition and praise. Does this not mean that we end up violating not only freedom of conscience, but also freedom of opinion? I will merely ask this question because I do not think it is a banal one. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in voting in favour of the joint resolution, I am highlighting the particular seriousness of the violence carried out in Malaysia in response to an exclusively nominalistic issue. Indeed, it is certain that both Christians and Muslims believe in only one God, who is the God of all men, believers and non-believers alike. The fact that He is referred to by different names is absolutely secondary. To claim that the Muslim God is only Muslim and can therefore be invoked only by Muslims, using a traditionally Muslim name, means returning to the ancestral and tribal view that there is a God for each group of human beings. In other words, it means contradicting the monotheistic idea that makes universal religions which, like Christianity and Islam, oppose idolatry and polytheism, great religions that are close to people. No less serious is the persecution of the Copts in Egypt. It was on the shores of the Mediterranean that monotheistic religions, which claim to be, and are, forces for promoting brotherhood and peace, were born. However, it is remarkable that it should be precisely on the shores of the Mediterranean, in Jerusalem – a holy city for those who believe in God, Allah and Jehovah – that the main breeding ground for conflict is found. It is precisely Egypt that is the most powerful country in the area, where Christians and Muslims must coexist peacefully in order to play a peacemaking role throughout the southern Mediterranean area.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for this Parliament, I am pleased that the Spanish Presidency attaches importance to the fulfilment of the structural reforms provided for by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in particular, with regard to the European External Action Service, to the Citizens’ Initiative, and to the European Union’s adherence to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, for which my committee has already appointed a rapporteur, the Spaniard, Mr Jáuregui Atondo, whom you already know. However, in an interview published in the Spanish newspaper, El País
, last Sunday, you expressed the wish, Mr Zapatero, that the law on religious freedom might result in Spain taking steps towards normalisation within all its public institutions. Thus, I would like, in this respect, to suggest that we reflect very briefly on the fact that Europe’s structures are a means of achieving an objective, and the European Union’s objective is confirmed in Article 2 of the Treaty of Lisbon: the promotion of dignity, equality, freedom and solidarity. I must therefore voice some concern about the direction in which this debate on values is heading. Cultural unity comes before economic unity. Europe’s spirit is stronger than the public – excuse me, judicial – structure. Europe’s spirit is rooted in the instinct for truth and beauty belonging to ancient Greece, in the cult of justice belonging to Rome, and on the basis of this extraordinarily great heritage it is Christianity that has added the value of human beings, always as equals from conception to natural death. Today, it is in the name of the Cross of Christ that we ask to go to Haiti, to be present in Haiti, because all human beings, and the poorest in particular, are at the heart of this. And so I ask you: what does ‘normalisation’ mean with regard to religious freedom? Does it mean perhaps preventing all citizens from publicly expressing their religion? Does it mean forgetting the roots, including the Christian roots, of our countries? Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the decision of the European Court of Human Rights has upset not only worshippers but also everyone who, for centuries, has viewed the crucifix as a sign of hope and solidarity, something providing solace and freedom from fear and pain. We hope that that decision will be modified by the Grand Chamber since it is clearly irrational. Should we do away with the very name of the Red Cross? Should we remove the huge crucifixes on mountain tops which tower over cities and valleys? Will it be prohibited for the Queen of England, as has already been mentioned, to be the head of the Anglican Church? Nevertheless, the case invites a very important reflection from a civil and political point of view: are human rights merely the rights of individuals, as parties isolated from a social environment, or is the right to express a specific form of piety also a right of the peoples? Do tradition, history, intelligence and art count for nothing when, for millennia, they have characterised a people’s identity? Furthermore, the question also rightly concerns the relationship between subsidiarity and human rights, and I note that the latter, aside from certain fundamental principles which must be considered universal and irrefutable, may be interpreted in different ways, and human rights may even conflict with each other. Why should a state be denied the chance, through its laws, to resolve these conflicts and to interpret and implement human rights according to the ethical views of its people? The issue therefore goes beyond the question of crucifixes. On other occasions, the European Court has recognised, with regard to the right to life, the exclusive power of the States to decide on the most controversial matters, such as the regulation of abortion and euthanasia. Now, the Treaty of Lisbon requires us to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights and consequently, as the European Union, also to respect the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights. Therefore, we ought to think about the new and different direction currently being taken by the Court. It would be a serious matter if a supranational power, especially if exercised by a limited number of people and not as the democratic expression of popular will, were to become repressive and demeaning, insensitive to people’s feelings and hearts and therefore ultimately opposed to freedom. This is why I hope that the resolution tabled by the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will be adopted with the votes of a large number of Members. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, the subject is an oral amendment to paragraph 131, on which I am in agreement with the other two rapporteurs, Mr López Aguilar and Mr Berlinguer. The current text states: ‘calls on the Council, the Commission and Member States to evaluate and review current international, European and national laws and policies on drugs and to promote harm reduction policies, notably with a view to the conferences on those issues held at UN level’. The oral amendment proposes inserting the words ‘prevention’ and ‘recovery’, meaning that the call to evaluate and review laws would concern ‘harm reduction, prevention and recovery policies’.

 Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution because it indicates the right way to strengthen European unity around the fundamental values that constitute its very identity. We cannot fool ourselves that it will be possible to achieve agreement on so-called common values. We may nevertheless hope that the application of reason can help the various political components to look more closely at what is right and fair where progressing along the road to European unity is concerned. The clear distinction between the right to free movement and the principle of non-discrimination, on the one hand, and the value of the family as a natural society founded on marriage, on the other, has led to the formulation of the paragraph that upholds the independence of individual States in family law and the ban on discrimination against any human being. Those who, like me, fully promote the principle of equality, affirming equality between children who are born and those who are not yet born, can only support the principle of non-discrimination against people with different sexual tendencies, but cannot accept the destruction of the concept of marriage or of the family. The significance of this concept, as recognised by Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is fundamental to the succession of generations and the educational capacities of heterosexual couples.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which I have the honour of chairing, gave me the task of acting as rapporteur on this document, together with the rapporteurs from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs, sitting jointly. This is the first time that Rule 51 of the Rules of Procedure has been applied and I must say that, in my view, the result has been very satisfactory with regard to the cooperation between the three rapporteurs in carrying out their work. There have, in fact, been problems, some of them serious, with regard to the timeframe and, above all, the involvement of the shadow rapporteurs and the timely translation of the amendments, of which there were nearly 500. However, all that is due not to Rule 51 itself, but rather to the very short deadlines that we gave ourselves in order to have a document that we could submit to the Council summit taking place on 10 December. It was thus inevitable that there would be these problems linked to the pace of work. For the rest, I believe that we should acknowledge that Rule 51, which has been used for the first time, is useful. The document under consideration by this Parliament cannot be explained in the few seconds that remain to me. However, I must express my satisfaction that the codecision system has been extended to become the normal system of legislation, that immigration is now understood to be a European issue – and I hope that this is how the Commission and the Council interpret it – and not a problem for individual Member States acting in solidarity with each other, that the view taken of cooperation with the national parliaments is not that they are guardians laying down limits, but rather positive collaborators in the legislative process, and finally, that there is that reference to human rights which is extremely important, and which is the spirit of the European Union. I therefore believe that, in view of the fact that it was not supposed to detail down to the finest particulars the implementation of the Stockholm Programme, but only to formulate general outlines, this document is certainly a positive step. There will be time and a way in which to make it more comprehensive, and to include more details. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we shall of course respect your decisions, but it is my understanding that there are some reservations about certain amendments, namely that they do not directly relate to the Treaty of Lisbon. I may be mistaken, but it seems to me that, until now, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has had general powers to make proposals concerning regulatory amendments. It can do this if the amendments are suggested by a group of Members, or by individual Members, and also on its own initiative. Therefore, the fact that the opportunity has been taken to make a few corrections, also with reference to other aspects, within the ambit of a wider reform of the Rules of Procedure under the Treaty of Lisbon cannot, in my view, be seen as unacceptable – all the more so since quite a few amendments would serve to reflect the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon in the Rules of Procedure, sometimes through rules that are reproduced technically and materially in them, but much more often through reference to the spirit of the treaty. One need only think of the role of Parliament, which has been strengthened in relation to the Council, but which is also being strengthened by the Rules of Procedure where the internal relationships with institutions within Parliament itself are concerned. We shall, of course, respect your decisions, Mr President, but I felt it was necessary to make these observations. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Mr President, first of all I wish to correct my first and second votes – I meant to abstain, but I made a mistake because I acted in haste and pressed the wrong button. My first two votes are abstentions from the whole day’s votes. The statement I am making is this: there is a grave original sin in the proposal that has led to today’s debate and it is a sin that has already been pointed out by the President of the Italian Republic. Added to this sin is the opportunism of choosing the Italian Prime Minister’s legal action against certain newspapers – a process that is clearly in full compliance with the rule of law – as a means by which to attack him. Therefore, we have not voted for the proposal by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, and so on, but nor have we voted for the motion by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) because, although it deserves recognition insofar as it safeguards Italy’s dignity, it totally overlooks the problem of the balance between the media and the other state powers, which exists in Europe and which is a serious problem in Italy too. This does not just concern the Italian Prime Minister’s conflict of interests in this area; it concerns other problems too. At national level, on the other hand, my party, the UDC, is continually challenging the majority on this. I believe that we, too, must send out a message of support by abstaining. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I all I feel it is my duty to thank the rapporteur, who has done a marvellous job, and, as chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I must also thank all of the members of the committee and of both committees – the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development – who delivered the opinion, for their very swift work. We have, in fact, tried to prepare a document – which I hope will be approved – that can be presented to the Council of 29 and 30 October. We are well aware that this report is not a definitive report. It is intended merely to point out a few courses of action, a path of some kind to follow, to the Council and thus to the High Representative who will be appointed. It will be the High Representative’s job to devise his own organisational plan which, in turn, will have to be examined by us. Therefore, it is only guidelines that are being submitted to our Parliament. We also know that the success of this operation regarding the External Action Service is linked to the role of the High Representative, who will have to be able to organise and manage everyone. Through him, we want a consistent and uniform foreign policy. We are well aware that there are problems, that much has already been said, but problems are there to be solved. The important thing is that the compass, the information, the scope is clear. The Brok report provides some interesting proposals in this regard – I have to be brief because my speaking time is up – but, in any case, they include the integration of the Service into the administrative structure of the Commission, the decision to further develop the Community model and the proposal, which is, moreover, laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, that the staff must be taken from the secretariats of the Commission and the Council and from the delegations of the Commission itself. There are two innovations that I believe are worth mentioning: Union embassies, headed by officials from the European External Action Service, which would also include the Commission delegations present in third countries and the Council liaison offices, with the possible secondment of experts from the Directorates-General; and the foundations that have been laid for the establishment of a European diplomatic college, which is an interesting idea. My speaking time has run out. I only hope that this report really is adopted, and adopted by a large majority. Carlo Casini  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to rationalise an apparently ambiguous feeling that I have after this first stage of the debate, because I fully subscribe to the strong words spoken by my chairman, Mr Daul, but I also subscribe to the words of Mr Sassoli who should, by all rights, be a political opponent of mine. Let me explain myself better: am I schizophrenic for having such ambivalent feelings, or am I trying unnecessarily to reconcile the fact that, in Italy, I sit on the opposition benches while, here, I find myself next to the People of Freedom party, in the People’s Party? I feel I can answer that by highlighting an obvious contrast between the scope and the importance of the subject of freedom of information, which is a very important subject… Were Montesquieu alive today, he would have spoken not only of legislative, executive and judicial powers, but of other powers too, and he would have put the fourth power, the press, in first place, as it represents a problem of freedom, of the fight against mental slavery, and a problem of democracy. On the other hand, the straw that broke the camel’s back after months and months of barbarisation of the entire Italian press – let it be said – of the right and of the left; the quality of the Italian press has been poor for months now because politics really has reached a low point – was Mr Berlusconi’s legal action. Please indulge me: I was a criminal judge for four years in the Fifth criminal division of the Court of Cassation, where we judged the crime of libel. This is how I know Mr Mauro is right: I saw many of these actions for libel, and no one protested. Citizens have the right to defend themselves in these situations too. I therefore hope that, by making a genuine attempt to reconcile seemingly opposing points, we will actually come up with a new and better way of tackling the problem for the whole of Europe and not just in regard to Italy.

I think that it is now time to put into effect, to implement the Treaty of Lisbon as soon as the ratifications take place, something which we hope will happen imminently. The committee which I chair has been doing everything in its power for some time now but, above all, it is important for Parliament to be aware of its new responsibilities: it must not allow the de facto 
loss of any aspect of its wider legislative functions. I would, however, like to highlight one issue which I do not think has been raised so far: there were many reasons why the Irish people previously rejected the Treaty, but one was the fear, among some voters, that the European legal system could violate, in Ireland. certain fundamental values concerning the right to life and the notion of family. These fears were allayed through declarations adopted by the European Councils of December 2008 and June 2009. I think this is important not just for Ireland, but for the whole of Europe. It was clarified, in fact, that the acquis communautaire
 does not concern the area relating to the right to life and the family. This clarification does not apply solely to Ireland, but to all the Member States. In reality, there was no need to clarify this because in various judgments involving France, the United Kingdom and Poland, the European Court of Human Rights had already ruled that in the areas of life, the value of life, respect for life and the family, it must be left up to the Member States to decide according to their history, tradition and culture. However, Ireland’s attention to detail had the merit of formally clarifying this point which, as I was saying, now applies to the entire European Union. I believe that this is a good thing, which makes holding the double referendum worthwhile. Naturally, we know full well that European culture consists of the sum of the cultures of all of the countries that make it up, and we all want Europe to be not just an economic area but also, and above all, a community of values. I therefore think it proper that we show Ireland both our satisfaction and our gratitude for everything that it offers Europe in terms of its history and its ideals. Europe needed Ireland, not only for technical reasons relating to its mechanisms and organisational structure, but also for Ireland’s contribution to what we are all seeking: the essence of Europe.

My judgment on the motion for a resolution on the protection of minors in Lithuania is intended to demonstrate a very serious institutional concern. Often, individual MEPs or political groups claim to address issues that relate to the domestic policy of individual States: that does not seem right. In the case in point, the plan is seemingly to make the European Parliament express an essentially negative opinion on a Lithuanian law – the full content of which is unknown – with the laudable aim of protecting minors, while surreptitiously imposing a position that the individual Member States have been left to establish at their own discretion. This, I might add, is something which the European Court of Human Rights has stipulated on many occasions. The principle of equality is beyond doubt, and no one is trying to call into question the dignity of persons with particular sexual orientations. My reservation is of an institutional nature because it concerns the relations between the European Union and individual Member States. Carlo Casini  (PPE

 While, in non-EU countries caught up in the current crisis, the fight for growth and jobs is being met with economic and financial leverage – whether legal or monetary – under the control of a single political and administrative body, in Europe, we continue to endure political delays from an EU that still cannot overcome the issue of unitary governance. This situation is aggravated by the fact that, despite the major ongoing effort to strengthen coordination between Member States on their own budgets, conclusive action to coordinate tax systems is still excluded from political debate, especially in respect of the direct taxation system. This delay produces tax competition that could also be construed as dumping, which has a negative impact, especially on the stability of businesses, including geographically, and risks, above all, affecting areas that are already weak and corporate social responsibility. This is why I regret the failure to adopt the part of the amendment that highlighted the risks of tax competition, to the detriment of consolidating national budgets, and, to this end, suggested the introduction of a minimum rate of corporate taxes. I hope that we can make up for this delay in the near future. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 The ongoing global crisis has made clear the lack of political involvement in supra-national economic governance, especially in the European Union. When, way back in 1988-1989, European leaders took the brave decision to begin convergence of the Member State economies with a view to the single currency, both by completing the internal market and by coordinating the Member States’ economies, it was made very clear, from a pro-EU point of view, that this objective could only be fully achieved by twinning the pillar of monetary governance, under an autonomous European Central Bank, with the pillar of economic governance exercised by Commission, Council and Parliament. Only the two pillars together could underpin the future of the European Union. However, this sharing of responsibilities has to be combined with the sharing of opportunities and economic results. Just as, at the national level, varying rates of regional economic growth are balanced out by single-state governance, including by joint participation in the public debt, the same should happen at European level in relations between Member States, which should evolve, making shared, cooperative and reciprocal destinies a reality. I think that this report and the amendments that have been adopted are in line with this view. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 A local authority has the utmost political autonomy when it achieves total control on tax matters, and therefore has total economic and financial control over deciding its budget. Unfortunately, the serious delay in achieving this level of autonomy is particularly clear with regard to the agreement on the multiannual financial framework. During this very process, European and pro-European ambitions and responsibilities clash with the selfishness of the Member States, resulting in increased national and nationalist sentiment. It is regrettable that the political mentality that always made the common European interest a priority has been lost, replaced by an accountant’s mentality where what is given to the European budget and what is received nationally under ‘community’ policies are continually set off against one another. The EU will only reach its full political potential by boosting its powers on budgets and taxing genuine own resources, including through eurobonds and a financial transaction tax, and boosting its resources, so that they are suited to meet the challenges and political objectives that it aims to pursue and achieve. It seems to me that this joint resolution is heading in that direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

The global financial crisis, which began to show itself in 2008, is, unfortunately, far from over. Instead, in some ways, with productive sectors now weakened by the period we have gone through, it seems even more serious and now might become structural within economic systems. On the other hand, even the repeated and numerous recurrences of the original causes of the crisis demonstrate that the ‘market’ is not an abstract entity that can regulate itself efficiently, as experts in the new welfare economy would still have us believe, but that it is, instead, a system managed by a few individuals worldwide who, often unscrupulously, attack financial markets, productive systems and institutions with the hope of profiting from their weakening or even from their failure. The actions taken by each individual country are not enough to address this global crisis. What we need are decisions made at an equal level. The financial transaction tax would be useful in mitigating the devastating effects of raider activity, especially if it were adopted globally and if it did not impact on national bonds or pension funds. Meanwhile, and in the hope that this might happen, it is important that it should start, at least, with the European dimension. This report and the amendments adopted are in line with this outlook.

The globalisation of the economy has led to the need to step up economic cooperation between the EU and other areas of the world. This aim needs to be pursued not only through various fundamental principles that make trade balances sustainable, although these are, of course important, but, above all, through support for the EU’s production systems, to make them more competitive on the world stage. It is therefore necessary for both the principle of legal and economic/financial reciprocity and the anti-dumping principle to always be an integral part of economic agreements, with particular reference to the fiscal and social security dimensions, so that a correct approach may be taken based on the comparative and competitive advantages of enterprises and production systems. In addition, it is necessary for the principle of reciprocity to permeate access to Chinese public procurement. Finally, the EU ought to take a more farsighted and attentive approach to investments in developing countries, made also by competing countries, such as China, in order to better evaluate the impact of these interventions in political, economic, social and environmental terms. I believe that the report we have adopted seeks to achieve these objectives. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 The social dimension of our communities – particularly small and medium-sized ones – is more significant than their economic weight. In this vein, I would like to underline that some essential services, such as those relating to people’s health, the environment (including the water and waste cycles) and local public transport, should be thought of as directly connected to fundamental human rights. This is because they can be defined, in political terms, as public goods and services, even if they are managed by private entities. Making them more efficient, effective and economical, while pursuing increased and higher quality standards is another thing. Moreover, denying access to many sections of the population, especially the most vulnerable and neediest, whenever we apply the rules of the market plain and simple to these sectors is something else entirely. That is why, given their special status and social relevance, in the next reform being drawn up, we must retain a precise distinction between the rules that regulate State aid for services of general economic interest and the rules that govern other forms of State aid. The adopted report partly upholds this view. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 Different rates of development and the changes in the ways of life that exist in our societies have led to profound variations in the demographic pyramid. If higher life expectancy is a positive aspect of these changes, the same could not be said for others, in particular, for those that concern young people and women. With regard to these categories of the population, elements that have been shown to be inadequate include work policies that have put a strain both on training (including at university and post university), in favour of a more pronounced trend towards entering the world of work, and on accompanying policies concerning remaining in work, with a view to greater fulfilment of family needs. To this end, among the initiatives to be reinforced by more profitable use of Structural Funds, one could, on the one hand, include the provision of services in support of guidance and of satisfying the demand for work with job offers, whereby these services are adequate, operational and easily accessible to those who require them. On the other hand, one could intervene by strengthening policies in support of the family (including greater diffusion of public or private nurseries and organisation of flexible work). I believe that the approved report leads in this direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 Economic, social and territorial cohesion policy is one of the fundamental pillars on which our coexistence within the EU is based, as it promotes growth in areas struggling to develop in order to enable them to converge and compete fairly against more developed areas. The experience acquired also during the current programming period shows that delays in development are effectively recouped on the one hand by simplifying rules and procedures, while maintaining a rigorous pursuit of objectives, and, on the other, by strengthening the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of management and control systems. All this has to take place within the context of the broad and effective involvement of all the institutional, economic and social partnerships at the various local levels in order to identify the strategies and specific and operational objectives to be pursued. In addition to this, there needs to be effective programming and unified implementation by the different EU (structural, agricultural and neighbourhood policy funds) and national funds, recognising in project funding the capacity for integration of the various areas and production and the different private and public entities, including in a cross-border, inter- and intra-regional context. I believe that the report that I helped to approve contains these suggestions. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

Food security is a prerequisite for achieving balanced development at all levels. Its relationship with sustainable production in the primary sector can be seen in a number of different ways. In environmental terms, it is expressed through the use of eco-friendly techniques and products and through a non-speculative enhancement and management of the immense natural resources that are found in developing countries in particular. In economic terms, it is expressed partly by enhancing the competitive advantages between the various areas and countries – which can also enable developing countries to play an integral role in balanced and global growth – and partly by promoting the link with the land through a focus on locally sourced products, where energy costs and pollution linked to transport and the quality and tradition of the products can be better protected. In social terms, the processes of gradual urbanisation and population growth, above all, in developing countries, have to be reconciled with the needs of living in these places. Lastly, in political terms, because the primary and food sectors represent the most tangible, daily platform for relations between people, including in their relationships with institutions. I believe that the report we have adopted upholds this view. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 Economic cooperation, including trade cooperation, is one of the instruments through which foreign policy is implemented. The European Union is founded, first, on sectoral trade and, second, on the wider single market: a foundation that is still suffering from the lack of a single foreign policy; a wide-ranging, strong and authoritative policy that helps to define strategic positions on economic cooperation with other countries and geopolitical regions, as well. This situation allows each Member State to develop in an independent and uncoordinated fashion, either on its own or in the various international organisations to which it belongs. In order to ensure that the Doha negotiations have a favourable outcome, while also reiterating the usefulness of the World Trade Organisation as a forum for solving the problems of balanced development and cohesion among all the member countries, we need to work on integrating the other countries, too, into long-term policies, firstly by building on their competitive advantages, and secondly by strengthening their ability to shape their own development. I believe that the adopted report makes a contribution, however small, to this prospect. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 Economic, social and territorial cohesion policy is one of the fundamental pillars of an EU that is in favour of bridging gaps in the development of geographical areas and sectors of society and the economy. If correctly focused on people and bottom-up subsidiarity, it allows the promotion of integrated, systemic growth, stimulating initiative and civic sense and fostering the development of responsibility and the common good. The experience of the current 2007-2013 programming period has taught that in the next programming period we need above all to give greater responsibility to the actors, beneficiaries and targets of strategic and operational programming, as well as to its implementation, monitoring and the assessment of whether objectives have been met, through programmes providing incentives and disincentives to encourage the meeting of targets and allowing greater transparency in the processes and work involved in active participation in them. It is also important to make the entire structure of governance and management simpler and more flexible, and to foster the capacity for integration of the different territories in a cross-border, inter- and intra-regional sense. Finally, it is necessary for the resources and objectives of cohesion policy in the next programming period to be in line with the challenges the EU will be undertaking, including the EU 2020 strategy. I think that the report I helped to approve shows the right way to do this. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

The internal market, competition policy and fundamental freedoms have accompanied the growth of an open and integrated Europe. The economic vision that led to its creation in the beginning is not the only dimension of a political reality that intends to take part in governing globalisation. This contains other dimensions which generate shared visions and policies which have to make people the focus of their attention. This change of approach makes it even more important to encourage the creation of an economic and social context in which the need to develop one’s own identity and the response to the fundamental needs of daily life and future prospects are what drive public actions. In this context social services of general interest take on a bigger, different role in which the financial aspect, in terms of budget compatibility and medium- and long-term sustainability, play a important part, but only in the context of the primary objective of developing human beings and quality of life in a family, social, working and institutional sense.

 Economic, social and territorial cohesion policy is one of the fundamental pillars of an EU that is conscious not only to promote and develop excellence by encouraging innovation, but also to create convergence and bridge the gaps of and in less developed areas compared with more advanced ones. Joint programming was the most innovative aspect of the period 2007-2013, having led the regions and the Member States to adopt an integrated approach between territories and resources as part of their strategic and operational programming. However, this important approach is liable, in many cases, to be frustrated by the considerable autonomy and strong competition existing between the various authorities in charge of managing each monofund programme. By failing to work together properly, they seriously endanger not only the valuable integration of operations and actions that could be achieved, but also the benefits and the impact that those actions could create. In the next programming period, then, it may be worth reverting to multifund programmes, incorporating in them the experience gained from joint programming and encouraging shared and responsible management between the various stakeholders in charge of regional development. I believe that the adopted report makes an effective contribution to these objectives. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 The agricultural sector still plays a strategic role today in our societies and economies. It does so firstly from a food perspective, since not only does it provide the raw materials for food, but the safety of that food is essential for our health. It does so secondly from an environmental perspective, since the vitality of the sector and the quality of its production processes make for environmentally friendly land management. It does so thirdly from a social perspective, since it represents a challenge to provide high-quality, innovative jobs for young people. It does so fourthly and finally from an economic perspective, since a local/global approach allows for the economic development of traditional, high-quality, certified and high added value products, through the adoption of management models that turn businesses and their products into competitive cooperatives on a global scale. A fair CAP that promotes micro, small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises and high-quality, traditional and certified products, that supports environmentally friendly processes, that introduces aid ceilings and that sets aside sufficient resources for rural development is an ambitious and far-sighted policy that benefits citizens, consumers and agricultural operators. I believe that the adopted report offers this possibility. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

One of the fundamental objectives of the European Union is to link human and social development to economic development. If these two factors are in balance, then this means, on the one hand, that people can do their work with adequate remuneration that is in line with human dignity and professional quality, while, on the other hand, it allows business owners to develop their businesses by following market principles, though tempered by the human environment in which this must take place. This perspective – which some people also call the social market economy – is actually a new paradigm that goes beyond welfare economics and returns instead to the centrality of the human being. Such a paradigm shift necessarily involves consistent support for social policy, including fostering the relevant standards and related corporate responsibility. This approach and vision cannot, and must not, have an impact merely within the EU, but must also be applied to external action wherever possible, particularly during the negotiation of agreements. Respect for International Labour Organisation standards, the principles laid down in the European Social Charter and social dialogue are just some of the areas that can be discussed on these occasions. I believe that the report we have adopted offers sound backing for these objectives. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

Indicators are a concise way of interpreting a given phenomenon. Simple phenomena can be interpreted using simple indicators, while complex phenomena require complex indicators. Gross domestic product is a simple indicator, while development is a complex phenomenon. Indeed, the economic development of an area has various dimensions that are not included in GDP, which takes a snapshot of a given moment. Other elements of interpretation are totally neglected, such as investment in intangible infrastructure, including know-how (people, processes and products, to mention just a few examples), and investment in tangible infrastructure, including communication and transport networks (ICT networks and road and rail networks, for example). In addition, GDP is not even suitable for identifying regions assisted by EU regional cohesion policy. For these reasons, the European Commission’s efforts to go beyond GDP and create a series of data and indicators that will improve its ability to interpret phenomena and help to better define policies and financial allocations should be commended. The report that we have adopted seems to me to be moving in this direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 The economic and financial crisis has highlighted the total lack of ethics in this area. The paradigm of the new welfare economy, whereby the pursuit of individual wellbeing is the key to collective welfare, which is the sum of its parts, is apparent in all its inadequacy. According to this approach, individual interest does not set any limitation on the collective interest, let alone the general interest. Yet because public government must set general interest as a framework within which to operate, and provide free space for freedom and individual rights within it, it must support this with a fair and progressive tax system. Consistent with this approach, which must be supported at global level by the EU and all G8 and G20 countries, the revenue from financial transactions must be made comparable to other revenues through a specific tax system that favours greater responsibility by operators together with other rules and new paradigms. The introduction of Eurobonds designed for the crisis fund and infrastructure projects could strengthen the EU’s ability to take action if they were additional to the EU budget. The report that we have adopted seems to me to be moving, albeit slowly, in this direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 Agriculture represents a strategic sector for the European Union. While its impact in terms of employment and GDP may not equal that of other sectors, it assumes greater significance with regard to the characteristics of our respective regions and food traditions, since it ensures that we are self-sufficient in many ingredients that are essential for our farm produce, traditional or otherwise. Furthermore, this sector plays a fundamental role in safeguarding and protecting the environment and ensuring the sustainable development of our regions. It is obvious that trade agreements have to be made, particularly in the trade rounds of the World Trade Organisation. For that to happen, however, the European Union has to pay more attention to safeguarding quality, traditional and certified products, so that they can be protected internationally to avoid fraud on foreign markets involving products that have been falsely attributed to our countries. The basic tenet of the approved report seems to go in the right direction. Luigi Ciriaco De Mita  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the proposed text because pensions are one of the fundamental institutions of the system of worker’s rights and duties. They are essential for the continuation of a decent standard of living for the people concerned and for their whole families, especially when it comes to receiving adequate support so as to attain a decent standard of personal and family life. By setting this threshold as a long-term goal, it is obvious that sustainable pension systems are necessary to offer certain minimum prospects to workers. While I respect the principle of bottom-up subsidiarity, with primary authority and responsibility for adequacy and opportunity for reform lying with the Member States, there is a need for convergence of pension systems in Europe, so as to ensure full and genuine freedom of movement for workers and enterprises and also full and mutual recognition and parity of the various pension systems within the Member States. Indeed, while I acknowledge the differences in the cost of living and in wage levels between Member States, there is a need to establish long-term convergence both internally within each Member State and within the EU as a whole, so as to promote a decent and adequate level of life expectancy.

The internal market and competition policy are two cornerstones of the process of European unification which aim not only at strengthening the European Union’s economy and its businesses but, above all, at realising the fundamental freedoms of the Union. This objective must be pursued in the interests of all European citizens and enterprises, offering equal opportunities and substantial equality while avoiding problems, additional costs and superstructures that could differentiate, discriminate between or limit the opportunities to enjoy or protect one’s own rights. Giving all European Union citizens the right to express themselves in their own language in dealings with the EU institutions is a fundamental right in terms of equality, equal opportunities and non-discrimination. The use of just some of the official languages can technically only be justified within the activities of the EU institutions and not in its relations with citizens, enterprises and institutions in the Member States. Enhanced cooperation procedures are useful when they increase the opportunities for those that participate in them, without compromising them for the others. I therefore voted against the recommendation since I think enhanced cooperation is unacceptable in such a delicate context as the political equality of languages, as it would create discrimination in terms of the right of equal opportunity to access the EU’s fundamental freedoms.

Humanitarian aid now has a larger and more important role than in the past. Differing rates of development and growing inequality in opportunity and resource distribution in geographical, social and generational terms, increasing climate change (for which humans are partly to blame) and the associated increase in natural disasters, increased environmental pollution, imbalanced anthropic pressure concentrated in large urban areas, and uneven population growth in some areas of the planet, have led to a rising number of humanitarian disasters in which aid takes on an essential role in restoring basic living conditions and human dignity. In view of this, if humanitarian aid is needed to assist people hit by disasters, then in turn, any interventions as a result of EU foreign policy – which is still to be defined – cannot be apportioned according to each Member State’s areas of interest and influence, but should take on a European dimension.

 Agriculture plays a key role in the development of communities. Defining its output as a primary sector in economic terms relates not only to the historical trend of its development, but also, and above all, to its role in stabilising societies and their economies. Balanced agricultural production has to be attentive not only to the quantities produced, but also, and primarily, to the quality of the output, so that it assists in the healthy development of the population. From this perspective, therefore, food security plays a key role, and its protection – particularly in terms of traditional and local produce – increases the opportunities for development throughout the territory. The positive correlation between food security and the quality and healthiness of agricultural products also involves increasing their eco-friendliness, while particular care must be paid to the domino effect caused by the uncontrolled introduction of genetically modified organisms, in order to provide, in the first instance, the necessary certainties as regards the medium- and long-term effects that these products could have on health and local economies.

Greater respect for the role of the European Parliament in the formulation of proposals, taking due account of the positions it assumes in its opinions and proposals for initiatives; 2. Closer and inter-institutionally more balanced cooperation on the budget and on financial prospects; 3. Greater courage in formulating proposals for the efficient use of EU resources that make it possible to achieve binding objectives and concrete benchmarks; 4. effective and incisive EU governance of the economy and finance, as well as financial participation of employees in the success of the company that allow more widespread, balanced and inclusive economic and social development.

In this regard, the single permit voted upon can provide a way to manage entries and safeguard the rights and duties of all the people who make up a community. I supported the proposal for a directive, including the parts that are without prejudice to the more favourable provisions contained in EU legislation and international instruments.

 The Stockholm Programme is an essential next step in the development of the European area of freedom, security and justice towards a greater focus on individuals. A greater focus that contributes not only to a more comprehensive perspective on citizenship, including respect for human beings and human dignity, but also to a perspective on the law and on justice that makes it accessible throughout the Union, so that individuals can exert their rights without any internal borders. A focus on individuals that must be guaranteed across the board, including as regards the growing phenomenon of immigration and asylum, albeit in strict compliance with the rules on civil harmony, including security. The Commission Action Plan is a consistent embodiment of the Stockholm Programme. When developing European areas of freedom, security and justice, however, respect must always be shown for the principle of subsidiarity, which encourages respect for individuals and for the traditions that form an integral part of their history.

 The ongoing economic and financial crisis, in severely affecting the economies of the ‘developed’ countries of the West, has shown that the economic paradigm of the efficiency and capacity for self-regulation of the markets is no longer based on reality, because reality has called for all economic and market players, especially financial market players, to act responsibly and ethically, something which they have completely failed to do in recent times. The disruption caused in financial terms to the entire economy shows that the industrial sector requires a huge amount of support, since it is still a sector of fundamental importance for the economy, especially the real economy. When taking into account the competitive and comparative advantages and disadvantages between regions, especially at international level, we must not forget that the mining industry is present in areas in which the development of sound economic and occupational alternatives should be encouraged as a preliminary step and in which welfare support provisions should be enhanced to prevent painful increases in unemployed workers whom it is difficult to redeploy.

The role of rural development is essential to keep our territories alive, both because of its end product and because it is so widespread. Seen in this context, the livestock sector is one of the most significant for our communities. Indeed, beyond food and economic aspects (though important, and in which regard the quality of the products is ensured by environmentally sustainable techniques), farming represents the most widespread form of occupation, protection and development of rural areas. This is why the European Union – including through the common agricultural policy, above all, in its post-2013, reformed incarnation – and each Member State must promote its continued existence, not only by coming up with innovative techniques for farming and economically and environmentally sustainable management, but also by strengthening their wider role as guardians of the environment and the land protecting them from the market crisis by reducing production costs, making the best of their products and greater organisation on the market.

Justice in relations between generations represents the new global challenge that needs to be adequately tackled. Modern societies have found themselves presiding over a period of constant growth in which, above all in the last few decades, new generations have had better conditions and prospects ahead of them than previous generations. Now, the situation has surpassed the limits of seemingly endless growth and we find ourselves faced with a debate between rights and limited resources. All countries, beginning with the developed and democratic ones and their related organisations (like the EU), must therefore work determinedly, conclusively and cogently to work out policies, make choices and implement them coherently for a greater equilibrium between current and future generations, so that the division and distance between those with rights and those without, and those with resources and those without, may be reduced.

The vote for a legislative motion for a resolution amending Directive 92/85/EEC was taken not only to support new and better measures for the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding but also, more generally, to support new measures to promote a better work-life balance. Even though the Italian legal system is more innovative, the increase in the number of weeks of maternity leave at European level represents a strong boost in favour of family assistance to newborn babies. The support for paternity leave is also a step in the same direction even though making this compulsory is not perhaps the best way to pursue the laudable aim of ensuring the greater effective presence of both parents at the most demanding time for the new household and ensuring the father is more aware and involved. Support for and extension of the rights of adopted children allows a reinforcement and, it is to be hoped, also a simplification of the adoption process. Finally, with a view to striking a better work-life balance, I feel it is also important to have supported the call to Member States to strengthen childhood services with care facilities for children up to the age of compulsory schooling.

 Late payments in commercial transactions between undertakings, and between undertakings and public authorities, are one of the things currently hampering the recovery of economic growth. Approval of the new directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions represents a major innovation that will require appropriate preparation, above all, of the public sector, in both political and administrative terms. In political terms, so that financial and budgetary planning can take account not only of the impact of European Union rules on the Stability and Growth Pact, but now also of the impact of the new rules on late payments, which, if not satisfactorily managed, could have both a direct and reflex effect on the room for manoeuvre of governments at various levels. In administrative terms, appropriate preparation is required for the correct financial management of public bodies, beginning with the ratio between liabilities and expenditure, so that tax revenues and, hence, the people, are not weighed down by burdens such as interest payments which could have a significant effect on public finances. Finally, it seems important for there to be particular awareness and flexibility regarding several sectors, such as the health sector, in which the public authorities have run up significantly late payments owed to undertakings, for regular goods and services provided.

 In the vote on the report by Mrs Gallo on the enforcement of intellectual property rights in the internal market, two mutually complementary rights have been reconciled. One is the particular intellectual property right of the author and/or editor of the item created, and the other is the more general right to knowledge of the users of the item itself. The European Union cannot only be an internal market, where businesses operate and protect the goods and services they provide, but it is also a shared space of citizenship and freedom, in which citizens can express and inform themselves and each other. Making everything bow to private interests, creating excessive, unjustified and unfair limits to the free dissemination of the creations of the intellect could unduly compromise the shared space, where the expression of thought takes on the significance of a public asset. Hence, it is important that intellectual creations are protected, but it is just as important that the methods of their protection are not excessive in order to make them fully available, as easily and quickly as reasonably possible, to the entire community, beginning with the Internet community.

A common foreign policy and a common economic policy are the necessary objectives of the European integration process. It should be remembered that the single currency was also chosen to speed up the integration process, which had come to a standstill in Nice. Given the way in which it is being organised, the European External Action Service is in danger of adopting a paralysing ‘do nothing’ approach, rather than being the start of a virtuous unifying process.

 This proposal for a regulation is blazing a legislative trail on a subject that is fundamental for European Union citizens and enterprises, namely the transparency and dissemination of information on food products. While, on the one hand, it is important to achieve an internal market where all citizens and all enterprises can make the best possible choices, on the other hand, we must take into account the extraordinary heritage of food, wine and gastronomic culture that moulds the traditions of many parts of Europe, thus benefiting health and also economic, social and environmental sustainability. During the process of amending the proposal, both in detail and in broad terms, it has become apparent that the European Parliament, in performing this function so fundamental to the exercising of its responsibilities, is turning into a place where the interest of multinationals are transacted to the detriment of consumers. When faced by this inequality of power, which should be balanced out by the pursuit of public interest by the institution, we can only marvel at the growing public disinterest in the process of European integration. These observations are not motivated by national interests but by the judiciousness of preserving typical local food products and the strong local bond between producers and consumers.
