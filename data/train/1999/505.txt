Mr President, we are at the end of the mandate of the Commission and Parliament and therefore, on this occasion, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Monti on the excellent work he has done throughout the mandate of this Commission. Competition policy, as has been pointed out, is one of the fundamental policies which the Commission is responsible for. Its implementation and application is very difficult and subject to many pressures, I would therefore like once again to congratulate Commissioner Monti on his success in implementing this policy. Nevertheless, there are certain aspects which worry us and which other Members have pointed out. The first, naturally, is that we must not lower our guard. The pressure from economic and political interests to sidestep market rules is logical, and we must always balance, for the benefit of citizens and consumers, the free exercise of market mechanisms in order to ensure an efficient market with a correct allocation of resources. It is therefore obvious that we must counteract these pressures, since it is logical, and we economists know it, that the tendency of any company is to control the market, if it can be done in an oligopolistic way, all very well, but if it can be monopolistic, even better, and in certain sectors there are still very significant distortions, as has been mentioned here. The second point that I would obviously like to point out is the Liberal Group’s traditional position that there should be a section in the Court of Justice to deal with these issues. The third and final point would be to ensure, both in the Commission and in the other institutions of the European Union, that the operation of the courts responsible for competition, at all levels within the Union, is correct. If it is rigorous in certain areas but not in others, we are obviously giving comparative assistance which distorts the situation of the markets, and even more so, as has been pointed out, in view of the enlargement which will take place in a few months’ time. Having made these observations, which I would like to leave as suggestions for application in the future, I would like to repeat that we in the Liberal Group are in agreement with the positions expressed by the rapporteur, Mr Della Vedova, and we congratulate Commissioner Monti on his wonderful work.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office of the Council began his speech in his own language, Gaelic; you also did so, President Cox, at your investiture, as well as the President of Ireland. However, I cannot use mine, Catalan, spoken by more than seven million people, and the Catalan Government and Parliament cannot address the Court of Justice in Catalan on issues relating to the application of European Union law, which makes up 80% of our legislation. My request, therefore, since you have a particular understanding of what it means to defend the identity of a people and a country in Europe, is that the European Constitution, which you have committed yourself to promoting, should take account of the rights of these peoples, their languages, their cultures and also the constitutional regions. There are many references for it and many reasons to defend it.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Commission Communication on the World Summit on the information society raises more questions than answers. It is clearly good to analyse at world level what is perhaps the best expression of globalisation, that is, a society which, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, is most characterised by our treatment and dissemination of information. The Commissioner has given us an excessively brief description of the results of the World Summit and we must therefore consider the issue on two levels. Firstly, within the European Union itself, given that making progress on and the use of the technologies on which the information society is based are absolutely essential to achieving the Lisbon objectives and turning the European Union into the most economically and socially advanced society by 2010. And secondly, at external level, where there are a series of elements which have been mentioned, such as intellectual property, free access to communications, security of information, digital solidarity, the use of the information society to rebalance the differing levels in the least-favoured societies, etc. I would say simply, in summary, that this World Summit has served to promote much more intensive action within the European institutions and also, obviously, to stimulate debate before the next World Summit takes place and to assess the issues raised here.

Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, of the various aspects dealt with in this debate, I would like to comment on the following: firstly, there has unquestionably been a serious crisis in the application of the bases of monetary union and the euro, which damage their credibility. Secondly, I would take up the famous phrase that the European Union has been built on the basis of crisis and we should learn the lesson from this crisis, particularly in relation to an aspect which has already been mentioned by Commissioner Solbes, and which I fully support, which consists of having a genuine direction for economic policy, something that he has called European governance. We have an asymmetric situation in a monetary policy which is much better defined than the economic policy. I hope that this crisis will serve to provide us with this economic governance which this Parliament has always called for, and most recently, if you will allow me to be immodest, in my report on the international role of the euro.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to place the emphasis on an important aspect of the preparation of the Naples meeting and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Italian Presidency on having paid particular attention, as is very logical, to the Mediterranean dimension of the European Union’s policy. It is a question of enhancing and applying the Euro-Mediterranean investment and association fund, based on credits from the European investment bank, in order to facilitate private investment and private enterprise. As chairman of the Mediterranean Committee of the European League for Economic Cooperation, for years I have been analysing the economic causes of the backwardness of the third countries of the Mediterranean in order to eliminate the imbalances with the European Union. This is a key aspect, that is, ensuring growth based on entrepreneurial spirit and taking advantage of the potential in those societies is fundamental in order to eliminate the existing imbalances. We believe that the fight against imbalances, against economic and social backwardness is largely based on economic development founded on entrepreneurial and private initiative and I therefore propose that particular attention be paid to this and that we follow recommendation no. 7.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join other Members in expressing my approval, not only of the three reports we are discussing here but also of the Commission’s proposals. The main aspects of the Commission’s proposals and of the reports have been highlighted, but I would like to insist on the aspects which appear to me to be fundamental. Firstly, the slowness of the process implemented on the basis of these proposals, which are very positive in terms of relaunching and achieving operational unity in the major communications networks and which, as the Commissioner has quite rightly stressed, within the context of enlargement, are very necessary. There is therefore an essential need to respond to this reality and at the same time to fulfil the Lisbon commitments. But, unfortunately – and we see this in practice – there are obstacles to fully attaining these objectives, some of which – as has been pointed out – are highlighted in the White Paper by the former President of the Commission, Mr Delors. There are basically two of these obstacles; the lack of discipline and commitment on the part of the Member States, a significant obstacle which distorts the market in these fields and, in particular, in the telecommunications fields, which is the issue dealt with in the report by Mr Clegg; and secondly, the financial difficulties in supporting and developing these major networks of communications, telecommunications and electronic services, in the case we are now considering. Overcoming these two obstacles will clearly be the competence and responsibility of the Commission, but in this task it has the support of this Parliament and the Liberal Group which I represent.

Mr President, in the European Union there is a network of so-called rural carrefours
, which basically provide European citizens involved in this issue in rural areas with information on agricultural policies. There are 138 in collaboration with public and private bodies, none of them profit-making, and they have been very surprised by a decision of the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Press and Communication, of 29 September, which withdraws the aid they were receiving to meet the operating costs of these rural centres or carrefours
. I believe that this Parliament should express its concern, because one of the most important resources we have for coming closer to the citizens is currently being seriously hindered by this Commission decision. I would ask you, therefore, to intervene in relation to this issue and to ensure the good functioning of these centres, for the sake of informing citizens in these rural areas and the European Union’s agricultural policies.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposed European Constitution represents undeniable progress in the process of European construction and I fully agree with the assessment of my colleague from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, Mr Andrew Duff, in this regard. However, we Catalan Members from Convergencia i Unió
 will abstain. The reason is that an aspect which is fundamental to us, and I believe also to many European citizens, has not been considered as fully as we had asked for. The peoples of Europe who are identifiable as stateless nations, or in regions with a strong personality and sense of identity, have not been associated in the manner we called for. It is true that the draft Constitution takes up certain principles which we believe to be valid, but it does not include the guarantees we called for in order to associate the regions with full legislative powers with the European institutions, nor does it guarantee that they have access to the Court of Justice, nor does it ensure the inclusion in its linguistic system of languages which are official in the Member States. That means that a language such as Catalan – which will be the eighth most widely-spoken in the enlarged Union – lacks and will lack the Union’s official recognition and there will be no guarantee that it will have it. I would insist that we recognise the positive elements of this Constitution and the inclusion of the principles relating to cultural and linguistic diversity and the principle of subsidiarity for the regions, which we believe to be very important, and a modest degree of progress in terms of the competences of the Committee of the Regions. However, for the reasons I have given, we shall reserve our definitive vote for the result of the Intergovernmental Conference.

Mr President, as you know, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has voted basically in favour of the Gil-Robles/Tsatsos report and the proposed European Constitution offered by the European Convention. As I stated in the debate, however, the Catalan Members of Convergencia i Unió
 cannot accept this position and we have stated that we will abstain. Having seen how the votes have unfolded, furthermore, we confirm with even more conviction our decision to abstain and to wait to establish our final position until the result of the draft European Constitution, which may be presented by the Intergovernmental Conference. We regret in particular that the Group of the European Peoples’ Party and the Group of the Party of European Socialists have voted against our proposals to recognise and associate the regions with full legislative powers with the institutions of the Union, and also that the idea that the Ombudsmen of the parliaments of these regions with full legislative powers should be associated with the work of the European Ombudsman has been rejected. I believe this is a mistake, since it leaves millions of citizens far from the reality which is closest to them. This is the case for, amongst others, the stateless nations and the regions with a strong personality and sense of identity, and I believe it goes entirely against our stated aim of being closer to the citizens and building a Europe of the peoples.

 It is my pleasure to explain why I voted for the Ebner report, given the far-reaching significance of promoting, respecting and also, where necessary, protecting the languages which enrich the European Union’s cultural and linguistic heritage and which ought to bring to life the motto of the draft Constitution for Europe, ‘United in diversity’. Moreover, those languages are the central nucleus of the linguistic and cultural rights recognised by that draft Constitution and also by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. With that in mind, I want to draw attention in particular to the need to add the official languages of the Member States to the list of official languages of the Union. An example from within the Spanish state is Catalan, a language spoken in an area containing ten million inhabitants, and recognised by Parliament, in the Reding report, as deserving special treatment given its importance and standing at the heart of the European Union. It is a sad fact that successive Spanish Governments have failed to champion the official languages recognised by the relevant Statutes of Autonomy, earmarking for development the principles and rights of the Spanish Constitution itself. For that reason, it is very important that it should be the European Union that recognises and protects these languages, over and above the positions of governments.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the assessment we made in December of last year, the situation in Cuba has only worsened. All the proposals for cooperation, for promoting openness, democratic transition and economic support have come up against a brick wall of intolerance, rejection and, what is worse, a response which, as has been said, affects dozens of members of the Cuban opposition, independent journalists and human rights activists. This situation requires a categorical response and, as has been requested here, a unanimous and very clear response on the part of the institutions of the European Union, in order to promote the democratic process and, fundamentally, to guarantee human rights – some of which are as essential and important to a society as the exercise of freedom of expression. I believe we must make every effort and continue to do so in order firstly to demonstrate the position of the European institutions – this is expressed very clearly in this joint resolution, which I hope will be approved by the European Parliament today – and secondly to demonstrate our cooperation and solidarity with the members of the opposition who wish to see a free and democratic Cuba, with the activists and defenders of human rights working through the respective non-governmental organisations, demonstrating our particular concern for the leader to whom we awarded the Sakharov Prize, Mr Oswaldo Payá, and in order to contribute to preventing, as far as possible, the suffering of the Cuban population, who are the main victims of the current situation.

rapporteur
. – (ES)
 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President of the European Central Bank, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which I have the honour of representing, could not have come at a more appropriate time. This report is based on the one drawn up by the European Commission, assessing the first four years of the euro and also, as has been pointed out, on another report on the use of euro notes and coins. The euro has been introduced in a very short time, but has proven its solidity and stability. The European Central Bank and its President, Mr Duisenberg, must be congratulated on the euro’s sound management and we must thank him, in his last appearance in plenary, and extend our best wishes for the future, hoping that he enjoys them in the company of his grandchildren, who have only known the euro as the single currency. The introduction of the euro, its increasing acceptance and its appreciation towards the dollar, inevitably lead us to consider its role at international level, which is the main theme of the report. At the Thessaloniki European Council, the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, stated that working on the external representation of the euro is absolutely crucial. The report attempts to respond to this need articulated by President Prodi, and proposes principally that the euro should have a single representation in the international financial institutions, and also that this representation should be enhanced at international level. The report does not go further, because we believe that there must be a broad consensus and, obviously, the relevant arrangements in line with this principle must be studied and adopted in the appropriate international forums. There is a suggestion, however, made by Mrs Peijs, to be specific, before her appointment as minister in the new Dutch government, which is to use the type of post that has already been adopted and proposed by the European Convention, of a European Minister for External Affairs. The same could apply to a Minister for European Economic and Monetary Affairs who would, at international level, represent the euro on the basis of a formula contained in a proposal from Ecofin, which the Commission has obviously accepted. This ‘Mr Euro’ or ‘Ms Euro’ would also hold the post of Vice-President of the European Commission. I repeat that this is a suggestion, for a post that has already been adopted and proposed in the Convention, and which appears to be accepted at political level, even by the European Council itself and we therefore believe it to be a valid alternative. In an article that appeared recently in the Financial Times
, Martin Wolf said that the Eurozone will very soon be larger than the dollar zone and attributes this to the credibility and soundness of the economy and of the economies that are joining the Eurozone. Obviously, this solidity and credibility are the result of complying with the stability and growth pacts, which it is absolutely crucial to pursue and abide by. We refer to this aspect – compliance with and the need to comply with the stability and growth pacts – as a component and guarantee of the euro’s soundness, credibility and stability, and we study, as one would expect, the use of the euro at international level in various fields and, in particular, on the international financial markets, and its use by our new neighbours, including Russia and the Baltic States. We also refer to the euro’s potential for ensuring greater stability in the supply of raw materials which are extremely important, because of their dependence on the European economy. We believe that energy supply should be paid for in euros. We also refer to the growing number of central banks around the world that are increasing their euro reserves. To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I shall simply recall that in the report we also study some suggestions and propose a study to be undertaken by the European Central Bank and the central banks that are members of the euro zone, on some aspects of the use of notes and coins, to which Mrs Randzio-Plath has already referred.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports Mr García-Margallo y Marfil’s report. We believe it rightly emphasises the importance of providing a more appropriate framework to ensure that the objectives set in the various stability pacts and the main broad guidelines of economic policy are attained. The stability and credibility of the Union’s economy and its single currency are at stake. Over the last few days we have become very much aware of social unrest resulting from essential proposals to reform pensions systems. Reform is needed to guarantee pensions and associated benefits. These are integral parts of the welfare state system characteristic of the European Union. The Union provides and guarantees the best social protection and the greatest social balance when compared to other large economies. If it is to preserve that balance, the European Union must make a more determined effort to take the action many have called for in recent times. During the preparations for the Spring European Council in Brussels under the current Greek Presidency, we highlighted two shortcomings. The first was failure to attain the Lisbon objectives. The second concerned the need to tackle a number of outstanding structural reforms mentioned in Mr García-Margallo y Marfil’s report. Action on these is certainly needed. I should like to reiterate the importance of this area. It encompasses a number of unresolved key issues which are therefore still holding back economies and their development at European level. Liberalisation of some sectors is one area where action is outstanding. Another is failure to adopt technological innovation. Research and development is not being promoted adequately either. Further, as Mr García-Margallo y Marfil pointed out, it has now become urgent to give priority to SMEs, especially to those with the most potential for growth and innovation. It is well known that large corporations tend to shed jobs when times are hard. This is happening at the moment. It is actually the SMEs that create more employment and stimulate economic recovery. I would emphasise once again that such recovery must take place within a strict framework and budgetary balance. It is also essential to attain the objectives set in the stability pacts. These are an integral part of the framework on which the European Union and the euro are based and from which they will develop. We cannot afford to restrict or weaken it.

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I do not agree with my fellow Member, Mr Goebbels, on the first aspect. I believe we have to maintain the discipline established in the Stability Pacts because it gives the European Union a solidity and credibility which are greater than those of the United States, which, in the analysis of economies at international level shows a deficit which is causing great concern. I would like to insist on the need for there to genuinely be effective coordination and effective compliance with the commitments established in the Stability Pacts on the part of the Member States and I believe, on the basis of the proposals that have been made here, that if the Commission does not have greater capacity to influence this compliance in an area such as the use of tax policy, for example, the certainty that the objectives will be achieved is really very limited. I would insist, and I believe Parliament generally supports this, on the degree of compliance and fulfilment of the Member States’ commitments, since, as the current situation demonstrates, unfortunately there are certain very important States which, rather than moving closer, are moving further away in terms of providing credibility and solvency.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regardless of the agreements we may reach next Thursday on the resolution on Cuba, I would ask you to take urgent personal action to deal with the situation of the 78 people arrested, accused of conspiracy on the basis of Cuba’s 1999 law on the protection of national independence and the economy. According to a Spanish newspaper the main accusation against one of the people arrested, Raúl Rivero, is conspiracy by means of a subversive French agency, Reporters sans Frontières
. This demonstrates the current paranoia of the Castro dictatorship. Since, furthermore, they are subject to entirely summary trials, I believe it is urgent that you intervene so that the situation and conditions being experienced by the accused may improve.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to endorse the statements made by Mr Watson, the leader of my group. I join with him in condemning the conflict in Iraq and calling for agreements within the framework of the United Nations, of course. I also join with him in wishing to commit the European Union to regaining its unity. The Union must then contribute to rebuilding the affected areas so a process of peace and stability can actually be consolidated and guaranteed. The European Union was unable to demonstrate the unity required. Sadly, it was therefore unable to exert its influence as we had hoped. I trust that at least we shall now be capable of first regaining our unity and then of leading the peace. I should also like to congratulate the Greek Presidency on the results of the Brussels Council held last week. The Council was devoted in particular to consideration of the so-called Lisbon process. During debates and discussion at Strasbourg it had already emerged that we have little to congratulate ourselves on in this regard. In terms of productivity and competitiveness, the gap between Europe and the United States has not narrowed. On the contrary, it is now actually widening. As we understand it, the reason is that the appropriate structural reforms were not carried out. Also, the discipline promised concerning key aspects such as the promotion of research and development activities failed to materialise. New enterprises capable of taking on board innovation and new technological processes were not encouraged either. Obviously, all this has hampered the development hoped for. I believe the secret of effective implementation of the Lisbon process commitments lies in the area of structural reform. It is equally important to promote research and development activities and the activities of small and medium-sized enterprises, in conjunction with proposals for social improvements. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would firstly like to express my group’s agreement with the text of the reports we are discussing, but not with some of the statements which have been made on presenting them to this plenary session. The immediate aim of this debate is essentially to prepare for the Spring Council and it is intended to respond to the corresponding assessment of the so-called ‘Lisbon process’, complemented by the decisions of the Gothenburg and Barcelona Councils. Within this context, I would firstly like to express my concern and that of my group at the fact that the aim established for 2010 of being a more competitive economy with higher quality and greater levels of employment has not been achieved. When assessing these three years, despite the difficulties of the American economy, we find that, in terms of growth, productivity levels and employment levels, we are further behind than three years ago. It is therefore clear that there is a very worrying difference between what is preached in the Councils and what is practiced in the Member States, and this prejudices the Union’s overall result. We in the Liberal Group believe that the main problems principally stem from the lack of compliance with the liberalisation processes agreed, since, as the report by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil points out, there are still significant structural reforms to be carried out and certain basic markets, such as the labour market, must be made even more flexible. In the current situation, which is not exactly one of the best economic situations the European Union has been in in recent years, there are three key aspects which particular attention must also be paid to. Firstly, we must improve the level not just of research and development but of its application within the productive system. Let us hope that this historic agreement on the European patent, as Commissioner Solbes has mentioned, will provide promotion in this area, but that it will also pay special attention to the creation and development of small and medium-sized businesses based on the application of new technologies, because, as was demonstrated in the 1990s, they are significant sources of work. I do not have the time to mention other issues, Mr President, but I would like to end as I began: rather than making grand statements in Spring Councils, we must comply with what has been agreed.
Gasòliba i Böhm (ELDR

 – (ES) 
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, much has been said during this debate and it is obviously difficult at this point to add anything new. I will therefore insist on the aspects which the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party considers to be most important in this preparation for the Spring Summit. Firstly, on assessing the results so far since Lisbon, we observe that, rather than making progress – at least in relative terms – we have moved backwards. If we compare the levels of productivity in the European Union and in the United States we see that the European Union comes out worse. We believe that this is because we have not been able to make sufficient progress on a framework favourable to business initiative for investment. This is because, despite the declarations made at the successive Councils in Lisbon, Gothenburg and Barcelona, there has not been adequate action on the part of the Member States, which have committed themselves to making a series of reforms, of which the really important ones are reforms to make the labour market more flexible, to promote an environment more favourable for the creation of companies, at a time when growth forecasts within the European Union are low. Small and medium-sized enterprises are key, but it has been demonstrated that the bureaucratic obstacles to creating a new business are infinitely greater in the European Union than in the United States. This is not a favourable environment either for the creation of companies or for small and medium-sized businesses or, above all, for those companies which are taking a new direction by applying new technologies. Therefore, the twin objective of creating companies and applying and developing new technologies has also been significantly delayed and clearly, despite the successive commitments and solemn declarations, which were repeated in Barcelona, on the process of liberalisation of sectors which are still protected, in energy and telecommunications we see once again that they have not been fulfilled. I therefore hope that rather than making great declarations, the Brussels Summit will fulfil its commitments.

Mr President, I am speaking to propose that this Parliament express its condemnation and rejection of the farcical presidential elections which took place in Equatorial Guinea. The lack of democratic guarantees and the obligation for the voters to indicate how they had voted led all the opposition candidates to withdraw their candidatures two hours after the beginning of the false electoral process. As you know, the current government of Teodoro Obiang did not allow the presence of observers from this Parliament nor international observers at these elections and, therefore, we believe that there are ample reasons for expressing a very firm and categorical condemnation of this electoral parody, which reflects the dictatorship suffered by the people of Guinea. Therefore, in the expectation that the plenum will express its opinion, we believe that, by means of its President or whatever channels he deems appropriate, we must express our condemnation of the lamentable electoral farce which took place yesterday.

 Mr President, I would like to express my support for Commissioner Bolkestein’s analysis, ten years after the creation of the European internal market, which originated in the Single European Act, which first amended the Treaties, in the belief that we needed to create an economic area that matched our economic capacity and European companies’ development possibilities. Unfortunately, a number of aspects, which have just been listed, are as yet unresolved – the lack of agreement on the European patent, takeover bids, tax obstacles, financial services – and these should drive the Council to make good its commitments and effectively implement all the agreements and commitments instigated in the Lisbon process so that we do not have to wait another ten years for the entire European internal market to become a reality.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise certain points that have already been raised. I would stress the support of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, first of all, for speeding up negotiations and achieving a new agreement, which certainly meets the planned schedule and, if possible, speeds it up in order to send a positive message with regard to the good will of the European Union in this integration process. Positive signals have already been sent, including Commission aid of EUR 200 million, which we believe should be supplemented, as stated in the motion for a joint resolution. The use of preferential commercial mechanisms should also be used in order to promote commerce and economic recovery in the region. We believe that this process of greater integration and greater cooperation by the European Union, in conjunction with international financial bodies, should be used to carry out and consolidate the search for robust, credible, rigorous economic programmes to restore confidence in both economic recovery and in investment flow, which the Mercosur economies, and in particular Argentina, clearly need in order to overcome the serious economic, social and political situation they are currently experiencing. We also believe that in the various references that have been made to international financial institutions and to the International Monetary Fund in particular, the Argentine crisis, once again, shows the need for the European Union to act more directly, with its own voice, to address this type of subject within these bodies.

Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya
 and Coalición Canaria
, we would like to say that the achievements listed by the President-in-Office of the Council represent significant achievements, from the Galileo programme to the liberalisation of the energy sector, achieved in Barcelona, to the control of illegal immigration and the consolidation of the status of the outermost regions, in Seville. However, we do not consider that these advances have sufficiently fulfilled the objectives set at the start of the Presidency with the slogan “more Europe". In the field of immigration we need greater attention to cooperation and integration policies; in enlargement, we need more success in the reform of the CAP and of the financial resources; in institutional reforms, we need the Commission’s and Parliament’s proposals to be more in tune with each other. On international matters, and despite the progress and the meetings in Valencia, Madrid and Seville, we have lacked presence and results in the interventions in the Latin American crises, the common position on Cuba, the process of decolonisation of the Sahara and the Middle East crisis. In short, we note the progress and good management of the Spanish Presidency, but we would have liked to celebrate “more Europe” when making this assessment.

 Mr President, I shall very briefly put three observations to the President-in-Office of the Council, the President of the Commission, and my fellow Members, the first of which concerns immigration. I think the evidence should lead us to believe that we should establish in Seville a policy that has been asked for since Tampere, that is truly effective at European level, that has a European dimension and that also establishes and intensifies a real political dimension to the European Union. This is a subject which, through the intergovernmental method, has sadly been postponed for too long. The second observation I would like to make is that account should also be taken of the external dimension that causes immigration, and that the cooperation mechanisms must therefore be strengthened far more than they have been to date. I believe that one topic should be resolved in Seville: the evident distancing of the positions expressed by the Commission over the past few months from the Commission proposals and their reception by the Council. I think that, specifically, Mr de Miguel has commented on the importance attached to the Convention; it would be good to wait for the results of the Convention before making a series of proposals which seem to rather distort the context in which the Intergovernmental Conference would subsequently have to state its position. Lastly, allow me to note that in Laeken the seats of many agencies of the European Union were not decided on. I would like to know whether this area will be covered in Seville.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to express the support of the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party for the two reports by Mr Trentin and Mr Marinos, which deal with two key issues within the excessively complicated EU economic and monetary policy mechanism, of which the stability pacts and the broad economic policy guidelines are key components. I would like to highlight the following points: firstly, that we fully support the policy of budgetary rigour and the fulfilment of commitments established in the stability pacts. Therefore, we regret very much that the Member States, in the Ecofin Council in February, if my memory serves me correctly, did not support the Commission proposal with regard to the concern for the development of the Portuguese and German economies and the administration of their respective budgets. I would also add our concern at the French Government’s recent announcement. Therefore, I support the policy of budgetary rigour that will hopefully give confidence and strength to the European economy and its single currency, the euro. Lastly, I would like to point out that with regard to the broad economic policy guidelines, we agree with the Trentin report’s proposals, particularly where they aim to implement the Lisbon commitments after revision in the Barcelona Council. We particularly agree with the difficult compromise between achieving greater competitiveness whilst not abandoning the policy of economic and social cohesion. Clearly, this can only be achieved by putting an emphasis – as the Trentin report does, and as proposed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – on the information society and the expansion of technological research and development activities. This will clearly give rise to the information- and knowledge-based society that will allow us to improve quality and be more competitive, which we hope for at the end of this decade.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to join with other honourable Members in expressing my grief at the murder of Professor Biagi, and unequivocally condemning terrorism. With regard to the outcome of the Barcelona European Council, I believe it has been positive, as the Liberal Group stated. The results do indeed fall short of the Presidency’s expectations. On the other hand, enough has been achieved to conclude that definite progress was made. There are also clear commitments to work towards the objectives set at Lisbon. Both the President of the Council and the President of the Commission have already spelt these out. I should however say that this morning I discussed these issues in the Committee on Economic Affairs with Professor Issing of the European Central Bank’s Executive Committee. We agreed that the progress made is welcome, but we also agreed that it is inadequate. This is because it falls short of what is required to ensure that the Lisbon commitments are met. I refer in particular to the structural reforms needed. It is not yet absolutely certain that the targets set will be met. You will recall these targets, namely a sustainable economy, competitive at global level, based on growth and ensuring economic and social cohesion. The progress made is also insufficient to consolidate the incipient growth currently noted. This growth should of course translate precisely into confidence that those structural changes will be carried out. I believe I have exhausted the time at my disposal, but I would like to draw attention to the fact that a warning call was sounded at Barcelona. It concerned the alienation of public opinion and what is doubtless a distorted image of the European Union. This came across clearly. We need to make an effort to put things right. Refocusing the Council’s work is on the agenda for Seville. I believe this is essential. We should also bear in mind that regions enjoying full legislative capacity ought to be involved in order to bring all parties together. After all, they are closer to the citizens.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I would firstly like to express our support for Mr Trentin’s report. It is a very well-produced report which has sought a consensus. We have been able to work together and the result will reflect the efforts we have made throughout its drawing up in committee. This report could not have come at a more appropriate time: the day after tomorrow the Barcelona European Council will take place and it will deal with issues relating to the assessment to be made and the commitments to be assumed in relation to the Lisbon process, as well as, clearly, a series of issues which the Liberal Group has always insisted on and which the Commissioner is sufficiently aware of and which I am not going to repeat: the need to liberalise the most protected sectors; the opening up of the markets; the emphasis on training and education: the provision of more resources for scientific research and technological development; that is, the fulfilment of the Lisbon objectives. We hope that clear progress will be made on this issue at this meeting in Barcelona. I would like to point out that the report by Mr Trentin does not exactly establish a social dimension, which is also included in the Lisbon objectives and that, unfortunately, they are not taken into account and, therefore, I believe that the demonstrations which have been organised against the Europe of capital – of this Europe which we are building and which is a reality – lack justification.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we in the Liberal Group support the general approach and objectives presented by the Spanish Presidency for the Barcelona meeting and we were able to discuss them in detail when Vice-President Rato y Figaredo appeared before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Nevertheless, I would like to make a few comments. One is that we believe that, by the end of the Barcelona European Council, there must be a timetable for the objectives set. Two years have passed since Lisbon and the truth is that, if we look at the evolution of productivity levels, for example, the evolution of the economy itself, not in absolute terms, but in comparison with the United States, or the failure to achieve certain fundamental objectives such as the liberalisation of certain sectors which are still over-protected and which clearly distort competition, the results of this process are not so far satisfactory. Therefore, in order to make the meeting of the European Council credible, in addition to creating another list of things to be done, as has often been said, we must establish a clear relationship between the objectives and the timetable.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Maystadt, President of the European Investment Bank. My colleague, Olle Schmidt, the rapporteur, has already expressed the opinion of the Committee on Economic Affairs on the annual report of the EIB and has presented proposals which, according to our committee, would improve its operation and also meet the need to provide it with greater resources to fulfil its commitments. I would like to draw your attention to a very specific and topical point. In Laeken it was agreed that the EIB would carry out a study to create a financial instrument or institution which would guarantee that, in terms of the cooperation between the European Union and the third countries of the Mediterranean, the level of use of resources responds to the effectiveness and possibilities for development cooperation that the situation demands. We know that in the Mediterranean, in the medium term, very serious conflicts may arise with the European Union itself, and that in order to ensure our own peace and stability in the future it is necessary to strengthen this cooperation and ensure better application of resources which, according to the experience of the first MEDA programme, has only been 30%. Therefore, this initiative agreed at Laeken, of presenting a proposal or alternatives to increase the level of application, seems to us absolutely essential and urgent. Also, if this could be consolidated at the next meeting of the Special Council of Barcelona, we believe that it would be even more appropriate, because the whole issue of development cooperation with the Mediterranean was born in 1995 in Barcelona, under the Spanish Presidency. The current Presidency of the Council has also considered the issue of cooperation with the Mediterranean to be an urgent priority and we decisively support this initiative.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, I would like firstly to congratulate Mr von Wogau on the wonderful work he has done on this report. This report and the statements made about it by both the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and Commissioner Bolkestein, free up a process which has really prevented the speed that we would have liked in the negotiation of projects and the proposals for the creation of an internal market in the financial sector. In the little time remaining for me, I would like to focus on two aspects. Firstly, once we have freed up the process by means of the agreement that today’s debate represents, what we have to do is get to work. That is to say, we have to make the 42 directives envisaged a reality, by 2003 in the case of the capital market and by 2005 in the case of financial services. Secondly, I would like to point out that the European Parliament has never created obstacles when it has been asked for speed, urgency and cooperation in the implementation of projects and issues of such importance as the implementation of the euro or the European internal market itself, which are two very important successes of European construction. The Commission has not normally created obstacles, nor has Parliament, and if we have ever been faced with obstacles, it has been in the Council. In other words, everybody must fulfil their responsibilities.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to stress the support of the Liberal Group and of my party, Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya
, in order to ensure that this Presidency ends with a positive assessment, with distinction, which will include it in the category of the two previous Spanish Presidencies. Of the issues mentioned as priorities for the present Presidency, I would like to stress the following three. That the meeting of the Barcelona European Council, in March, provides concrete commitments and results which can be confirmed, in order to ensure the effective implementation of the structural reforms and liberalisation processes necessary for complying with the objectives set in the process initiated at the Lisbon Council. That the Euro-Mediterranean Council serves to promote a new stage in the process begun, also under a Spanish Presidency, in Barcelona in 1995, in order to ensure greater and better cooperation between the European Union and the third countries of the Mediterranean. We are in favour of the creation of a financial institution which allows the full and effective application of the funds agreed for the Mediterranean programmes. We must intensify the Union’s external policy, in which much of its future peace and stability is at stake. In your key role as a member of the Praesidium of the Convention, we ask that you ensure the incorporation and participation of the constitutional regions in the institutions of the European Union in the constituent text to be agreed at the Intergovernmental Conference of 2004. As the chairman of the Liberal Group stressed in his speech, the European Union cannot be considered complete unless it includes the full participation and integration of the Europe of the Regions. It is an issue to which, under the Spanish Presidency, which will begin with the Convention, we attach the greatest importance, as has been stressed.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Liberal Group I would like to support the position expressed by the Chairperson of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the issue we are debating. I am pleased that Commissioner Bolkestein has said that he is willing to discuss the content of the proposed synthesis report in committee, since it must be the basis for a discussion at a meeting which we hope will be very important and which will take place in my city and the city of the President for this sitting. We therefore have a special interest in Barcelona being a genuine success and that it be remembered as a truly significant advance in terms of the commitments we have been taking on since the meeting in Lisbon last year. I would like to insist on one aspect which both the Commission and the Liberal Group have been highlighting. This is the need to consolidate and clarify the mechanisms and objectives in the field of economic and monetary policy. There is a degree of confusion, as you know, and this has been discussed both in the Commission and in this House, between the Europe of the euro (which, as the Commissioner has said, is now close to completing its final stage with the introduction of notes and coins), the external representation of the euro and, on the other hand, the system for adopting decisions in the field of economic and monetary policy. We know that this situation is unsatisfactory and the current crisis highlights this. We hope that the present situation can be genuinely overcome, in the way that Commissioner Bolkestein’s colleague, Commissioner Solbes, has often said optimistically. However, at the same time he has been obliged to lower the growth forecasts. I would therefore like to insist on this aspect and on another which the Commissioner has not mentioned and which I believe is very important within the various elements of Lisbon and their subsequent implementation: the training and technology element. Lisbon set the objective of a fully competitive society by 2010, in which we would be able to overcome our technological and scientific backwardness in comparison with the United States, which was the term of reference established in Lisbon. I believe that this is an element which also has to be introduced into this synthesis report, and at subsequent meetings views have been expressed in agreement with this.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my intervention by agreeing with Mrs Berès’s complaint, because it really makes no sense to have held a debate, which is otherwise very interesting, on the Growth and Stability Pact and on the conclusions of the ECOFIN in Liège, to have debated ‘television without frontiers’ in the middle and now to hold what I believe to be a logical continuation of the first debate, the reports by Mrs Berès and Mrs Peijs, to whom I would like to say, on behalf of the Liberal Group, that they have our support and favourable vote. I feel compelled to relate this afternoon’s debate to the subjects of these reports, above all by referring to the current economic situation. It is clear that over the first few months of this year, the slow-down of the American economy has had more influence than was initially expected, and that the terrible terrorist attacks on New York and Washington have further worsened these prospects through needs for economic intervention which are truly new, urgent and no doubt justified. The strain of the situation, however, should not lead us to justify greater public intervention or, as the President-in-Office of the Council has said very correctly, to abandon or lose sight of the need to continue with the structural reforms which the European economy still needs if it is really going to be competitive on an international level. I trust that confidence will be recovered in the economic field as soon as possible and that the current special situation will be overcome, and we will shortly find that we have the same requirements that we had three months ago, that is, to consolidate the European economy, to make it more competitive in accordance with the Lisbon criteria, to strengthen coordination and, as we have often said to Commissioner Solbes, to have a genuine economic and monetary approach and policy, as the existence of the euro and monetary union demands. Ladies and gentlemen, this is my basic point, although there are other detailed matters which are sufficiently well-expressed in the respective reports by Mrs Berès and Mrs Peijs.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would firstly like to say that I am in favour of the two reports, which provide us with a good analysis of the application of both the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds in 1999. On the basis of the analysis contained in these two reports, I would like to refer to three points. The first is obvious: the cohesion policy comes within European Union policy and a fundamental element of that cohesion policy is the funds which we are discussing here. The regions which are at a lower level than the European Union average cannot do without these funds, with or without enlargement. It is therefore inherent to the European Union’s cohesion policy that the least-developed regions of the Union receive funds and resources so that they can try to eliminate the current territorial imbalances. As has been said, there is still a budgetary margin in the Union which can be used to meet these needs. The second point is that these reports refer to 1999. There are a series of criticisms about application, which should be taken into account. Let us hope that in 2001, thanks to the action of the Commissioner and his team, the restrictions and shortcomings pointed out may be eliminated. Thirdly, we must bear in mind that the series of statistics analysed and the studies done on the long-term application of the funds in the European Union, with very few exceptions, demonstrate that in the least-favoured regions the level of imbalance in relation to the European Union average has been reduced. Therefore, since we are talking about the future application of these funds, this must be taken into account in the Union’s new policies in this field.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to speak in this debate dealing with a key proposal for the process of European construction. The possibility of having a genuine European limited liability company is in line with the thinking which has led us to a European internal market, to a monetary union and to the last phase of the full use of the euro, which we are now approaching. Nevertheless, as one of the rapporteurs has pointed out, it has taken us thirty years to arrive at this thinking – a little more than thirty years – from the first proposal, in 1970, until now. My observation on behalf of the Liberal Group has two aspects to it: on the one hand, we will of course support the proposal; we believe that it represents a step forward within the achievements of the process of the European construction. We must also say, however, on the other hand, that we are not satisfied. As the proposed amendments to both reports point out, the structure proposed for the creation of a European limited liability company is still too complex. There are various options and the possible varieties of European company may even arise within a single Member State. It is now thought that if the different methods and options are taken into account and a combined calculation is made, up to two hundred different figures may be reached. We do not believe that this is the most appropriate way to consolidate a European company which would act in accordance with the reality which we have achieved thanks to the European internal market and the monetary union. We have therefore also presented a series of amendments on behalf of the Liberal Group aimed at consolidating this key figure for the Economic and Monetary Union and we would very much like the Council to accept them.

Commissioner, as the rapporteur some years ago of a report on the European Union’s competition policy, I know that public aid is one of the most complicated issues and that for years it has been distorting the application of competition policy within the Union. Given the factors which the Commissioner has mentioned in relation to the issue raised by Mr Berenguer, I would like to know – if indeed it is the case that there has been an inappropriate application of public funds, in this case in the region of Valencia – what compensation mechanisms are in place to rebalance competitiveness between similar existing structures in other tourist areas.

My vote in favour of the Méndez de Vigo-Seguro report is based more on the proposal to overcome the limitations on the Union which still remain after the Treaty of Nice, rather than being in agreement with the Treaty itself. I agree with the critical view of the current Treaty, as there was a lack of ambition and political decisiveness needed to give it more political content and to improve the capacity for decision making and participation of the Community institutions, especially Parliament and the Commission, in order to overcome a method of operation that is becoming increasingly markedly intergovernmental. It is very bad that, even in the new areas on which it was agreed in Nice that decisions would be taken by qualified majority, the codecision procedure was not incorporated. Although I recognise that Nice made the positive contribution of enabling the enlargement process, I do not think that this is enough. In fact, the Member States recognised the limitations of Nice, convening a further IGC for themselves in order to revise the Treaty of Nice in 2004, with specific objectives that will have to be finally fixed in the meeting in Laeken, under the Belgian Presidency, at the end of this year. I agree with the priorities that the Belgian Presidency has announced for this and, in particular, with incorporating the constitutional regions into the debating process on the content of the next Treaty. Of course, I defend the Brussels Declaration signed on Monday of this week by seven constitutional regions, of which Catalonia is one, and we need to ensure that the European regions with legislative powers participate in a very prominent way not only in the preparatory debate, first in Laeken and then at the IGC in 2004, but also in the decision-making processes on the policies of the Union. For the party and coalition represented by Convergència i Unió
, this aspect is of fundamental importance in order to ensure that the citizens of the Union participate in it to a higher degree, and it is obvious that the constitutional regions are already an element of representation, responsibility and contribution on a European level that the Union cannot do without. I would like to reiterate my support for the proposal that the post-Nice debate should become a constitutional process, as this is the best option in order to clarify and fix the political content of the Union in the 21st Century.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as Mr von Wogau has pointed out in the presentation of his report – which has my Group’s full support – we are at an historic moment, with the culmination of the process of introducing the euro so close, but we are also, as has been said, at a delicate moment for the European economy. The forecasts, which were rosier some months ago, have had to be revised downwards. There is enormous resistance to setting the inflation rate at the target of 2% and there is clear concern about the current economic situation. This obviously leads to the question of what is the correct way to try to overcome this situation and ensure solid and sustained growth. In this respect, Mr von Wogau’s report contains many elements which should be taken into account, but I would like to highlight some of them which we have already stressed. There are some which we have in fact mentioned in various debates. The first is the need for Member States to remain rigorous and resolute with regard to the commitments established in the respective stability programmes: we are worried that there may be flexibility – in the field of deficit and public debt – with regard to those issues intended to ensure that objectives are achieved and complied with. We would also like to mention the need for better and greater coordination of economic policies – you know that we are not satisfied with the current level of coordination, and this Parliament has stressed this on many occasions – and we would like to stress the issue of structural reforms and the need for flexibility in certain markets which affect the productive structure of the European Union, such as the labour market, and, obviously, the process of liberalisation in certain sectors also considered to be key sectors.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate provides us with an opportunity to consider the present state of the European economy. Although this was generally encouraging in the year 2000, and we have enjoyed high growth rates, job creation and monetary stability, many hard questions have now to be asked concerning the development of these factors. Consequently, considerable pressure will be exerted in some countries, as is already the case in the European Union as a whole, to move towards more expansionist policies. Obviously, such a move could come into conflict with the commitments given within the stability pacts relating to Member States. For this reason, we consider that certain parts of the report we are debating today are particularly apposite. These are the sections highlighting the need to maintain budgetary discipline and to avoid undertaking to reduce taxes, a promise often given in the run-up to elections, unless corresponding balancing measures are adopted. We also endorse something Mr Katiforis is constantly stressing, namely that there should also be balancing measures for productive investments. Investments of this sort will improve the productive structure of the European Union and make us much more competitive. I would like to end by highlighting the need to maintain this coordination and the agreements established in the stability programmes. I also wish to point to the need to strengthen control of economic and monetary policy. We believe this is still unduly fragmented. Obviously, the capabilities and coherence of the management will be put to the test when it is presented with greater problems in the future.

 Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as my fellow Group member, Mr Haarder, announced in his intervention, I am going to focus on the specific aspects of the follow-up to the Lisbon European Council. In this respect our Group is critical, as it sees that the results are poor. In Lisbon what was agreed upon was a process of economic liberalisation, a process of structural reforms, the consolidation of the single European market and a move towards a single market for services, with the ambition of making the European economy the most competitive internationally by 2010, without, of course, giving up the social dimension or the levels of well-being that characterise the societies belonging to the Union. At this European Council, however, we have found that the individual interests of Member States have blocked necessary processes of liberalisation. Others, through internal disputes, as the Swedish Prime Minister has said in his capacity as President of the Council, have not been able to reach the necessary agreement for the single European sky, and so it has not been possible to turn what were good proposals at Lisbon into a reality. That is why our assessment is critical and we think the results are poor.

Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, ladies and gentlemen, in this proposal, which shares the concern expressed by the PPE-DE Group, our Group has expressed its unease at this distortion of competition, which arises in practice and which, as has been said, to an extent leaves those fields which certain Member States have opened up to competition and in which they have liberalised their companies unprotected. We are therefore in an unbalanced situation in which companies which still have the characteristics of public companies, and therefore have a monopoly in a Member State, take advantage of the openness of the external market and indulge in unfair competition in relation to companies which have entered into what we may call the free game of the market. As Mr Galeote has said, disputes have arisen, and are arising, in Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and the United Kingdom, and infringement procedures are under way in Denmark, Germany and Holland. This is therefore a widespread situation, which demonstrates that the principles guiding the 1997 Communication referred to earlier, are no longer valid. We therefore urge that the relevant legislation be updated, with the due participation of this Parliament, and that this should take place, on the one hand, to eliminate these positions of privilege and, on the other hand, to safeguard the actions of the Member States, which have behaved in accordance with the process of the opening up of markets, which are liberalising them and which need the relevant guarantees so that the companies which enter into this European internal market have all the safeguards resulting from being a part of it.

Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to announce our group’s support for the reports by Mr Katiforis and Mrs Kauppi, whose proposals are a significant step forward in the creation of a single market in financial services, in accordance with the Commission’s proposals contained in the action plan on financial services. The removal of obstacles in the Member States with regard to financial markets is essential in the Europe of the euro and will enable us to take advantage of all the opportunities offered by the existence of the single European currency. Allow me once again to repeat the comparison I have made before. What we are now undertaking in the financial and monetary field is what we undertook ten years ago with the establishment of the European single market for goods and services, ensuring the general freedom of movement for capital, workers and goods. We have set a timetable: 2005, and our fellow Members’ proposals, I believe, move in the right direction. They support the Commission’s proposals, they highlight the need to meet the timetable and, at the same time, they offer and indicate specific aspects. With regard to the report by Mrs Kauppi, I believe that paragraph 16, on the mechanisms which have been applied and proposed – and which the Commission has already implemented – to resolve cross-border extrajudicial disputes relating to financial services, is essential to overcoming possible problems at Member State level. This system and this concern also appear in Mr Katiforis’s report. I congratulate both of them on their work and I repeat that we support them.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although officially this debate came about as a result of the recent floods in various Member States of the European Union, it has quickly moved towards a debate on Parliament’s support for the Spanish Government’s plan to make a series of major changes to the water management system in Spain, which we know as the national water plan. As spokesperson for Convergencia Democrática de Cataluña
 in the European Parliament, I would like to express that my party, and also the Catalan Government, of which we are a part along with Unió Democràtica de Catalunya
, do not agree with the proposals from the Spanish laid down in the aforementioned plan. In the case that most directly affects Catalonia, we suggest an alternative based on transferring one fifth of the volume of water proposed by the Spanish (specifically from the river Ebro, which has been mentioned here) the use of desalination plants (which have also been suggested here as a valid alternative), better use of what is available in the current channels and finally, transfer from the Ródano. And this is where this plan enters into a European dimension. We have been saying for years that one of the most serious problems that the most-developed societies, such as European societies, have to solve, in the medium and long term, is the shortage of water caused by the development of our urban centres and the locations of our new economic activities, which requires a new type of water management. We cannot escape from this reality and we also need to consider it from a European perspective, because the situation demands it. We do not understand the resistance against limiting transfers between basins, while maintaining State borders. In the case of Spain, there is complete opposition from the Spanish to this possibility, but it is, however, accepted for Portugal. We therefore stress that water management needs to have a European perspective, that transfers from basins irrespective of the borders between the Member States need to be considered because, among other things, the aim of the European Union is a Europe without borders.

Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, representatives of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in making an assessment of the observable results during the first year of implementation of the Lisbon agreements, we reach very limited conclusions. Lisbon established a process to run throughout this decade aimed at turning the European economy into the most competitive, best trained, and most socially balanced economy in the world. However, we note that, at least at the end of this first year, which takes us from Lisbon to Stockholm, there are very few tangible results. We are not satisfied. We believe that, although the objectives were clearly established, we have neither made quick enough progress on the process of liberalisation, which should improve competition between markets, nor have we implemented the structural reforms necessary to better equip the infrastructures. Nor have we implemented the instruments necessary to become more competitive and to bring us into line, particularly with the United States, in terms of levels of training in areas in which we have the greatest advantage, that is to say technological development and scientific research. We believe that we have to proceed much more quickly in these areas and we wish to focus on three fundamental questions which I will try to summarise in my few remaining seconds. Firstly, structural reforms and liberalisation. Secondly, incorporation and interest on the part of the private sector in the fields of high quality education and training. Thirdly, a significant reform of the labour market which, on the one hand, will promote the incorporation of workers and the least-favoured groups into the labour market and, on the other, will provide greater and better mobility in employment within the European Union.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to congratulate Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Liberal Group and on my own behalf, and offer our support for his report on an issue which, although it is very important – the broad economic policy guidelines – is nevertheless a substitute for what we would like to see. We have always argued that, in the Europe of the euro, there should be a genuine and well-defined leadership for economic and monetary policy. It is well known that, at the moment, it is produced by means of negotiations between ECOFIN and the Commission, with the intervention of Parliament. The broad guidelines are clearly a fundamental element, but – I repeat – it is still in our view a substitute for what should be a genuine economic and monetary policy at European Union level with the opportunity to act in a more direct manner. Of the different aspects dealt with in Mr von Wogau’s report, I would like to highlight three, which, from our liberal perspective, are particularly important. The first is to push ahead with the process of liberalisation in sectors such as telecommunications, postal services, railways, etc., sectors which still hinder the possibility of achieving higher levels of competitiveness and a single market which functions better. This process would also, as Mr Bolkestein correctly pointed out, lead to better functioning of the single market and the disappearance of barriers within it. This better functioning – as Parliament approved in my report on structural reforms and liberalisation – would in particular guarantee a profound reform of the labour markets, an essential element, firstly, in better adapting to the economic and social needs of European society and, secondly, in achieving what we need, that is, higher levels of productivity in order to be competitive on an international level.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, last year’s Lisbon European Council established a process for the European Union to reach the same level of competitiveness as the United States, or at least for us to achieve this level by 2010. I believe that both Mr Bullmann’s report and my own make a positive and constructive contribution to our thinking on how to achieve this goal and our ability to take stock and analyse the situation after the past year, before the Stockholm European Council. The strategic goal of the European Union economy is to turn itself into the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. All these objectives are highly demanding. The European Union will not give up its level of social cohesion as an economy based on well-being, which is one of the great features of European society, achieved and consolidated during the second half of the last century. At the same time it is a clearly dynamic economy, as it has been demonstrating over these last years. But nobody can fail to see that having such strong social commitments, ensuring sustainable growth and also being the most competitive economy in the world are three highly demanding objectives, and to meet them we must therefore keep well on top of any possible obstacles to achieving this. In my view, something that may jeopardise the joint achievement of these three objectives is if the basic factors that ensure the competitiveness of the European economy are not implemented rigorously enough. I believe there are basically three of these factors. First of all, there are some markets that are still not open enough to competition, and given that they are basic to our production structure they have a negative effect on cost structures, including unit prices for goods and services. Mr Solbes has mentioned them: energy, transport and telecommunications. They are obviously fundamental factors, and if we compare them with the other leading world economy, the United States, we still have a gap to make up, clearly preventing us from approaching this desired level of competitiveness which we have set for 2010. In second place is a subject that concerns me greatly and is very well expressed both in the Bullmann report and my own: employment. It is obvious that we cannot give up the idea of raising employment levels, which is one of the major goals set by the Swedish Presidency. But it is also obvious that to achieve this level of employment – and as both reports point out, with a more highly qualified labour force – we have to find a greater willingness to adapt, both socially – there are countries within the European Union that have very interesting formulas in this respect – and, as the 1995 Delors report said, in the sphere of labour market flexibility. This is an essential factor in achieving two objectives, that is, a higher employment rate and greater competitiveness throughout the productive structure, where of course the labour dimension is fundamental. Lastly, education. I shall not labour this point, since the Bullmann report has mentioned it, as has Commissioner Solbes. This third essential element is that of quality education at all levels, from occupational training to specialist studies in higher education. This must lay the foundations – I am finishing here, Mr President – for us to get what we really need, something that Europe has not yet achieved in comparison with the United States. Although we have a very high level of scientific training and scientific innovation, we still have not closed the gap on the United States, nor have we overcome the existing difference to achieve a kind of technological development that can be turned into competitive goods and services. This is the third fundamental recommendation in this analysis and stock-taking of the Lisbon European Council.

 My vote in support of the de Veyrac report on the application of the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage in the Member States of the European Union is based on the conviction that we must enhance the cultural dimension of the European Union. We must work to ensure we have a cultural policy in the Union which highlights, among the main features of its spiritual richness and that of the Old World, its cultural, linguistic, architectural and artistic diversity and all those elements that make up our common cultural heritage. This is clear when you travel around the Union and see how the diverse spiritual trends over the centuries have been embodied in our monuments, artistic styles, value systems, religious and spiritual trends, and schools of philosophical and scientific thought. In short, and in accordance with the Treaties, we must go deeper with our European cultural policy, supporting and protecting our cultural diversity, a factor which in turn defines the European Union. The de Veyrac report is a laudable contribution towards this.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we would firstly like to congratulate our colleague Mr Brok on his initiative in promoting this debate before the meeting in Marseilles begins. As Commissioner Patten indicated, it is clear that the lack of consolidated peace in the Middle East is distorting the whole process that was outlined at the Euro-Mediterranean Conference and, in particular, the appropriate and correct application of the MEDA funds. The Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party obviously supports the Commission’s actions in favour of a Mediterranean policy, as outlined five years ago in Barcelona, and we want it to be consolidated. A few days ago, in Barcelona, at various meetings of the Círculo de Economía, the Secretary General of the Council, Mr Solana, told us that the priorities for European external activity are firstly with our neighbours, and our closest neighbours are the Mediterraneans. And we are not forgetting that the source of potential conflicts that we have in the medium term, due to demographic change, inequality of income, changing expectations and cultural differences, is also there. Our priority must therefore be to ensure the peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean and we have to make every possible effort to achieve this cooperation and to ensure that the funds allocated are used efficiently, according to what we might call the selfish generosity of the European Union. We have to be generous towards the Mediterranean, but from a selfish point of view, which is to safeguard the stability that we need so much for the people of the European Union, and for European society.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express the Liberal Group’s support for the report by Mrs Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines, which, as she herself mentioned in the introduction to her report, is not, and should not be, considered to be purely a formality, a summary of the application of the European Year of Learning in 1996, but rather as an analysis that serves to make a series of proposals on what the standing of education should be in its various fields, including the fields of lifelong learning and vocational and technical training, which deserve special attention. This coincides with the ideas expressed a few months ago at the Lisbon and Feira European Councils, when all the Member States pledged to develop a series of measures at European Union level so that, during this decade, the European Union can become a leading society at international level and achieve the levels of competence that North America has today, particularly in technological areas. To be precise, the key element in the process to achieve this level of competence lies in training, education and in a society with levels of excellence that lay the necessary foundations for progress to be made in the most technologically developed and advanced fields of scientific and technological innovation. The report by Mrs Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines, and she has also mentioned this today, shows the imbalances that still exist in the field of education between the level of the European Union and national level, that is, on the one hand we want action in education at European Union level, but on the other, the Member States do not want to give up their competences and establish true cooperation on an educational level. It is true that there are some programmes that we always use as references, such as Socrates or Leonardo, but in precisely these programmes, we must recognise the lack of sufficient resources to achieve the scope and effect that we would like. Finally, I therefore recommend that you pay particular attention to points 16, 17, 18, 19, 23 and 24, which constitute a good guide for the achievement of these higher levels of education at European Union level.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, and along with my colleague Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, we join others in offering our condolences to the victims of the Russian nuclear submarine, and in asking for greater cooperation between the European Union and the Russian authorities in order to prevent a further disaster. Obviously, we believe that the European Union has sufficient arguments to ensure such cooperation. We would also like to express our concern – as other speakers have done – because, unfortunately, the matter that we were to discuss, that of the very serious, terrible and fatal accident of the submarine Kursk has led us to deal with the problem of a nuclear submarine in Mediterranean waters, in European Union territory, in a British colony. This is causing very serious and justified alarm, due to a serious breakdown in the nuclear reactor, and because, among other things, European Union directives are not being complied with. We think that there is a need to take urgent action. The European Union must intervene, and this nuclear submarine needs to be urgently transported to a British base to be repaired under the proper conditions.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret having to speak once again to defend the cause of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi. This is not only the defence of a person who suffers for having fought for democracy and freedom, but also of what she represents in a whole population’s fight to achieve those things. Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi deserved the recognition of the international community by being awarded the Nobel Prize, the Sajarov Prize from this Parliament and the Prize for Freedom from Liberal International. Now she is being denied the most basic freedoms, along with those who follow her in the difficult process against dictatorship, to which Mr Dupuis has already referred. All these people are in an unacceptable situation. Therefore, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports the proposals of the corresponding resolution and, in particular, I would like to draw attention to paragraph 8, which asks that both the United States and the Commission and the Council impose the appropriate political and economic sanctions as long as there is no process of democratisation in Burma.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Medina Ortega said, we too must reiterate the unfortunate position of the conflict in Colombia, and highlight that in the Peace Community in La Unión, in the region of Urabá, there have been three murders since 1997. Fortunately, the Colombian Government has decided to pursue those responsible and punish them accordingly. But the fact is that, since 1997, there have been three murders, the most recent on 8 July of this year, and the Peace Community of La Unión and the Intercongregational Committee for Justice and Peace, including the Irish Franciscan priest Brendan Forde, have had repeated death threats, despite their position of remaining neutral and contributing to bringing peace to the area. We think that this situation again requires the strongest possible action on the part of the European institutions. Both the Commission and the European Parliament have a series of opportunities for this in cooperation with the United Nations Human Rights Office and also through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia. We urge the Commission, obviously in cooperation with Parliament, to provide the Colombian Government with all our political force and capacity for pressure so that finally the desired peace can come to Colombia and these tragic situations of assassinations, deaths and murders do not happen again.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Clegg has already expressed his broad support, on behalf of the Liberal Group, for the Commission’s proposals, and his concern about certain specific aspects relating to the United States, as has just been mentioned. I would like to highlight the concern about an aspect which appears in the Liberal Group’s original motion for a resolution, whose first section refers to the need to reject any political interference in the Commission’s competition policy. If we apply this to the issue in question, the telecommunications sector, it is a well-founded concern given the cases which arose in Spain, a few months ago, involving the merger of Telefónica with a Dutch company, in Portugal and in other sectors in France. It worries us that there is still government interference in the actions of companies who are seeking appropriate dimensions and competitiveness at a European level. We therefore support the Commission’s proposals and we would like to draw attention to this aspect.

Mr President, I am pleased to announce that the Liberal Group’s vote is favourable to the reports by Mr Valdivielso and Mr Piétrasanta. However, I must admit that there are certain reservations in our group with regard to future budgetary proposals as a result of the difficulties which have arisen up until now in the employment of funds intended for the MEDA programme. However, this issue would lead us into a discussion of the budget, which is not the main subject of this debate. The main subject of this debate is political and the issue is the fact the Mediterranean is one of the essential elements in ensuring the peace, stability and progress of the European Union itself. Eliminating tension and promoting balanced development in the Mediterranean third countries leads to greater security, prosperity and prospects for the European Union. Therefore, Mediterranean policy must be a fundamental pillar of the Union’s external action, which will benefit the European Union itself. Furthermore, I believe that we must consider that officially, there are at least three Mediterranean candidate countries, and that, with regard to the conflicts which Mr Valdivielso has mentioned, the European Union has made a very significant contribution in recent years to solving them. We are very close to reaching peace agreements to solve them definitively and this obviously requires a significant economic contribution for which MEDA is the main financial instrument. The different aspects mentioned in each report must be taken into account because they make a wonderful contribution to achieving this.

Mr President, I would first like to join in congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on his work. I am pleased with this initiative from the Danish Government, which is based on the new procedure established in the Treaty of Amsterdam, in order to deal with the matter of ensuring better and greater protection for the environment in the European Union, something which should obviously not be limited by borders within the Union. My colleague, Mrs Thors, has already expressed our favourable position with regard both to the report and to the amendments tabled by the respective committees, and I will therefore focus on three points. For some time, I have been trying to ensure that the Commission deals appropriately with European forests, and I have seen the problems that have arisen as a result of the need to deal in a variety of ways with this issue which has a clear environmental dimension. The first difficulty that I see in truly applying this proposal is in categorising environmental crimes, given the diversity within the Union. The second matter is the need to consider the international dimension of the crime. We have seen how difficult it is to find out who is ultimately responsible for many large-scale environmental crimes, but, furthermore, the set of legal responsibilities of the entities who, ultimately, appear to be responsible, really makes it very difficult to actually deal with these crimes from a criminal point of view. I think that this will be an important task for the Commission. We have to prevent criminal responsibilities from being blurred. Thirdly, Mr President, I just want to say that it is essential that the field of justice and home affairs be communitised in the European Union, and this proposal demonstrates that.

Firstly, I would like to say that our Group, as it did in committee, supports the Karas report. We believe that it is a very good report and it makes a very positive contribution to an issue of fundamental importance in the process of introducing the euro into the lives of our citizens. It is clear that the euro is not purely a macroeconomic and financial issue. It is an issue which will reach every European citizen, it is a European distinguishing mark and, therefore, it is of the greatest importance in the process of European construction. To this end, it is very important that a campaign be implemented – and a very good campaign – so that in 2002 the euro may enjoy the degree of confidence and acceptance which we all want. Furthermore, as has been said, there is a great delay in terms of the number of countries and companies prepared for its use and in terms of our citizens’ level of knowledge. In this respect I would like very briefly to highlight three dimensions. The first is decentralisation. The participation of regional and local authorities is very important. Many of them have very significant responsibilities and are better prepared than the Member States themselves to reach the citizen. This is an aspect that the European Central Bank and the Commission should bear in mind. I would like to know Commissioner Solbes’ opinion with regard to participation at this level, which Mr von Wogau has also requested. We must ensure that these administrations play a significant role. It falls to them to do so, since they are best prepared to reach the citizens. Secondly, this decentralisation must also take place at company and industry level and not be limited to the headquarters of managerial or union organisations. Thirdly, I recommend that you read the conclusions of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which introduce a cultural dimension, which is very important to the success of this information campaign.

Mr President, we are currently discussing an issue which Parliament has dealt with on previous occasions. It is the case of Equatorial Guinea, one of so many African countries which have undergone a very poor transition from the colonial era, during which former colonial relationships, on the one hand, and the ambitions of other Member States of the Union to extend their area of influence, on the other, have prevented the support necessary and conducive to the establishment of a genuine democratic system. In 1999 there were general elections to the Guinean Parliament, during which the international observers noted that human rights, democratic guarantees and freedom of information had been violated. The same situation may now reoccur during the elections on 28 May, which is why, as this resolution states, we demand the appropriate intervention of the European Union, in order to guarantee that democratic elections take place on this occasion.

Mr President, the Liberal Group will support the Katiforis report on the broad guidelines for economic policies, which we are especially satisfied with since many of our observations were accepted during the debate in committee. At a time when we are debating the weakness of the euro, at least in relation to the dollar, I think that we would do well to remember that the state of the European economy is solid and offers a framework for stability and solidity as well as excellent prospects for growth and employment. In short, we can look forward to very positive development over the next few years. Therefore, the fact that, in some ways, the US economy is doing better than the European economy, at least in terms of growth forecasts, should not mask the fact that the European economy is doing well at the moment. Furthermore, it is the European economy which is funding a good portion of US development. However, we should not only be concentrating on the more positive aspects; we should also be taking note of the fragility of continued growth and solidity in the European economy. In order to overcome this fragility, in our view, we need the European economy to function better, since it is still subject to excessive corporate rigidity, in both the public and private sectors, and on the part of both economic and social operators. We therefore propose greater adaptability and flexibility in the labour market. This would clearly involve the removal of the existing obstacles to the proper functioning of the European internal market and a deep reform of the tax system, with the adoption of a tax package at European level. To sum up, we should overcome the conservatism which still exists in certain economic and social areas of the European Union.

Mr President, the Liberal Group supports the rigorous and demanding report by Mr Pomés Ruiz. It lays out and highlights both the achievements and the shortcomings of the Member States in the way the stability and convergence programmes are applied, which, as I mentioned in my previous intervention on the Katiforis report, have brought satisfactory results for the whole of the European economy. However, this current satisfactory situation must not mask a series of shortcomings and must lead to the implementation of the series of recommendations which the rapporteur, Mr Pomés Ruiz, correctly makes in his report. He mentioned one of these recommendations in his speech: the need to take advantage of the current favourable situation, the healthy state of public finances – which on the other hand are disciplined by the stability and convergence programmes – in order to reduce the deficit, and possibly remove it completely, as well as to reduce debt levels, even to below the limits set in the convergence programmes. This would mean that we could make far-reaching tax reforms which would contribute to a more favourable environment for our economy, for business initiative, to freeing up resources and promoting them by fiscal means in an area which is one of our priority commitments: to be up-to-date and competitive at the most advanced levels of the information society and in the application of new technologies. I would like to conclude by arguing – and I believe this is one of the conclusions we must draw from Mr Pomés Ruiz’s report – for greater coordination between the Member States with regard to the implementation of these programmes. I would therefore like to insist once again on the need for a genuine direction for economic and monetary policy at European Union level.

Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to thank you for your interest and dedication to the European Union’s information activities. We have known you for many years and we know of your commitment and dedication, not only to what we could call the European cause, but also to ensuring that the European cause really reaches the citizens. In your political activities you have always paid special attention to the most sensitive groups: young people, elderly people, the workplace, and you paid special attention to the media. We support the general lines which you have put forward here and which will be specified in the document which you will present and which the European Commission must approve next June. You have mentioned two aspects which I would like to stress: the regional dimension and efficiency. The aim of the information policy is to reach the citizens. In order to do that properly it is necessary to take account of the regional dimension, because it is one of the fields which is a subject of great sensitivity in terms of society and its problems. Therefore, so that the citizens may understand and participate in European construction and not see it as a superstructure reserved for politicians and technocrats, it is essential that the work of providing information is done at the level of the regional institutions and in conjunction with them. This goes hand in hand with efficiency. In your review of information policy, I would ask you to bear in mind the experience of certain Member States. For example, during the euro campaign, there was an agreement at the time between the European Commission and the government of a Member State. That government’s decision was to commission an information campaign on the euro from a very important advertising agency. That advertising agency made some very nice advertisements and hundreds of thousands of leaflets were distributed. However, that it is not the way to reach the public, nor is it efficient. It is perhaps very pleasing to the government, which gets to make fine speeches, and to the relevant Minister, who gets to appear on the television and in the newspapers, but that does not reach the public. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the maximum possible degree of decentralisation.

Mr President, the Council and the Commission should take good note of Parliament’s practically unanimous position in favour of the relaunch of the Union’s Mediterranean policy, as was established at the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Barcelona in 1995, under the Spanish presidency, and whose characteristics have already been highlighted here. On the other hand, we know that certain obstacles, basically political ones, have hindered its correct application. I would simply like to remind you that, within a few years, the population in the south of the Mediterranean will be greater than that of the north, but that practically all the wealth will be in the north rather than the south. If the European Union does not act quickly to redress the balance of this situation, both from a demographic point of view and from a social, economic and political point of view, we will be creating an explosive situation for future generations to deal with. It is therefore a political priority to show political leadership, obviously accompanied by economic cooperation in order to improve the expectations of these populations and bring prosperity and stability to the whole of the Mediterranean, because the prosperity and stability of the European Union also depends on this.

 Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must indicate my complete and categorical condemnation of the terrorist attack on 22 February in Vitoria which took the lives of the socialist MP and spokesman in the Basque parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez. In a country governed by the rule of law and which is a member of the European Union, it should be possible for all ideas and options to be defended, provided that this occurs democratically and with respect for the rights of the individual and the principles and values of justice, freedom and economic and social progress on which the Union is based. The transgression of these principles is simply not acceptable, as clearly indicated in the Treaties. There is no justification in our society for terrorist acts such as the one which took the lives of Fernando Buesa and Jorge Díez, particularly when the former was a freely elected representative of the Basque people. We pray that these are the last victims in a process which, as you said, Madam President, has seen much barbarism. We pray that a way forward can be found which will allow the Basque people to live together in peace. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr Katiforis’ passion and conviction have prevented him from carrying out the usual task of a rapporteur in plenary which is to defend his report. Instead he has defended his own position which was not the one approved in committee. We clearly have different views, one of which is that we believe the development of the European economy can be regarded with confidence. Yesterday, when speaking to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Commissioner Solbes specifically indicated that the prospects for this year and next for the European economy are excellent. Moreover, several countries were mentioned whose problem is what to do with the public surplus. They are having to choose, for example, between reducing taxes or reducing the public deficit, but clearly avoiding any price rises, or – so there is no misunderstanding – creating a special reserve for future situations in which welfare may be needed, given the EU’s population growth. We are inclined to believe that a solid basis exists for this economic growth in the Union, now and in the coming years. It must be taken into account that we have an open, globalised and very competitive economy. In order to reach and even overtake the leading position of the United States of America, we must avoid interventionism, as proposed initially by Mr Katiforis, and also excessive intervention by the public authorities in the construction of certain infrastructures. Furthermore, the Member States refused to contribute more funds when we discussed Agenda 2000 which means that there will be little available over the next few years at Union level. However, we must stress the need to continue developing the construction of the European internal market which still has some serious flaws. There are still sectors such as air transport, energy and telecommunications in which, if we compare our unit cost with that of the USA or other countries which are equally competitive at international level, the cost supported by our companies is very high. This report contains information which shows that in order to create a new company the bureaucratic cost in the USA is EUR 500 and in the European Union, on average, it is EUR 1 600. We therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention. It is only by complying with the essential agreements established with the programmes following on from the stability pact and by developing a market with less obstacles at all levels that we will reach the levels of competitiveness required by the European Union.

Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must express my surprise at this debate on the international movement of capital and its possible taxation which, although it does not mention it in the text, appears to be an attempt to revive, as the introduction has done, the issue of the tax proposed some years ago by Mr Tobin, which our Group opposed, clearly and totally, during the last legislature, with a series of arguments clearly and coherently expressed by our President, Mr Cox. I will have to repeat these arguments, modestly, in this intervention, because the same issue has arisen once again. We do not agree with this type of tax because its application, in the event that it could happen, would not achieve the aims which Mr Tobin presented at the time and which the Left in this House wishes to revive. Firstly, there is no evidence that the tax on international capital movements could reduce the dangers of volatility and instability in the international markets. On the contrary, since it is certain that not all countries would accept it, we would open the way to speculation and fraud and that really would create volatility, instability, insecurity, opacity and unfair competition in the field of financial services operating on an international level. Furthermore, the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically needy countries presents such complexity, when we consider their application in practice, that it appears simply impossible. This is a false debate whose aim is purely political, and has no basis or technical viability. Furthermore – since we are in this European Parliament – if we have still not managed the slightest agreement with regard to the package of fiscal measures proposed by the Commission within the European Union, how can we expect to achieve a fiscal agreement on an international level? I suppose that the first thing they say will be, ‘let us see whether you are capable of reaching a fiscal agreement within the Union’. However, the Liberal Group has not wanted to close the door to a new analysis of this issue and, therefore, we have accepted a joint motion for a resolution proposing that a study be carried out on the possibility and suitability of imposing this tax on certain areas of international capital movements. I am sure that this study – if carried out objectively, with knowledge of the financial markets and their mechanisms on an international level – will show that it is neither suitable nor possible, not only in terms of its application, but also as a means of achieving the proposed objectives. In itself, globalisation is positive. The economy has never grown so much nor favoured so many countries on a global level. This is due to progressive opening up and greater freedom in the international trade in goods and services and also a greater capacity for adequate movement of capital. Any analysis of economic development in recent years, if objective, will show, through the figures, that they have no political colour or orientation. As I have said, we are not opposed to such a study. We will support the motion for a resolution in support of this study, but we simply insist that, as this motion for a resolution points out, it is by means of liberalisation and opening up at an international level that we will achieve economic progress, both on the level of states and on a general level.

Mr President, amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate, I would like to comment on the one mentioned by Mr Berenguer, that is to say, the modernisation of competition policy, which is the subject of the Commission’s White Paper. Frankly, I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory. Through his management, Commissioner Monti achieves good results, as did his predecessor and, clearly, he has established a guarantee which, in parallel with the creation and development of the European internal market, has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the market economy within the Union may work adequately, without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market is enlarged, as has happened in the European Union since 1993. If it functions well, if we are satisfied, if the Commission has basically acted correctly, why the need for the modification? Various arguments have been presented in its favour. Mr Berenguer made a very accurate analysis, justifying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition, but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the Member States, are truly identical in all regions. Because, if this is not the case, we will be faced with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market. In that event we would not have moved forward, but rather backwards, in the application of competition policy in the Union.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, on behalf of the Liberal Group we support this initiative which we consider to be very appropriate in terms of ensuring the necessary consensus in the economic and social field as well as absolutely essential in order to achieve a climate of stability, growth and greater employment in the European Union. While accepting this approach, I would like to make two observations. The first takes up the observations of the Socialist representative with regard to the good sense in taking account of fundamental aspects, of structural reforms, which were already contained in the White Paper on Competitiveness and Employment. The report of the European Central Bank explains that there are certain problems in achieving greater levels of growth – or greater stability in the European Union or greater competitiveness in a process of open economy, needs which are even more accentuated bearing in mind the coming Millennium Round – specifically because certain structural aspects still need to be dealt with in more depth: from the labour markets to, as has been said, the training system, or other equally important aspects such as, for example, an improvement in the levels of research and development. On the other hand, I would like to refer to the participants who must be taken into account in the macroeconomic dialogue and I would dare to suggest that three more should be added: the representatives of two institutions of the European Union itself, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions – two institutions which represent an extremely important economic and social dimension and, in the case of the regions, clearly, some of them have an absolutely essential role in guaranteeing these objectives – and finally the organisations of small and medium-sized enterprises. All of us say that the SMEs play a very important and decisive role in ensuring greater growth and yet, I have not seen them incorporated into this macroeconomic dialogue. Having made these observations, I would like to reiterate our support for this initiative.

Mr President, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I am pleased to express our support and favourable position with regard to the report presented by Mr Huhne, concerning the 1998 annual report of the European Central Bank. First of all, we must congratulate ourselves on the process of introducing the euro. It is now a complete reality which is operating with total normality on all the economic levels envisaged – in the Member States, in the European Union, on an international level. The good leadership and management of the European Central Bank has undoubtedly contributed to this normality and we should congratulate it and its President since, during the early months of the establishment of the euro, when the initial approaches were adopted, they had to overcome – and they did it skilfully – certain adverse circumstances at moments which were clearly delicate at an internal as well as an international level. At that time – and I must insist on this – the European Central Bank displayed skill, good leadership and management and the ability to maintain the principles of independence. This very solidity, which has been demonstrated in so few months, should allow us to be braver, more decisive in some areas which have already been mentioned, which are in Mr Huhne’s report and which I would like to insist on. One of them is clearly the issue of transparency in some areas that the President of the Central Bank himself has already mentioned. The publication of the forecasts, the possibility of having access to the minutes of meetings and a global report on the economic progress of the Member States are elements which will contribute – as the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, by means of the intervention of its President, Mrs Randzio-Plath, has demonstrated, and as mentioned in Mr Huhne’s report – to the consolidation of the level of internal and international acceptance and, of course, transparency, not only with regard to public opinion but also with regard to the experts in monetary affairs. Let me end by insisting on the specific position of the Liberal Group which calls for, after the transitional period of two years, the publication of votes, the various positions taken in the meetings of the Executive Board and the macroeconomic models, which I believe would allow more convincing and accurate forecasts to be made by those whose operations relate to the European Central Bank.

Mr President, it appears that today, at the request of the Cuban Government, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights is going to vote for a draft resolution on the situation of the prisoners in Guantánamo. I would ask the following question: with what authority can the Castro Government demand explanations of the situation of these prisoners and demand measures to guarantee that their rights are respected, when Cuba still has 74 citizens imprisoned in inhuman conditions, hundreds of kilometres from their homes, for the sole crime of wishing to exercise their inalienable right to freedom of expression and thought? We also roundly condemn what is happening in Guantánamo. However, precisely because we are demonstrating the consistency that the Castro Government so cynically demands from the European Union in Geneva – a consistency that Fidel Castro himself is incapable of showing – we also once again condemn the arbitrary detention of the Cuban dissidents. It is true that Julio Antonio Valdés has been freed, and we are delighted about that. But what we do not want is to allow ourselves to be deceived and forget that the other dissidents are still in prison and that this imprisonment and the conditions involved, which contravene all international conventions in the field, are a flagrant violation of fundamental rights. Neither do we wish to forget that the Varela Project has not yet gone ahead and that Osvaldo Payá, whom Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize, is still unable to leave Cuba. Hence the timeliness of the Resolution we are discussing, which is perhaps a repetition, according to the Socialist Group – and this is the reason why it has not wished to sign up to this resolution – but nevertheless necessary, because events in Cuba are, regrettably, repeating themselves and the situation not only remains unchanged, but as the months have passed has actually deteriorated. We do not want either Parliament or the Commission to abandon people who fight peacefully to defend freedom to their fate, and nor do we want to remain silent about their suffering or about that of their families. We want to tell them from this House once again that we are still standing by them and that, despite the isolation in which they have been confined, we are not forgetting them and we are still with them in their fight, in the hope that one day Cuba can begin to move toward democracy.

Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank the Commission for the communication on the future of the textile and clothing industry, which has been published at a time when the sector is very worried about the final elimination of the import quota system on 1 January 2005 in view of the competitive pressure from developing countries – countries which also have a large export capacity – which could lead to the closure of many companies and consequently to job losses. China is a particular worry, since in addition to its competitiveness – the result of low business costs – it has a very aggressive trade policy, and shows little respect for the rules governing international trade. Recent studies indicate job losses in the European Union in the order of 40-60% by 2010 depending on the sector. If we add to this the fact that the European textile and clothing industry is concentrated in certain regions, with a predominantly female labour force, you will realise the gravity of the situation, and the urgent need for decisive action on the part of public administrations at all levels if the sector is to be successful in meeting the challenges it now faces. Obviously, the primary responsibility lies with the business directors who are responsible for defining strategies and making the investments needed in these new circumstances, but it is equally true that public authorities have an obligation to ensure that operating conditions are conducive to development. Clearly the industry’s future will include a reassessment of the sector’s comparative advantages: the quality of goods, design, the fashion factor, and, above all, the sector’s capacity for innovation and for developing new hi-tech products, especially intelligent fabrics and industrial fabrics. There will also be a phase of considering the opportunities for moving into the international market. This is why the measures proposed in the Commission’s communication are so welcome, because they address this very issue. For this reason, I am also very pleased that Commissioner Busquin is with us today, given the importance of research and development if the sector is to emerge victorious in the future. The problem is when and how to implement the measures detailed in the communication. It is all very well to analyse the sector’s problems and to determine how best to resolve them, but funding also needs to be set aside for the measures, which include creating a specific regional assistance programme for the sector which does not qualify as state aid and for providing training for workers to help them adapt to the changing labour market. This also needs to be combined with an action plan and with the adoption of a firm timetable so that activities can get under way before the end of 2004 and above all, before it is too late. We also need a firm commitment from the Commission that it will not reduce the trade policy measures it is proposing to put a stop to unfair competition, and to high duties, peak tariffs and non-tariff barriers which make market access so difficult. Commissioner, the future of the sector and the continued existence of thousands of jobs are in your hands.

Mr President, respecting, promoting and safeguarding human rights is one of the cornerstones of European integration. The Union therefore has the moral obligation and responsibility to defend and promote fundamental rights and freedoms. Consequently, we have the obligation and responsibility to improve the operation of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and to make it the world’s political conscience, and I am pleased with what has been said here in this regard. It also has the obligation and responsibility, however, to condemn with great clarity and courage the violations of these rights which are taking place, wherever they happen and regardless of the economic or foreign interests existing between the European Union and the countries where these violations take place or the motivations leading to the violation or jeopardising of fundamental freedoms and the principles of the Rule of Law. Not to do so means covering them up, becoming accomplices in them, accomplices in what is happening in Chechnya, in Guantanamo, in Cuba, in Tibet or in Iran. In this way, the Union would also be clearly contradicting the principles and values on which it is based and would lose all credibility, and without credibility it will not have the authority necessary to promote and demand from others respect for the principles we claim to defend. It is not sufficient, however, to condemn. We must also implement the recommendations of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and ensure that others implement them. Otherwise, our commitment will be purely rhetorical, and through rhetoric alone, however long the list of declarations adopted may be, it will be difficult for us to make a more humane world a reality for everyone. This morning, the Irish Prime Minister, on presenting the programme of the Irish Presidency of the Council, made a particular reference to the issue of human rights. The Geneva session offers an excellent opportunity to demonstrate that the words spoken this morning, which we have all applauded, truly respond to the will to ensure that the Union actively fulfils its commitment to the world to defend the fundamental freedoms which form the basis of the Community edifice. I am convinced, having heard what you have said, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that that will be the case.

Mr President, Commissioners, Mr Lamy said this morning that, in order for the world to be a better place, we need Doha. I completely agree with this statement and therefore, just as I regretted the failure of Cancún at the time, today I must regret the lack of progress at the Geneva meeting in December, while acknowledging that the simple fact of having resumed talks is positive, although, as the President of the General Council has recognised, those talks have only served to provide a clearer view of the key issues and to make us aware of the difficulties we are going to face, as well as reaffirming, on the part of the members of the WTO, the commitment to the Doha programme and, above all, the multilateral trade system, which, in itself, is of sufficient importance. The time has now come to show flexibility in our positions, so that we can move on from words to actions and furthermore do it at the pace that the calendar set at Doha requires. I therefore believe that we should thank Commissioners Lamy and Fischler for their efforts to open up channels for dialogue with everybody and between everybody, as well as the work done with the clear objective of moving the Doha agenda forward without losing sight of the European Union's legitimate interests. To this end, I completely agree with the analysis and the proposals contained in the Commission communication, particularly with regard to industrial tariffs and the need to achieve certain levels of commitment, particularly on the part of the emerging countries, which are much higher than those proposed in the Debray document and, in any event, equivalent to those of the European Union. With regard more specifically to tariffs for textile products, the Commission's document talks about negotiating new reductions which are as close as possible to zero, a proposal I totally agree with, provided that this does not mean - and I hope the Commissioner will clarify this – that the European Union will be obliged to reduce its tariffs, while others have not achieved an equivalent level for theirs. I would like to put a final question, Mr President. This morning, Mr Lamy also referred to the European Union becoming more flexible in environmental terms. I would like to ask him how far he intends that flexibility to go, because there is no doubt that the high costs in the environmental field are one of the causes of the relocation of many Community companies, but there is only one planet Earth, and the legislation demanded in order to achieve environmental development at planetary level must also be planetary.

Mr President, I was against the compromise reached by Parliament on this issue at the time, and I am against the Commission's proposal today as well and, consequently, the Liese report. And there are procedural reasons for this, because I believe, in agreement with the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, that within the framework of the internal market and since there is freedom of establishment, Community funds cannot be used to finance research which is not permitted in some Member States. Above all, however, I am against this for reasons of principle, because I am against any research which involves destroying a life, however incipient it may be and however noble the intended aims of this research are. All lives, regardless of their stage of development, have the same value and we cannot save some lives at the expense of others because, although the life being destroyed is embryonic, it is a life just the same. I agree that research has to be promoted, in particular if the aim is the well-being of patients suffering from serious diseases, and I am in favour of freedom of research but we must always fully respect human life and the dignity it deserves. The possibilities opened up by research with adult stem cells are very hopeful and much closer. Very positive results have already been achieved. Let us therefore focus the programmes’ funds on this type of research, which, furthermore, does not pose any ethical problem. Because, however many time limits we set, however many ethical principles we establish to justify this research, the destruction of an embryonic life represents a clear violation of the most fundamental of these principles, these principles which we say we defend and which we do defend: respect for human life and the dignity it deserves.

Mr President, I regret that two amendments, which were very important in terms of sending a political message firstly to the textiles sector, which is very concerned about the challenges it has to face in 2005, and secondly, to industry in general, which also has great concerns in view of the entry of China into the WTO, have not been able to be adopted as a result of the lack of a qualified majority. They could have served, as I have said, as a political message to the sectors, which are very worried. I believe that all those who have voted against them have shown a lack of coherence. At the same time, I would also like to explain that I have voted in favour of an increase in the budget in relation to the reconstruction of Iraq, although I was at the time and continue to be totally against the war, because I believe that we cannot continue to punish the Iraqi people, particularly in view of the serious insufficiencies in basic services for the population which already existed.

Mr President—in-Office of the Council, I do believe that it is essential that the Italian Presidency, on behalf of the European Union and its Member States of course, presents a motion for a resolution to the United Nations General Assembly calling for the adoption of a universal moratorium on death penalties. What is more, I also believe we have the obligation to present such a motion. Prudence cannot be allowed to make us forget our commitment to defend the right to life or our responsibility to work to increase international cooperation with a view to achieving the complete abolition of the death penalty in the world, because the death penalty is a violation of the fundamental right to life, and what is worse – as Amnesty International says – is that this violation is not only not hidden or denied, but is actually enshrined in the laws of the country which applies it. Furthermore, if a country does not respect the most fundamental of rights, with what authority will it demand from citizens respect for other rights and on what foundations will that country base its democracy and Rule of Law if its law allows the most important and most fundamental of rights to be violated: the right to life? For the European Union, therefore, the fight to abolish the death penalty and the fight for democracy and respect for human rights are and must be one and the same. It is true that progress has been made in this regard and that today far fewer countries maintain the death penalty in their legislation, but we are still far from its total abolition, as the statistics so cruelly demonstrate. The European Union, therefore, in order to be coherent in terms of the values on which it is founded, must make fighting the death penalty a priority, not only before the United Nations General Assembly, but also in its relations with third countries which have yet to abolish it, whatever links the Union may have with these countries or their strategic or commercial importance, because nobody must be given the power to decide on the life or death of a human being.

Mr President, Commissioner, implementing the Lisbon strategy with a view to improving the competitiveness of our companies is a key element in terms of relaunching the economy and preserving the European social model. Achieving this objective requires the existence of a broad and dynamic company fabric essentially composed of small and medium-sized enterprises, since these are best suited to the challenges of an environment which is constantly mutating and thereby responding to the concerns of the citizens in relation to employment. In order to guarantee the maintenance of this fabric, it is not sufficient, however, to guarantee the smooth operation, for example, of the internal market, or to implement a commercial policy which ensures the opening up of third country markets in a reciprocal fashion, or to implement an industrial policy which takes account of the specific needs of the different sectors, however important all this may be. In this regard, Commissioner, please allow me to express my satisfaction at your announcement of a forthcoming communication on the textile and clothing sector. As well as all these aspects I have referred to, we must also encourage the entrepreneurial spirit and promote the creation of companies and a favourable climate which allows them to develop and grow; without companies there can be no entrepreneurial fabric. Hence the timeliness of the Commission's Green Paper and the Langen report, which is the subject of this debate, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent work. We must reaffirm the importance and value of small and medium-sized businesses as a basic pillar of the European economy and promote the establishment of an environment which guarantees the appropriate training of entrepreneurs, stimulates the creation of companies, promotes their growth, their competitiveness and eliminates the legislative, administrative and fiscal obstacles which hinder entrepreneurial activity in line with the very appropriate proposals in the Langen report. Otherwise, the Lisbon objectives, which – let us not forget – should lead to the creation, between now and 2010, of 15 million jobs and greater social cohesion, will be reduced to mere wishes that are impossible to achieve.

 I support the draft European Constitution because, for all its faults, it is a useful instrument for enhancing effectiveness and democracy in the EU. Absent from the text, however, are certain measures which are fundamental to unifying the peoples of Europe. Those peoples are the foundations of the Community edifice. Amongst other things, this text does not recognise the specific needs of regions with legislative competence, or the right of those regions to participate in the decision-making process on issues which concern them. Neither does it allow them to bring proceedings before the Court of Justice, nor does it lay down a language system which includes all the official languages of each Member State. The Gil-Robles–Tsatsos report, however, makes no mention of any of the above questions. In doing so, it not only fails to send a message to the Intergovernmental Conference, but also demonstrates a complete lack of awareness of the aspirations of peoples such as the Catalans, who feel like part of Europe, who are Europe, and who demand the right to participate legitimately and democratically in the process of European integration. Although I would have preferred to vote against, therefore, I abstained from the vote, so that no one would think I opposed the draft Constitution.

 Madam President, Commissioner, we have indeed all lost out as a result of the failure at Cancún. Paradoxically, the least-developed countries are set to suffer most, when they should have been the main beneficiaries of the Development Round. Economic growth at global level has also been negatively affected. This is not only because a reduction of duties and the elimination of other barriers to trade benefits economic growth by making trade exchanges easier. It is also because success at Cancún would have sent out a very positive signal, one that would have helped revitalise the global economy. There is also likely to be a negative impact on the multilateral trading system. I am convinced there is no need to deviate from the course followed to date. Nonetheless, it is imperative to overcome the stalemate the Development Round finds itself in following Cancún. Work on the basis of the agreements previously reached must resume at the earliest opportunity. As has already been stated, it is essential to undertake an in-depth study of the working procedures of the WTO and its organisational structure. The reasons for the failure at Cancún must be investigated too. Commissioner, I venture to suggest a further area for consideration by you, namely the need to reformulate the development of the potential of the least-developed countries. By this I mean more than the need to increase the budget allocation for the purpose, though that is certainly required also. What I have in mind is the need to establish how best to help weaker countries to improve their negotiating capacity, and how best to empower them to take decisions for themselves, and to do so in full awareness of the facts. This would also ensure they were not taken advantage of. Regrettably, this does seem to have been the case in the past. Madam President, I believe the outcome of this consideration and the ensuing decisions will determine whether Doha will indeed prove a turning point, even though the next stage of the journey will be longer than anticipated. It will also determine the future of the multilateral trading system.

Mr President, Mr President–in–Office of the Council, Commissioner, half a year after the operation carried out by the Castro Government against internal dissidents – the most significant since the triumph of the Castro revolution – more than 70 internal dissidents – including promoters of the Varela Project, trade unionists and independent journalists – imprisoned for the sole crime of dissenting from official policy and freely expressing their opinion, remain in prison in conditions which, furthermore, clearly violate the most fundamental principles of humanitarian law and which genuinely threaten the lives of some of them. I am thinking in particular of Oscar Espinosa Chepe who is today hospitalised in the prison ward of the Finlay Military Hospital in Havana, seriously ill as the result of chronic cirrhosis of the liver – from which he suffered at the time of his arrest – and which has been aggravated by his weakness and the bad prison conditions and hygiene to which he has been subjected. In view of this situation and in view of the facts it is essential that we reiterate our unanimous condemnation of the Castro regime and demand the immediate release of all political prisoners, and it is also essential that we express our solidarity with the Cuban people, who most directly suffer the consequences of the lack of freedoms and demonstrate to them through action – rather than words – that we wish to help them to take the road of peaceful transition towards democracy they have set out upon. As the Uruguayan poet Eduardo Galeano said, Cuba hurts. It does indeed hurt to see political, economic and social freedoms continuing to be violated. And because we in this Parliament are hurt by it – and today we are receiving representatives of those countries which had been deprived of freedom under the Soviet totalitarian regime – we wish to tell them that they should not lose hope. We wish to tell them that no dictator can suffocate the right to rights in relation to aspirations for freedom and democracy.

Mr President, Commissioner, once again, unfortunately, forest fires have desolated the forests of the Mediterranean, and they have been particularly devastating this summer as a result of the climatic conditions we have suffered. As well as the loss of human lives, which we have to mourn, as well as the Dante-esque images left behind by the fires and the economic losses they have caused, the magnitude of the disaster which year after year hangs over the forests of the south of Europe and the consequences it has for the European Union as a whole demonstrate the need for a Community policy for protecting the forests against fires, with its own funding, which takes account of the specific nature of Mediterranean forests and which provides for prevention measures as an integral element in the management of forests, as this Parliament had requested at the time. We must not forget that the Mediterranean forests and the forests of the north develop in completely different ways, and are therefore governed by completely different laws. As well as soil, the growth-restricting factors are water in the Mediterranean forests and light in the northern areas. In the Mediterranean forests, where there is no shortage of light, the higher trees, shrubs and grasses have to compete for water on the ground and, being a restricting factor, there comes a time when every drop of water which falls must be distributed at ground level. The water table is therefore reduced, the roots do not reach that level and they die, and then the above-ground part becomes denser and finally – unfortunately – fire returns repeatedly and we are sent right back to the beginning. This differing development also requires differing forest management and requires that, in the Mediterranean forests, management and prevention form part of an inseparable whole, which is the only way to prevent these waves of fires every summer, the seriousness of which depends on the weather conditions. The Mediterranean forests are part of the common heritage of all Europeans. It is for this reason that forest fires are not just the responsibility of the Member States or regional governments with competence in this field, although there is no question that the correct application of the principle of subsidiarity is essential in order to increase the effectiveness of the measures to be taken. Community competences in the environmental field as well as the commitment made by the European Union in Kyoto require greater budgetary contributions and greater involvement by the European Union in the fight against fires.

Mr President, Commissioner, to ensure that significant progress is made in Cancun on the realisation of the development agenda is not going to be easy, bearing in mind the need to reflect the interests of all the members of the WTO, to take up the concerns of the least-developed countries and in view of the great number of issues to be negotiated. All of these issues are essential to ensuring that multilateral trade relations lead to economic growth, if we want this growth to be equitable and its benefits also to reach the least-developed countries. Hence the need to make progress on all fronts in the development agenda and if possible within the time periods laid down, in line with the support you are providing on behalf of the European Union. In view of the brevity with which I am obliged to speak, I will restrict myself to access to the industrial product markets, in particular, naturally, the textiles and clothing sectors and to respect for the rules which govern international trade. In this regard, I would ask you, Commissioner, to ensure that there is no reduction in the European Union's tariffs while other countries have not reached the tariff levels laid down in the Union. Secondly, that you pay special attention, within the framework of the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, to the issue of designs and the international exhaustion of the registered trademark and to actions to combat counterfeiting and pirating. Finally, I would ask you to promote simplification of the commercial defence mechanisms in order to make them quicker and more effective, because the persistence of tariff barriers, tariff peaks and non-tariff barriers is incompatible with the process of liberalising the markets. Because the rules of the WTO are binding on all members and therefore compliance with them must be guaranteed. But also, because the future of the European textiles and clothing industry depends on it, as the Commissioner is well aware.
Ferrer (PPE-DE

 Madam President, Commissioner, I wish first of all to thank you for being here today and for the statement you have just made, which attests to the sensitivity you have shown throughout the years towards the European textile and clothing sector. In its recent Communication on industrial policy, the Commission acknowledges that the vitality and dynamism of the industry are crucial to Europe’s ability to maintain and increase its prosperity and at the same time achieve its social ambitions. From this statement we can infer the need for a European industrial policy which, in order to be effective, must not only cover the strictly industrial aspects, but must also be a horizontal policy that embraces, amongst others, the social and environmental aspects and above all, trade policy. And if this is valid and necessary for industry in general, and to preserve jobs, it is even more so in the case of the European textile and clothing industry, which has a turnover of EUR 196 billion every year, involves more than 113 000 businesses, provides work for two million people – or 7.6% of total employment in the manufacturing industry – and is characterised by significant regional concentration. Although everyone is aware of these figures, I believe they are worth repeating, because they demonstrate the sector’s importance. This is furthermore a dynamic and competitive industry which, thanks to the efforts made in research and technological development, thanks to the design and quality of the products and as a result of its having specialised, has been able to consolidate and increase its influence and importance for the European and the world economy. It is accordingly worth recalling that the industry in Europe is the world’s largest exporter of textiles, ahead of China, and the third largest in clothing, after China and Hong Kong and consequently has enormous export potential, which needs to be developed. This is precisely why trade policy is so important. Furthermore, however, this sector faces many challenges, in particular – and this is something to which you also referred – the challenge of the quota restriction as of 1 January 2005, which will mean a radical change in the world’s commercial landscape. The sector is very aware of this, since it is one of the most exposed to the effects of globalisation through the stiff competition it faces due to the lower wage costs and the large export capacity of many developing countries. Another challenge facing the industry is China’s accession to the WTO, and by way of illustration, it is worth recalling those studies predicting that once quantity restrictions are eliminated, China could see a 150% increase in its global textile and clothing exports and could consequently gain 50% of the world market share. It is therefore crucial for Europe that markets are genuinely and universally opened up, especially in those countries that are particularly dominant and competitive in the textile and clothing sector but which remain closed to European exports, either as a result of high customs duties, in addition to further duties and taxes, or by means of non-tariff barriers that make trade with those countries unviable. What is needed, Commissioner, for the sector’s survival at European level and for the continued existence of the millions of jobs that are at stake is above all a defensive trade policy. I can therefore only welcome the content of the statement you have just made and simply express my hope that when it comes to discussing your proposals at the WTO, they are truly allowed to prosper. We know that reconciling the totally legitimate interests of European industry with the need to make the development agenda a reality will not be easy, but you do have this Parliament’s full support for achieving this, Commissioner.

 Mr President, first of all I would also like to congratulate Mrs Mann on her report. We are all aware of the fact that trade relations are a factor in economic growth, but it is equally true that not all countries have been able to integrate into the world trade system and take advantage of the opportunities it offers to improve their development, which has increased inequality between rich and poor countries. There is therefore a clear need to manage globalisation by means of multilateral standards drawn up from a policy perspective in order to make trade relations at world level a beneficial force for all, which contributes to the objective of eradicating poverty and achieving fair, sustainable development. It is therefore important for the European Union to define a trade strategy that places the specific needs of less developed countries at the heart of trade negotiations, in order to make possible the gradual incorporation of these countries into the multilateral trade system. In fact, the right of access – including non-reciprocal access – of poorer countries to the markets of developed countries is vastly insufficient for guaranteeing genuine development of trade flow if – as you yourself pointed out, Commissioner – we do not simultaneously strengthen their capacity for industrial and agricultural development, respect for the rules in force in the importing countries and familiarity with trade circuits, as well as their administrative capacities and their financial institutions. For precisely this reason, the Committee on Development and Cooperation fully supports the incorporation of the development aspect into the Doha agenda and welcomes the impetus provided to this end by the European Union, and specifically yourself, Commissioner Lamy, in order to promote this development aspect. At the same time, however, it considers that it is vital to ensure coherence between multilateralism and regionalism, between the rules established by the World Trade Organisation on the liberalisation of regional trade and the development of areas of free trade, including the proliferation of agreements between countries and regions with very different levels of development, because it believes that only this way, with this coherence, will we be able to make trade relations a genuine factor in development for all peoples and finally eradicate poverty.

rapporteur
. – (ES)
 Mr President, Commissioner, I am sorry to have to discuss this report this evening, at this late hour, when it was initially scheduled for Thursday, which could have enhanced this debate on development cooperation. Unfortunately, however, this is the way things are. Commissioner, the experience acquired over the past few decades in the field of development cooperation and the lack of significant results in this field have highlighted the need for a change in the focus of development policies, in order to improve the effectiveness of aid, reduce the chasm between rich and poor countries and thus fulfil the objectives of sustainable development that we have set for ourselves. There are certainly many and varied factors preventing the poorest countries from being able to board the development train and win the battle to eradicate poverty: external debt, first and foremost, the great shame hanging over developing countries, the fratricidal wars that devastate so many poor countries, the AIDS pandemic, corruption at every level of public life, but this failure can also be explained by the use of foreign models and the fact that development objectives have in the past been set without the participation of those receiving aid. We should not be surprised, therefore, that the idea of capacity-building as an essential factor in improving the results of development policies has been gaining ground, in particular since the Rio Declaration of 1992, which recognises the fact that a country’s ability to follow the path of sustainable development is largely determined by the capacity of its people and institutions. The Committee on Development and Cooperation, which fully agrees with this principle, therefore organised a public hearing a few months ago on capacity-building and then agreed that a report should be drawn up on the subject, for which I was given responsibility as rapporteur. It should be noted that this report was unanimously approved, since it was unanimous in committee that capacity-building should constitute a fundamental element in development cooperation, essential to ensuring effective aid. In order better to understand the scope of the proposals contained in the report, I believe it should be specified that, in my eyes, capacity-building is first and foremost a new form of understanding and, above all, implementing development cooperation policy which requires a long-term global strategy that is individually tailored for the various players according to the different environments represented by their society. This strategy should aim to improve skills and the conditions required for a country to be able to improve its levels of economic and social growth. All this should take place in support of national efforts to be carried out by each country for itself based on the plan drawn up by each country according to their specific interests and needs along the lines of what is being done, in particular, with strategy documents for each country. The European Union and its Member States – although not only them, but all international donors – should therefore review their cooperation methods and change the focus of their development policies so that capacity-building, as a participative process based on appropriation, constitutes the basis for the policy, with the aim of enabling individuals, as well as bodies within civil society, to develop their potential and the skills that should allow them to achieve the development objectives that they themselves must also be in a position to determine. We should provide them with the means – in a word – to play a leading role in their own development, to which they have a right. In other words, help them to improve their institutional capacities and achieve the level of training that is necessary in order to open the door to development. We should also help them to diversify and improve production capacity, develop infrastructures and the macroeconomic framework required to attract investment, provide them with technical assistance to increase trade capacity so that they can integrate world trade and thus share in the profits it generates. A development cooperation policy focused along these lines constitutes the most suitable instrument for progress to be made towards eradicating poverty and achieving fair, sustainable development for all. That, Commissioner, is why there is a need – I would say an imperative – for a Commission communication in this regard, to instigate action in the field of development aid from the European Union and its Member States and also the various formulas contained in the motion for a resolution on which we are to vote. For it is only by means of these policies, by providing the necessary means for capacity-building, that we shall be able to put an end to the injustice which means that 20% of the world’s population enjoys 80% of the world’s wealth, while 80% are deprived of the right to live in the dignity that is the inalienable right of each individual.

This is not the first time Parliament has addressed this matter and I do not think it will be the last, and not only because for many of us – and for me, of course – achieving obligatory, free, high-quality universal education for all is the absolute priority of development cooperation. I said that we will continue to talk about it because we are far from being able to achieve the objectives set in Dakar within the anticipated timescale, and we must therefore continue to be vigilant so that there are no further delays and, if possible, to ensure that at least the European Union and the Member States turn the commitments they have made into reality, into practical action, and that they decide not just to give the appearance of making education the priority in development, but really make it a priority, if we genuinely want a fairer society, in which each individual has the same choices and opportunities. In a moment we shall discuss the report for which I am rapporteur, on capacity-building and its key role in improving the effectiveness of development aid. How, though, can we think of capacity-building if 113 million children have never been to school and 150 million have not completed primary education, as the rapporteur points out in his report? For this reason, I can but agree with the measures proposed to give education its rightful place in development cooperation policy and overcome the obstacles that prevent so many boys and girls from having access to education and, with it, the right to a better life. In conclusion, I would like to ask the rapporteur to accept the amendment I tabled together with Mr Corrie, on behalf of the PPE-DE, requesting recognition for the State’s obligation to guarantee the right to education and the role that the private sector can play in making the universal right to education, which sadly is currently the most violated right, a reality.

I have nothing to ask the Commissioner. It was an internal point of order. I think the decision you have made is fine, Mr President, but what I do not understand is why, after the questions set for each of the Commissioners, there is a chapter named ‘Other questions’. I ask this because if I had known that these questions were never going to be answered, I would never have spent so long here; I would have been in my office working. I therefore believe that we should organise our work better and there should either not be an ‘Other questions’ section, or, if there is, the Commission should be warned so that it is in a position to answer them if there is time.

) Europe is now almost reunited. There is a Convention engaged in drafting a European constitution. 
The European Union must be brought closer to its citizens by means of an information policy enabling them to understand how Community institutions operate. This is essential to ensure the Union becomes more transparent and that full advantage is taken of European citizenship. It is difficult to develop that sense of belonging to a community essential to operate as a European citizen without appropriate information on the community one is part of and an understanding of it. I therefore voted in favour of the Bayona report. It charts the way forward clearly and defines the appropriate instruments to enable European citizens to be more involved in the Community they belong to, as indeed they should be. I believe it is particularly helpful that further to adoption of the amendment we tabled, the report recognises the need for this information to be available in the official languages of certain parts of the territory of Member States. This is the case of Catalonia. Languages such as Catalan are part of the identity of peoples who make up the European Union. Their commitment to the European cause and their sense of full European citizenship need to be rooted in that identity.

 Mr President, the repressive process set in train with impunity against Cuban citizens in Cuba has shown up the Castro dictatorship in its true colours once again. All these individuals had done was to attempt to exercise their right to rights, as Oswaldo Payá explained in his address to this House. This amounts to a flagrant violation of fundamental rights and freedoms. In a sense too, it is a response to the Varela Project. The House is honour bound to respond with strong condemnation of the actions of the Castro regime and that caricature of justice subservient to the dictatorship. The House must call for all those imprisoned to be released. It must also speak out against what Oswaldo Payá described as the fallacy or myth that Cubans have to live without rights to sustain the independence and sovereignty of their country. Fundamental rights are not negotiable and their infringement can never be justified. We are called on to assure those fighting for the rights of all Cubans that we stand shoulder to shoulder with them and that their fight is our fight also. Indeed, it is our moral and political duty to do so. We should also assure those who have found the courage to support the Varela Project that we support their efforts to re-empower the people of Cuba by constitutional means. We must do more than simply condemn, however. I therefore call on the Commissioner to reject Cuba’s request to participate in the Cotonou Agreement if by the time the request comes up for consideration repression still persists and those detained have not been released. I would call on the Council to act in this way too, if the Council were represented here today. Article 9(2) of the aforementioned agreement requires Cuba to make a commitment to human rights. In no way can such a commitment be compatible with the repression currently endured by so many Cuban citizens merely because of their love of freedom.

We have just written a page in the history of our continent: by voting in favour of accession, we have taken a definitive step in the process of reconciling the people of Europe; we have repaired an historical injustice; we have made it possible for politics to triumph as an instrument at the service of peace at a time when the horror of war is returning, reminding us that peace is not a given, but that we have to preserve it. In order for the stage we have reached today to really represent a reunification of Europe it is essential that the Union acquires a Constitution which guarantees the effective and democratic functioning of its institutions and its political dimension. Only in that way will we ensure that Europe continues to be the dream of freedom and well-being which the countries we have said yes to today have signed up to. It is essential that we do not forget the profound significance of the European idea and that we confirm the continued existence of those values which have made the union of the continent possible; the supremacy of the human being and respect for their dignity, solidarity, social justice and the quest for the common good.

Mr President, I would like to insist that the seriousness of the events taking place in Cuba requires an in-depth debate, and I would therefore be delighted if we could pursue the idea of an oral question with an in-depth debate on the issue. I would also like to insist, however, that one issue does not cancel out the other. I therefore believe that the seriousness of the summary trials which have taken place, the seriousness of the arrests suffered by people who have simply exercised their right to free expression, or the right to employ the law in force to create areas of freedom, requires that this House immediately speak out in order to send a message of hope to these people who are currently experiencing great suffering and worry and I believe it would be very positive if on Thursday we can condemn what is taking place in Cuba.

The increasingly open and competitive economic environment in which the business world has to operate these days and the need to promote a form of economic growth capable of guaranteeing the employment and social well-being of the citizens, fully justifies the strategy and the agreements adopted by the European Council to provide that strategy with new impetus. These agreements should have been much more ambitious in terms of their proposed scope and the fields covered, in view of the accumulated delays in the implementation of the measures agreed in Lisbon. So I have voted in favour of the resolution, but I regret that it does not include a reference to the need to guarantee access to third-country markets on a reciprocal basis and with full respect for the rules governing international trade, an aspect which I believe to be essential. In terms of maintaining and improving employment, the measures will be of little use, however necessary they are, if our companies are not able to export as a result of the unfair competition in the field of external trade which the EU is obliged to control.

Mr President, Commissioner, a society that calls itself civilised and that prides itself on its defence of human rights cannot accept as inevitable the high maternal and child mortality rates of the developing countries and the suffering of so many women. Therefore, within the framework of a global policy to combat poverty, the aspects relating to sexual and reproductive health demand special attention. Hence the need for a proposed regulation of the type we are debating, in the understanding that, when we talk about the right to sexual and reproductive health, we are talking about the right to health services which ensure safe pregnancy and birth, for both mother and child. We are talking about the right to information and guidance on family planning methods which are safe and acceptable to everyone, the right to an education which teaches people to live their sexuality in a responsible manner and to combat sexually-transmitted diseases, particularly AIDS. Under no circumstances must this Regulation – and this is what I believe – open the door to the practice of abortion in the developing countries, and this is not for religious or moral reasons and far less for sectarian reasons. It is a question of prioritising the right to life, particularly the lives of the most vulnerable beings, because this right is more important than any other and is the basis and the principle on which all other rights stand. Therefore, within the framework of the fight against poverty, it is very important that the Community commit itself to carrying out actions in the field of sexual and reproductive health in line with the proposals of the Sandbæk report, because these actions are instruments intended to drastically reduce maternal and child mortality and to prevent, as a consequence, the resort to abortion, since they are also instruments intended to protect the right to life and health. And I would hope, Commissioner, that you also share this approach. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to express the satisfaction of the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – and mine in particular – at the conclusion of this association agreement between the Community and its Member States and Chile, the most ambitious, innovative and global agreement the European Union has ever negotiated with a country which is not a candidate for accession, to use the words of the European Commission, in line with what, as has been said already, should be the bi-regional strategic partnership between Latin America and the European Union that this Parliament proposed. Furthermore, I would like to, and must, congratulate Mr Salafranca on the work he has done in order to realise this work and the Commission on the efforts and guidance it has contributed to the conclusion of this Agreement, which began as soon as Chile had recovered its rights and freedoms, which would not have been possible without the political vision and tenacity of the Chilean leaders, from President Elwin to the current President, President Lagos, and which reflects the will of Chile and of the European Union and its Member States to establish privileged relations in the political, commercial and cooperation fields which the agreement encompasses and to strengthen links, as a result of the shared values which unite them. Within the framework of the liberalisation of the markets, the benefits in terms of economic growth and sustainable development which may result from reciprocal economic and trade relations is unquestionable, as are the benefits of a political dialogue aimed at promoting democracy and the formulation of common responses to the great challenges of this millennium. That is why I am convinced that this agreement – which my group will support resoundingly – is a very positive step not only for relations between the European Union and Chile, but also for the economic and social well-being of the Chilean people in their democratic journey, which has so far been recovered in such an exemplary fashion, and which must serve, and in reality does serve, as an example to Latin America during these difficult times for some of its countries.

Mr President, I very much regret that the Commissioner is unable to be with us. It seems to me that it might be wise to adjust our arrangements so that the Commissioner himself could read the text to be adopted. He ought to see the agreements reached in the common resolution through. We would then transcend mere words. I am sure we all agree that the terrible scourge of hunger in the world casts shame on all those who are in a position to prevent it. The figures speak for themselves. We are all aware of the alarming statistics. Nonetheless, I believe they bear repetition. I would venture to say that we are numbered amongst the lucky few who live comfortably, in an affluent society. Meanwhile, 900 people die of hunger every hour. In addition, 800 million people are malnourished and 300 of these are children. What is worse, the numbers remain stubbornly high and we are light years away from reaching the target of halving the number of malnourished people by the year 2015. That was the date set at the 1996 World Food Summit and confirmed in the Millennium Declaration. It is not a particularly ambitious target. Nonetheless, we are unlikely to reach it despite the fact that a number of countries have made determined efforts to reduce poverty and improve food safety. The current state of affairs as portrayed by these statistics proves beyond all doubt that the time for words and for grand declarations is long since past, particularly if account is also taken of the implications of malnutrition and their negative impact on development in the countries concerned. Hunger cannot wait. The time has come to take a quantum leap as regards the strategy needed to rid ourselves of this scourge. We need to go to the very root of the problem if we are to deal with the structural causes of world hunger. Tackling the root of the problem and going beyond the current crisis means making human development a priority. A two-pronged approach is called for. In the short and medium term it is necessary to focus on food safety and food sovereignty, crucial to alleviating present-day hunger. In the longer term, sustainable growth for less-developed countries must be promoted. The purpose of such a two-pronged approach would be to help establish the social, political and economic framework needed to allow those countries to eliminate poverty and start down the road to development. The causes of hunger and underdevelopment are many and varied. Consequently, a wide range of remedies must be deployed in the effort to reach these twin targets. All the factors contributing to hunger need to be dealt with. Natural disasters, droughts, floods and desertification are but some of these factors. Others include armed conflicts, civil unrest, political, social and economic upheavals, the AIDS pandemic and the foreign debt incurred by the poorest countries. Two main courses of action can be identified. On the one hand, regarding food sovereignty, it is essential to promote small-scale farming of sustainable and diversified crops. This is provided for in the common resolution we trust will be approved in plenary. Urgent action must also be taken to ensure the development of viable networks for local distribution, access to land and to water and the cancellation of foreign debt. Turning to the reduction of poverty and with development in mind, priority should be given to education. I mean education for all, girls included. Girls tend to be excluded from educational programmes as a matter of course, and are thus also excluded from all potential development of their countries. Increased technological capacity should also be fostered as part of this drive towards education and training. By technological capacity I am referring in particular to productive capacity. Efforts to combat diseases linked to poverty, notably AIDS, must be stepped up. What I actually have in mind are all the measures designed to promote good governance and the rule of law. As indicated in our resolution, I also believe it is particularly important to facilitate access to the markets on equal terms, and on a reciprocal basis. Measures that distort trade should gradually be done away with. More specifically, as is also stated in the resolution and in line with the agreements reached at Doha, I believe agricultural subsidies should be eliminated. I am not referring merely to the European Union. After all, the Union’s market is the most accessible to the less developed countries. Rather, I am thinking of the whole international community, especially the richer industrialised countries. If we are to set the less developed countries on course for sustainable development to eliminate hunger we cannot shy away from these measures. They are essential and have to be taken. Peace itself is at stake, at both a social and international level.

This Parliament has just missed a great opportunity to act in accordance with its role as representative of the peoples of Europe as laid down in the Treaties. Firstly, and this is the most serious thing, because by approving amendment by Mr Méndez de Vigo – whose ‘care’ has been noted – we are depriving the European peoples of their capacity as holders of some of the Union’s legitimacy, which, in accordance with the philosophy of the Treaties, they are entitled to. Secondly, because the final text lays down that the regions with legislative powers will not be able to bring cases before the Court of Justice on their own behalf, and that they must do so with the prior agreement of the State. The Socialist amendment, proposing that the case should be presented through the intermediary of the State, was not much better. Thirdly, nor are these regions explicitly guaranteed the right to participate in Councils of Ministers which deal with matters falling within their competence, leaving this capacity to arbitrate to the respective governments whose lack of political will in relation to this issue is, in the majority of cases, including Spain, notorious. The Napolitano report, however, still contains some very positive aspects and I have therefore decided to vote in favour of it tomorrow.
Ferrer (PPE-DE

Mr President, if the principle of subsidiarity is one of the basic pillars of Europe, if we want to bring the European institutions closer to the citizens and improve the democracy and transparency of Community policies, it largely falls to sub-State regions to apply Community decisions and if, furthermore, there are regions with legislative powers whose competences are directly affected by the policies of the Union, we cannot continue to deny those regions the opportunity to participate in the process of European construction. I do not agree with those people who have said that this is a responsibility of each Member State, which is contrary to the principle of subsidiarity. Because the possibility of participation by the regions in the taking of decisions which affect them is the result, and not the cause, of the internal organisation which each State has laid down. The Napolitano report attempts to define the role of local and regional powers in the Union’s decision-making process. But it is too timid an approach, which does not respond to the needs of the regions with legislative powers, which – on the basis of their democratic legitimacy – have the right to be active members in the process of European construction. The regions with legislative powers, Mr Napolitano, Commissioner Barnier, wish to participate in the Council of Ministers when it is dealing with issues which fall within their competence and, contrary to what has been said here, they want to be able to bring cases before the Court of Justice in the event of violations of the principle of subsidiarity. This participation and will, if recognised by the future Constitution, would not represent a free concession, but a right of the regions, such as Catalonia, which the European Union, and this Parliament in particular, as the representative of the European people, must respect if it really wants to listen to the citizens.

Mr President, as one of the proposers of the candidature of Oswaldo Payá for the Sakharov Prize, I would like to thank you and other Members of the European Parliament for your efforts, thanks to which the Castro Government has finally allowed Oswaldo Payá to leave Cuba and, above all, return, so that he can receive the prize which this Parliament has awarded him for his peaceful struggle for reconciliation of the Cuban people and for areas of freedom. Mr President, the decision of the recent Copenhagen European Council is a victory for freedom and democracy in the face of the two totalitarian regimes which desolated Europe. This is an historical step which should not make us forget those people who are still deprived, as Oswaldo Payá puts it, of the right to rights. Therefore, Mr President, and in view of the European Union’s commitment to democracy and human rights, I would ask you, on behalf of this House, to urge the Asamblea Nacional del Poder Popular
 to process the Varela project, which has become a draft law thanks to the more than 11 000 signatures accompanying it, so that the people of Cuba can finally regain their voices and freely determine their own destiny.

Mr President, Commissioner, as Christian Democrats, and as the PPE-DE Group, our commitment to the defence of the value of human life and dignity, and the defence of the fundamental rights and freedoms required for that dignity, lead us once again to vigorously condemn the violations of human life and dignity represented by the death sentences – and, what is more, death by stoning – handed down in strict application of Islamic law; and to urge the authorities responsible to show clemency in order to prevent the ignominy of the execution of such sentences. It also leads us to remind not only the Federal State of Nigeria, but also Niger, Sudan and Somalia, that the current interpretation and application of the sharia
 is not only a clear violation of fundamental rights, but that it evidently contravenes the international commitments to human rights which they have signed up to, including the Cotonou agreements, article one of which clearly states that the rights of the individual will be respected and that the situation of women and issues of sex equality will systematically be taken into account in all areas, political, economic and social. Therefore, as well as our absolute rejection of the death sentences which have been handed down, and as well as asking for mercy for Amina Lawal, Ahmadu Ibrahin and Fatima Usman, we must and want to demand that the governments of these countries bring their legislation into line with the international standards and commitments in the field of human rights, in order to prevent an application of the sharia
 which violates human rights. Furthermore, as the European Union we must be prepared to use the mechanisms available to us under the Cotonou agreements in the event of the violation of the principles they stand for. Only in this way, Mr President, will we contribute to progress on freedom and respect for human rights in the world.

 Just like the Monterrey Conference, the World Food Summit has sadly been yet another wasted opportunity. The EU and the Member States could have shown, not only with words but also through action, their commitment to the fight that the United Nations has embarked on in order to end poverty and hunger in the world. Once again, however, we achieved nothing more than grand declarations of principle and we have not been able to adopt the necessary measures and allocate the necessary resources to turn words into action. We continue to proclaim the right of each individual to have access to healthy, nutritious food, yet we are incapable of taking action to allow this right to be exercised by the poorest people. We limited ourselves to repeating the commitment to halving the number of malnourished people by 2015, which is not only totally insufficient but is now impossible to accomplish given the failure to adopt generous, effective measures. That is why I have voted for the Resolution on the Rome Summit, because it proposes solutions that attempt to get to the heart of the problem and address not only the consequences but also the causes of poverty and the lack of food in the world.

First of all I would like to say that I consider it a serious political error that the Conference of Presidents has authorised the production of a report which clearly violates the principle of subsidiarity, especially when there is about to be a referendum in Ireland. This is one of the reasons why I have voted against. The European Union does not have competence in the field of sexual or reproductive health – as Commissioner Byrne clearly reminded us yesterday – which falls to the Member States. This is shown by the fact that the report does not make legislative proposals but restricts itself to making recommendations to the governments of the Member States and the candidate countries. But above all I have voted against the report because I do not agree in any way with its proposals. The value of human life must be preserved and not destroyed. It is one thing to promote appropriate sexual information programmes, family planning and contraception advice and sexual health services, and it is quite another to recommend the legalisation of abortion. The right to life takes precedence over any other right, including women’s rights, and its defence must be the main objective of the policies implemented by public authorities.

As part of the work of the Convention and in thinking about drawing up a Constitution that will enable us not only to successfully complete the enlargement process that is in progress but above all to provide the European Union with a democratic and effective government that responds to the challenges and concerns of the world in which we live, dividing competences between the European Union and the Member States is essential. In order to ensure that the Union functions properly we need to define the responsibilities of each of the institutional levels within it. And for those of us who advocate a federal model, that division of competences means that we can establish a federal rather than a subordinate relationship between the Union, the Member States and the regions with legislative powers, which is the foundation for a federal Europe based on the principle of subsidiarity. That is why this excellent report by Mr Lamassoure is so important and why I have voted in favour of it. It is a shame that the proposal to create a status for a region associated with the European Union was ultimately rejected through the opposition of those who do not wish to understand that the European Union is a global entity that does not end at the borders of the Member States. But it must be said that the Lamassoure report has taken a step in the right direction. The fundamental texts of the European Union cannot continue to ignore the existence and functions of the regions with legislative powers as a result of, in cases such as Catalonia, an irrefutable sense of collective identity, because those regions are responsible for managing a large proportion of Community policies and because Europe cannot be built behind the backs of the people that are part of it.

 Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation I would firstly like to thank the Commission for their communication on the promotion of human rights and also congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Díez González, on her excellent report, which complements and strengthens the already positive proposals put forward by the Commission in their communication. The European Union’s commitment to the defence of human rights and democratic principles needs effective, and above all coherent, action; if there is no coherence, there is no credibility, and without credibility there is no authority to promote and demand respect for human rights. For this reason I support the strategic and comprehensive approach proposed by the Commission with regard to integrating human rights into EU foreign policy and ensuring that all policies, all Community programmes and projects, take this issue into account. Finally, I support the approach geared towards humanitarian aid based on human rights, because of the importance it can have in terms of conflict prevention, and I believe that Country Strategy Papers should propose specific measures for the promotion of human rights, which should be treated as a priority. The struggle for human rights cannot be disassociated from the fight against poverty and development cooperation policy, inasmuch as both promote the establishment of the economic and social conditions necessary to guarantee peace and to ensure that everyone can live in dignity; conditions without which the respect for fundamental rights is no more than a pipe dream. For this reason I would make a particular request to the Commission that, in the context of political dialogue and the discussion of the Country Strategy Papers, universal access to education should be considered as a priority issue, because education is indispensable for the development of populations, and without development it will be very difficult for us to talk about full respect for human rights.

 Mr President, a society that calls itself civilised, such as European society, which prides itself on its defence of human rights, cannot remain impassive when faced with the situation of many millions of children worldwide who are denied the rights we claim we want to defend; children condemned to death by AIDS or malnutrition, or through a lack of medical care, or who are destined to live in absolutely wretched conditions. It is true that the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Action Plan approved at the 1990 World Summit attempt to guarantee that children are able to exercise their fundamental rights, but unfortunately, there has been no improvement at all in the situation, and children continue to be the main victims of poverty and underdevelopment, amongst other things. The statistics speak for themselves, and we should not forget that behind each of these figures hides the face of a child, whose eyes are pleading for our help. For this reason, the special session of the UN General Assembly on Children, which is about to take place, should result in a firm commitment to transform the obligations arising from the Convention on the Rights of the Child into real action, establishing control mechanisms to supervise the extent to which these obligations are complied with, especially with regard to the fight against abuse, exploitation and violence to which children are subjected and to guarantee children the right to education. But also, and above all, the Assembly should lead to a commitment to adopt more coherent and more generous development cooperation policies and policies to combat poverty, in order to guarantee every child’s fundamental right to decent living conditions. And, since the family is the fundamental unit of society and bears the main responsibility for protecting and raising children and the monitoring of their development, it is crucial that we also promote family assistance policies that contribute to the creation of the human environment that is essential to a child’s development and to his or her being able, in the future, to become a useful member of the community to which he or she belongs. Parliament must give a clear mandate to the European Union in this direction. Therefore, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I would ask this House to support the joint resolution we are debating and the amendments we have tabled and which were already part of the text that this Parliament approved in July 2001 for this very sitting of the United Nations, which should have taken place in September; because, with this vote, we will make the cause of children our own, the cause of the European Parliament and the cause of the European Union.

 Nothing can justify the violation of an individual’s fundamental rights and freedoms and which issue from that individual’s inalienable dignity. I am therefore against fundamentalism as the expression of a way of thinking that denies a person – man or woman – their freedom and the right to choose their own destiny, and It is my view that the European Union must, with every means at its disposal, uphold and promote respect for human rights wherever they are violated. I cannot, however, accept the implicit censure of religious values and actual religion that the Izquierdo report makes, under cover of its censure of fundamentalism – and not only in relation to Christianity. It is one thing to freely espouse religious principles that accord with respect for human rights; it is quite another to impose rules of behaviour that entail the negation of individual dignity and the infringement of such rights. It is one thing to support the separation of Church and State, a position I fully share because it is the basis of the democratic system, but quite another to deny the Church and religious communities their right to freedom of expression in the name of secularity – in other words their right to interpret, according to their way of thinking, the facts of public and political life that govern citizens’ lives. By adopting this report today, the European Parliament has done the cause of the freedoms we wish to promote no favours, because behind the censure of fundamentalism there is in fact a new form of fundamentalism that they are trying to impose on us: secular fundamentalism, which is just as deserving of censure as any other, in that they all deny the freedom of the individual to choose his or her own model in life. This is the reason why I voted against the report.

The fact that the process of European integration is at such a decisive point, as a result of the enlargement under way, on the one hand, and the new political and economic challenges facing the EU, on the other, demands the cooperation of both the European Parliament and the parliaments of the Member States so that the citizens, via their legitimate representatives, may participate in this process. Hence the timeliness of the excellent Napolitano report and my vote in favour of it. Since, while it is clearly necessary to guarantee the democratic control of Community policies and decision making, it is also clear that this control must be carried out while respecting each of the areas of parliamentary activity. In this respect, I believe the commitment given by Mr Napolitano, as chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to draw up a report in the near future on the role of parliaments in the constitutional regions within this process is particularly positive. The regions with legislative powers are a fundamental part of the mechanism, and not only because they are closer to the citizens, but also because the parliaments of these regions, as legitimate representatives of the people making up the Union, have the right to participate within the framework of their competences in the control of the legislative process for Community policies and to have a voice so that they can defend their interests.

 Mr President, one of the consequences of globalisation is the emergence of the feeling of belonging to the world. This means that our citizens increasingly feel that the poverty and underdevelopment in which a large part of the population lives affect them and makes them demand that the public authorities demonstrate greater commitment in the field of development 
cooperation.
 Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I hope that this message is conveyed to you when you arrive: responding to this request from the citizens for greater solidarity requires giving the least-developed countries the opportunity to implement the changes necessary to achieve the progress and well-being of their peoples and to make the framework that you have described for us this morning and, with which we are very happy, a reality. It also requires, however, a fixed-term commitment to go beyond what was agreed in Laeken and to establish a strict timetable for States that have not yet done so to achieve, within the deadline set, the objective of allocating 0.7% of gross domestic product to official development aid and to do so in order to comply with an ethical requirement: we cannot continue to tolerate the living conditions that so many millions of people, who embody our own dignity and our own rights, are forced to endure. Solidarity is part of our acquis

We must also make this commitment for the sake of coherence, because the challenge of eradicating poverty, which the European Union has taken up, requires a budgetary effort in line with the magnitude of the task facing us. And because, without development, democracy and respect for human rights are nothing more than pipe dreams. And, lastly, because contributing to the progress and development of peoples is the best weapon with which to ensure international peace and security, something that, unfortunately, not all countries seem to understand.

Commissioner, you have given me such a complete answer that I have few remaining doubts to ask you about. Nevertheless, I would like to insist that the measures he says are going to be adopted, above all in relation to the simplification of the regulations, be genuinely implemented and applied as quickly as possible. Great declarations, great words and great policies are all very well for existing undertakings, but it is essential that those who – inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit which we are so keen to promote – decide to create a new undertaking, are not faced with obstacles and difficulties which prevent them from going ahead. Furthermore, and in order that this policy may be truly effective, information on actions implemented by the Commission must reach the smaller entrepreneurs, a sector which very much needs it.

I have voted in favour of the Rod report because I support the signing of the Cotonou Agreement. This is for various reasons. Firstly, because through this agreement the EU is reaffirming its commitment to the ACP countries, and therefore its will to contribute to the sustainable economic and social development of those countries. Secondly, because it makes the eradication of poverty by means of gradual integration into the world economy the main objective of the agreement. And thirdly, because the political dimension it includes could make a major contribution to removing the obstacles which have largely prevented ACP-EU cooperation from bearing the fruits we expected. In fact, without democracy and peace, it is not possible to promote economic development or to guarantee that the benefits of that development reach the whole population to an equal degree. Hence the importance of the political dialogue, good government and the prevention of conflicts that the agreement seeks to achieve. I therefore do not agree with many of the criticisms contained in the explanatory statement accompanying the Rod report. It is true that everything in this world can be improved, but Cotonou represents a step forward in the EU’s development cooperation policy. It is a step which many others must follow, particularly in relation to Parliament’s control of EDF funds. This agreement, however, takes us in the right direction.

 Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Lagendijk on his excellent report on conflict prevention, a subject on which Parliament’s position has always been very clear. There can be no doubt that the best way to win a war is to prevent it from happening in the first place and in order to do this there is no better weapon than to be able to see it coming. That is to say, to find the underlying causes of war and to work to resolve them. In order to do this, it is essential that we do not take a solely horizontal approach – an approach quite rightly proposed by Mr Lagendijk –, that is to say, one that includes all of the European Union’s common policies, but also a global approach, which includes the whole of society. From this point of view non-structural methods to promote reconciliation are important, above all in those regions emerging from conflict. Without these methods, all of the international community’s peace efforts, or those of the very local communities which the conflict has created, could come to nothing, given that the least dispute can once again light the flames of hatred that had provoked or been the cause of the conflict in the first place. We need – and I address this particularly to the Commission – to dedicate not only more attention but, above all, more resources to education for peace programmes, along the lines of the work carried out by Mr Mayor Zaragoza when he was the Director-General of Unesco and which Kofi Annan reminded us of a few days ago. On the other hand, if control of the arms trade is very important, then so is the traffic in diamonds and raw materials. In this respect, I would also ask the Commission to tell us which methods it intends to adopt in order to improve, and make more efficient, the code of conduct with regard to the control of the trafficking in diamonds, in particular, given that, as the European institutions and the United Nations themselves have reported, on many occasions the fight for raw materials is behind many of the world’s conflicts, especially in Africa.

Madam President, I also consider the results of the ministerial conference in Doha to be positive and I would therefore like to join other Members in congratulating Commissioner Lamy, Commissioner Fischler and the Council on their unquestionable contribution to this success. It is true that the final declaration does not say everything it should say and, I would say, that sometimes it says more than it should say, but any negotiation means reaching compromises and compromise requires concessions. The thing we must really value about Doha is the bringing together of the diverging, and sometimes contradictory, interests of the Member countries of the WTO and an agreement has been reached to launch a new round, set an agenda, a timetable and a working programme, and, secondly, that the development dimension has been fully integrated into all negotiations and that the least-developed countries and the developing countries have spoken out strongly and their voice has been heard and their concerns taken into account. The WTO train, as you said quite rightly, Commissioner Lamy, is back on the rails and has already left the station. I would add that furthermore the means have been provided so that its destination may be a sustainable growth which also benefits the poorest countries. However, in order for that train to reach its destination, the necessary means must be adopted, the texts must be interpreted correctly, since they are full of structural ambiguities, and guarantee reciprocity in the opening up of the markets and full respect for the rules which govern multilateral trade. In order to help to overcome the barrier of poverty once and for all, we must adopt the necessary measures to facilitate access, above all by the least-developed countries, because these countries may suffer as a result of the multilateral commercial system, due to the advantages we offer to the developing countries.

Mr President, I would like, firstly, to also congratulate Mr Fiori on his excellent report, which I fully agree with, because the very hopeful future possibilities offered to us by biotechnology must not lead us to forget that the human being cannot, under any circumstances, be used as an instrument at the service of science, and Mr Fiori’s report clearly defines ethical limits for biotechnological research. In fact, a supposedly civilised society such as ours, which flies the flag of human rights, cannot tolerate the manipulation of the human being, even in its embryonic state, however noble the objective may be. Therefore, research using embryonic mother cells, even if they are surplus, human cloning – of whatever kind, because it is all the same, since it means the destruction of a human being or opens the door to that possible destruction – and the creation of embryos for research, are unacceptable practices because they attack the dignity of the human being and the supreme value of life which this Parliament, and the European Union, claims to defend so passionately.

Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would firstly like to thank you for the efforts you have made and the strategy you have employed in preparing for the Doha Summit, to promote fairer and more balanced sustainable development on a world scale, which contributes to respect for fundamental social rights and the protection of the environment, the benefits of which also reach the least-developed countries. Kofi Annan recently said that the Doha Summit must be the development summit. If this is to be the case, it is essential that the developing countries can be fully integrated into the structures of the WTO and they must be given easier access to world trade. That is why I want to insist on the importance of the technical measures for developing countries, because it is these measures which will allow these countries to take full advantage of the commercial opportunities offered by the liberalisation of the markets. Repealing or renegotiating the agreements already adopted is not the solution. On the contrary, in Doha the European Union must remind all the member countries of the WTO that it is necessary to respect the commitments made in the existing agreements, just as the European Union has respected its commitments. I am thinking specifically of the textile industry, which has strictly respected its commitment to open up its market, increasing quotas and progressively increasing the application of the GATT rules in the sector, which is something that not all countries have done, including the most developed countries. It is true that trade, even if it is multilateral, will not in itself resolve the inequalities of our planet, but it may reduce them by reconciling the interests and concerns of all the parties involved, especially those of the weakest. The European Union has proven experience in this task and we hope that after Doha, by following the line we have taken until now, Commissioner, we can finally succeed in it.

Mr President, Commissioner, it is fair that I begin my speech on behalf of the PPE Group by congratulating Mrs Kinnock on her excellent report and on the passion with which she is defending it. I believe that the proposals in this report, together with the resolution which we approved at the last part-session in July, represent the best contribution this Parliament could have made to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children, because there is no question, unfortunately, that education is still the great unresolved issue within development cooperation, despite the formal declarations and the commitments given at the various international conferences which have addressed this issue. The figures on the millions of children not attending school, which Mrs Kinnock pointed out, speak for themselves in this respect. While it is a grave situation that so many children are being deprived of their fundamental right to education, it is even more grave that, as a result of the violation of this right, millions of people are immersed in poverty and under-development. Because the key to prosperity and progress, especially in the context of the information and communication society which we live in today, lies in the level of education the people have access to. The conviction that, by not dealing vigorously with the issue of education in the developing countries, we will not only fail to eradicate poverty, but that the gap between the rich and poor countries will increase, has certainly led us to place education at the centre of the global strategy for eradicating poverty. In this respect, we have to recognise that the Dakar Conference on education for all represented a great step forward, but it is a step which will take us nowhere if action is not taken and if, in accordance with the decisions at Dakar, we do not quickly adopt a concrete world initiative directed towards creating strategies and mobilising the resources required to provide effective support for the efforts made on a national level – as one of the Dakar commitments states. The European Union, as the main donor and insofar as it has made solidarity and the defence of human rights an essential dimension of its international action, has the responsibility to promote these strategies in close coordination with the other donors, including the Monetary Fund and the World Bank and with the participation of civil society and, with them, policies aimed at overcoming the obstacles which deny children access to a quality education. And the European Union has the moral and political obligation to provide the financial resources necessary to achieve free education for all between now and 2015. All of this can be done in accordance with the excellent proposals contained in the Kinnock report, which reflect both the practically unanimous feelings of the Committee on Development and the feelings of my group. However, achieving this objective will also require us to urgently either cancel or restructure the debts of the developing countries in exchange for the funds made available as a result being directed to education programmes. It will require making the developing countries themselves responsible and encouraging them, through persuasive measures if necessary, to fulfil the commitments given in Dakar and to give absolute priority to education. Above all, it will require an increase in financial contributions and the allocation of at least 8% of official aid to development and to basic education, in line with the views of the people promoting the campaign for education for all. Only through resources which match the challenge we have to face will it be possible to win the battle against illiteracy in the world. I will end by saying that only in this way will it be possible for millions of children to exercise their fundamental right to education, an education which will allow them to open the doors to progress and one day become free men and women.

Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Wuori and Mr Cornillet on their reports and the excellent work they have done. However, I regret that Mr Wuori’s report does not refer to the situation of one of the most violated fundamental rights and the most forgotten: the right to education, to receiving essential basic training as a means for escaping the underdevelopment and poverty which so many children and adults are condemned to living in because they are not guaranteed this fundamental right. In fact, according to Unicef data, 130 million children have never been to school and a further 150 million have started primary education but have left it before becoming fully literate. In sub-Saharan Africa, furthermore, the figure for children not attending school is increasing, rather than decreasing. This is in spite of the objectives set by the World Conference on Education for All at Jomtien, in 1990, or at the World Education Forum which took place in Dakar in 2000. Given this situation, we cannot close our eyes, nor ignore the lack of political will of the European Union and its Member States when it comes to translating the rhetoric of great declarations into budgetary contributions. If we say we are going to defend human rights, we must also defend the right to education at all costs. With the same vigour with which we defend the right to life or the right to non-discrimination or the right to freedom of expression. Let us not forget that human rights are indivisible, inalienable and universal.

Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on this magnificent report on an issue which I truly believe to be of extraordinary importance. We have made many statements in this Parliament and have adopted many measures in favour of the least-developed countries, aware of the importance of removing the barriers separating the rich countries from the poor countries, but, as the rapporteur has reminded us, these barriers, rather than being reduced, are actually increasing. If we bear in mind the great potential of the information technologies for the future development of our society, there is no doubt that this gap is going to increase. We will thereby prevent the developing countries from overcoming the poverty threshold within which they live, and from benefiting from the numerous possibilities which the information society offers, not only for economic development, but also in the fields of health, training and many others. Let us not forget that, according to current estimates, at the end of 2000 there were 700 million people ‘on-line’ in the world while, on the other hand, 2 billion people had never spoken on the telephone. Hence the need to ensure that developing countries have access to the information society and benefit from those future projects which it represents. That is why this report is so important and above all why it is so important that the European Union adopts a vigorous initiative so that developing countries may really be included in the wealth society.

The need to provide the EU with instruments that can cope with the challenge of enlargement explains the importance of the institutional reform that should have taken place in Nice, and also the disappointment with the results that were achieved and, above all, with the lack of ambition and political will shown by the Heads of State and Government, who were more concerned with how to block decisions than with finding formulae that would enable us to move forward towards a shared future. It is true that some progress was made, but Nice is very far removed from what was expected and needed from it, as the reform agreed on does not serve to make a more efficient and democratic EU in view of enlargement, as is shown, moreover, by the annex on post-Nice that accompanies the final Treaty. Therefore, the Méndez de Vigo-Seguro report should have been more emphatic, because it was important for Parliament to highlight the inadequacies of Nice and send a clear signal about this, which is why I also regret that some of the amendments tabled that were going in that direction did not stand. But aside from this, the report contains some aspects, above all regarding the need to use a method similar to the Convention that drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights and also the need to begin a constitutional process culminating in the adoption of the European Union Constitution, which made me inclined to vote in favour of it, despite my conviction that Nice was a wasted opportunity.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I too should like to highlight the appropriate timing of this debate in the context of the Third United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries, which is now being held in Brussels. And precisely for that reason I believe it is worth putting the debate in context by reminding ourselves that the world of the 49 least developed countries at which the measure we are concerned with is aimed is a world where life expectancy barely exceeds 50 years, where 10% of infants die before their first birthday, where 50% of children under five suffer from malnutrition, and where the average per capita GDP is little more than EUR 282 per year. These are figures that still shock us even though are they well known. They shock us, first of all, because these figures are not just abstract statistics but speak for those who cannot speak for themselves, and because we know that every figure reflects real conditions which affect people who are also real. People who have the same rights and the same dignity as we have, who see poverty and underdevelopment looming over them for the simple reason that they were born where they were born. Secondly, these figures shock us because, despite the aid and development policies that the European Union and the Member States carry out to fight poverty and underdevelopment throughout the world, not only are the figures not coming down but the abyss separating the rich countries from the poor countries is growing ever deeper. Now, changing the reality reflected by these figures means we must not just sit back in resignation but must enter the field of action and practical measures. Thus on behalf of my Group I should like to congratulate you, Commissioner, on the ‘Everything but arms’ initiative. This initiative is a good step in the right direction, although to optimise the results that may come of it additional measures should be taken in additional fields. That is precisely why I regret the fact that the Council, under pressure from certain Member States which I prefer not to name, has introduced longer transitional periods, as has already been reported, which may lessen and in any case delay the impact of this initiative on these countries’ economies. I also regret the points in the draft resolution of the report we are discussing which were highlighted by the representative of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, which show a desire either to protect the interests of the Member States or to safeguard the advantages of the ACP countries. Both these interests and these advantages may be legitimate. But in no case, in the Christian Democrat view, should they prevail over the duty of the European Union to foster lasting economic and social development in developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, as the Treaty stipulates.

 Commissioner, first of all I should like to thank you for your answer and very briefly request that, since the Commission is the Guardian of the Treaties and the Treaties state that the Community must contribute to the enhancement of the cultures of the Member States and to respect for regional diversity, it should ensure that those Member States within which several languages that also have official status coexist can take part in organising the events planned for the European Year of Languages. That is, you have said that no State had excluded any language from taking part. That in itself is good news, but it is not enough for them to be able to take part. It is very important that representatives of the peoples that use these languages should also be able to take part in the body that is to organise the events, as stated in the report we approved at the time, in order to guarantee their presence and enhancement.

 Mr President, before I begin my intervention on this report, I should like to ask that it be recorded in the Minutes that in accordance with Rule 161 of the Rules of Procedure the explanatory statement in the report under discussion is the responsibility of the rapporteur alone and only reflects her personal opinion, not the opinion of the Committee on Industry. There is no reason why citizens should know our Rules and certain statements may lend themselves to confusion and give rise to misunderstandings. Thank you, Mr President, and now I shall begin my intervention. The proposal for a decision contained in the Commission proposal, which is the subject of the report we are beginning to debate, is the culmination of a long process that began in 1995 with the signing of a joint declaration between the European Community and Mexico. This declaration established some objectives that were to become an agreement that would replace the Cooperation Agreement signed in 1991, in order to strengthen and enhance the political, economic and commercial relations between the European Union and Mexico. The Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement, also known as the Global Agreement, was signed in December 1997. Therefore, the Commission proposal on which Parliament has been consulted must be considered in the context of the Global Agreement signed by the European Union and Mexico – the most important agreement the European Union has ever signed, I think it is worth remembering. This is also the context of the interim agreement dealing with the economic and commercial aspects of the Global Agreement, the aim of which was to allow negotiations to begin as soon as possible for the liberalisation of the commercial aspects of Community competence included in the Global Agreement. With regard to the proposal for a decision with which we are concerned and the agreements it deals with, my Group sees them as being very positive because they strengthen the possibility for Community operators to act in spheres of particular interest by guaranteeing them access to the Mexican market on equal or even better terms than those enjoyed by NAFTA countries in the area of services, investments, payments and respect for intellectual property rights, with the resulting benefits and legal guarantee that all this may bring to the European Union. These considerations by themselves would justify the unreserved approval of the proposal for a decision by my Group and, I hope, by this Parliament as well. Furthermore, in addition to the economic advantages, my Group is well aware of the political benefits arising from the adoption of this proposal for a decision, and also that the European Union-Mexico Joint Council, which will meet at the end of this month, needs to adopt it, because only once it is adopted can the provisions on political dialogue and cooperation in the areas of education, combating poverty, and social and environmental matters come into force. My Group in particular and this Parliament in general have always been highly sensitive to such questions, because they are the guarantee that the economic benefits which will undoubtedly accrue from the overall agreement will help promote a political system that is more democratic, more respectful of human rights and more in tune with social justice.

 – Mr President, there is no doubt that the conflict which has been going on in Colombia for more than thirty years cannot be resolved by military means. We agree, Commissioner, that violence can only create more violence. That is why the PPE Group takes a positive view, not only of what strictly constitutes the Colombia Plan to put an end to the production and trafficking in drugs, but also of the concerted efforts of President Pastrana to hold dialogue with the guerrilla movement and his proposed strategy to deal with the problem at its roots and attack its causes, because the objectives of this strategy are to create alternatives which will facilitate the economic and social recovery of Colombia, the resolution of the armed conflict with the guerrilla movement, the strengthening of the democratic institutions, social development and finally the fight against drug trafficking. In fact, unless the violence is not brought to an end through dialogue, unless rural workers are offered alternatives which will enable them to lead dignified lives, unless the serious problem of displaced people is resolved, unless human rights are respected, unless the foundations on which the rule of law is based are strengthened and impunity is brought to an end, unless drug trafficking is brought to an end, peace in Colombia will be nothing more than a fantasy. It therefore seems to us to be essential – and we are delighted about it – that the European Union should support President Pastrana’s peace efforts in the way that the President-in-Office of the Council has just announced and also in the way that the Commission, through Commissioners Patten and Nielson, had announced previously and which it has just reiterated. Thanks to this aid, we are making a contribution to resolving the situations of social justice and to improving the living conditions of the local population, as well as strengthening the democratic institutions. It also seems essential to us that FARC’s leaders return to the negotiating table and that the time period for the peace zone be extended beyond the weekend which President Pastrana has just proposed, so that the peace talks may continue and reach a successful conclusion. But this is also why, since we are determined to find peace and well-being for the people of Colombia, we ask that President Pastrana intensify his fight against the paramilitaries and armed groups which violate human rights and spread pain and death amongst the civil population, and we also ask him to apply the United Nations resolutions on human rights. This is the only way, with the concerted effort of all of us, with a truly intense and decisive fight for peace, that it will be possible for hope to return to the people of Colombia.

Mr President, a number of existing budget lines have proved useful when financing Community action involving cooperation and trade relations within the framework of the various bilateral agreements signed by the European Union and industrialised third countries. Nevertheless, the ever-increasing challenges faced by European companies call for a more clearly defined legal framework and for a single budget line. It would then be possible to develop these operations in a more coherent and coordinated manner and bring added value to the activities undertaken by the Member States. The regulation put forward by the Commission is therefore very timely, and Mrs Mann’s excellent report is even more so. On behalf of my group I would like to congratulate Mrs Mann on her work, thanks to which, the Commission’s proposal is now much more coherent and effective. My group also tabled a number of amendments to this proposal. These were aimed chiefly at making decision-making processes more transparent by involving the European Parliament in the programming and definition of the various subprogrammes to be undertaken in the partner countries. Our amendments were also intended to ensure greater transparency for the activities of those involved, both the European Union and the associated countries, in connection with programmes involving cooperation and commercial relations. In particular, my group has requested the Commission to submit the relevant documentation after decisions have been taken concerning definition of the nature of the objectives of the various programmes and the timetable for invitations to tender. As we see it, this is the only way to improve efficiency and access to these programmes by European citizens and companies. Lastly, I should like to refer with regret to the fact that Parliament was unable to adopt this report – the Mann report – at last December’s part-session. Had the report been adopted the programme could have entered into force quickly, as planned. Let us hope that it will, nevertheless, serve its purpose.

 Commissioner, I think it only fair to thank you for such an exhaustive answer, which to a certain extent reassures me. To the same extent as you are reassured, I think, because there is no doubt that the problems of these numerous refugees in Tanzania are severe. We had the World Food Programme report, which said that food reserves would run out by the end of the year. There is also the need to provide for the training and education of all these refugees, even though they are in an anomalous situation in their lives, precisely so that these years should not be wasted years. Therefore, not only is it essential to give humanitarian food aid, but education programmes and health programmes are also needed so that these tragic years for this people will not be wasted years but can be the starting point for better times and especially for the permanent reconciliation of the Burundian people.

Mr President, the latest annual report by the World Bank highlighted certain figures which were both scandalous in their bleakness and a challenge to the developed world. This report told us how, in fact, poverty and under-development continue to gain ground and that a huge number of people are still unable to exercise their inalienable right to live in dignity. Furthermore, there is the fear that the process of economic globalisation will increase the difficulties of the poorest countries and widen the chasm that separates them from the wealthy countries. Given this situation, there is an inescapable need for greater involvement and greater effectiveness in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment. If the European Union wishes to fully implement its policy of solidarity and finally eradicate poverty and its causes, we must begin to reassess the Union’s actions and the approach it should adopt towards its development aid policy, with a view to improving the effectiveness of those efforts. That is why Mrs Sauquillo’s report and the proposals contained in it are so timely – and I would also like to congratulate her on her work – because they indicate the direction which the European Union should take in responding to the challenges of the twenty-first century in the field of development cooperation. These proposals have been drawn up on the basis of an assessment of the current situation and take account of the obstacles which hinder progress in this field and discuss, in particular, the reform of the Commission’s services: greater competences for delegations and an increase in human resources devoted to development policy, the allocation of financial resources in accordance with the objectives of Community development policy, the simplification of administrative procedures and – of course – the complementarity and coherence of the Union’s development policies. Let us hope that the Commission and the Council are receptive to these proposals and that together we can make speedier progress towards the ultimate eradication of poverty, thereby contributing to the creation of a fairer world.

 Mr President, Commissioner, as you have said so well on many occasions, Parliament, and with it the Group of the European People's Party, has declared itself against the death penalty and in favour of a universal moratorium on capital punishment, the sole objective of which is to achieve the definitive abolition of the death penalty throughout the world. It could not be otherwise, given that this practice, which is directly connected with respect for human life, runs contrary to the defence of human rights, the first of which, the basis and foundation for all the others, is the right to life, which is promoted by the European Union. There comes a time, however, when words are not enough and a far more aggressive attitude must be adopted in defence of what, for the Christian Democrats, constitutes the very core of our philosophy and our political action: the transcendental value of the person and the right to life from the moment of conception until their natural death; two principles which are incompatible with the application of the death penalty. Therefore, we are not only advocating its abolition, but also proposing the possibility of using budget lines intended for human rights to campaign in favour of a moratorium on the death penalty, and that non-governmental organisations, both international and local, and religious authorities may also participate in the implementation of these budget lines. And we propose this, first of all, because human rights and the abolition of the death penalty constitute a whole and because this enables us to move from words to action, and because the participation of civil society is essential to creating a mindset and a collective awareness in favour of abolishing the death penalty. It is clear that there is a tendency in favour of abolishing the death penalty. We need only look at the statistics. Nonetheless, it is still applied in 90 States and we cannot turn a blind eye to the 1,625 known executions carried out in 1998, 80% of which took place in just four countries, including, in third place, the United States of America with 68 executions. Therefore, together with respect for human rights, the abolition of the death penalty must be a key element, Commissioner, in relations between the European Union and third countries. This is particularly so in the case of the United States due to the contradiction inherent in championing freedom throughout the world and having the power of life or death over its citizens, be it in order to set an example or because a majority of citizens requests it. Democracy cannot subject everything to the law of numbers as no action affecting the fundamental rights of the person, the first and foremost of which is the right to life, can be undertaken or justified in the name of the majority. If the death penalty – as the community of San Egidio told us – dehumanises our world by giving primacy to reprisals and revenge, then placing all measures, both economic and political, within our reach in order to banish a practice that is contrary to the principles and values that constitute our raison d'être should be a priority objective for the European Union. We are therefore pleased that the Commission has adopted this objective and that it is being treated with the degree of gravity that the Commissioner told us this fundamental issue deserves, so that we might be in harmony with the principles we are defending. (Applause)

Mr President, in the increasingly open economic climate in which the European Union must operate, and given the need to establish trade relations that ensure the competitiveness of undertakings, it is crucial that we establish a legal framework that sets the same rules of play for everyone. In this sense, the Community Customs Code is an essential support for the European Union’s trade policy, as well, as we are already aware, as being an essential instrument for protecting the Union’s financial interests. The progress made on the internal market, the gradual growth in trade due to the increasing opening up of the markets and the progress of the information society mean that the Community Customs Code needs to be brought up to date with the development of Community and international trade. Hence the need for and the timeliness of the reform that was proposed at the time with the aim of simplifying and rationalising customs procedures, precisely in response to the demands of the new realities that I have mentioned. On the other hand, it was also necessary, as I understood it, to establish effective monitoring measures to ensure the uniform application of customs procedures across the whole of the Community and to prevent unfair competition and the opening up of loopholes that could facilitate fraud. At the time Parliament therefore introduced some amendments with the aim, on the one hand, of guaranteeing the possibility of conducting customs procedures by means of computerised declarations, but without this unwittingly opening up the back door to fraud. On the other hand, the aim was to ensure that customs rules were applied correctly and consistently across the whole of the Community, in order to prevent situations of unfair competition. As the rapporteur pointed out, however, neither the Council nor the Commission adopted the specific amendments that I have mentioned, because, among other reasons, they considered that they did not add anything to the proposed text and that fraud should be combated outside the Community Customs Code. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as the rapporteur pointed out, accepted that approach, and therefore decided not to re-introduce the amendments. I personally continue to believe, however, that the text that was adopted by Parliament at the time responded much better to the new realities that had arisen from the internal market and the liberalisation of the markets, insofar as the elements of clarification and monitoring that were introduced by the amendments that were not adopted were a better guarantee that the rules would be complied with and that the same procedures would be followed when applying them. I must therefore regret that they were not taken into consideration, although I also understand the position of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market – the position of the rapporteur – of not re-introducing the amendments because, ultimately, what really matters is that the Community Customs Code and the proposed reforms move forward and that the legal framework is established. Let us hope that in the future we will at least be able to achieve those guarantees.

In the current context and given that we are beginning to hear enlargement being questioned in certain quarters, it is important that this Parliament sends a clear political signal in support of it. That is why I have voted in favour of the Brok report. This is an excellent report which, as well as analysing the progress made and the difficulties still facing the countries with which negotiations have begun, also serves as a reminder to the public of the political and ethical commitment which the European Union, this Parliament, has made, not only to the candidate countries which wish to share our European history, and have the right to do so, but also to the political project of European integration itself. I believe that enlargement will not only favour the prosperity and economic growth of the candidate countries and, by extension, that of the current Member States of the Union, but will, above all, also provide a guarantee of peace and stability in Europe and thereby offer the European Union the opportunity to finish the task of ensuring peace in Europe, which began fifty years ago. We must remind those people who have no sense of solidarity and are concerned about the economic cost of enlargement, that the prize of peace fully justifies this cost.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the increase in poverty, despite the gradual growth of world GDP over recent decades, the current tendency of Member States to reduce the funds intended for official aid to development in favour of direct investment, of which only 1% goes to the least-developed countries – which increases the gulf which separates those countries from the rich or developing countries – and the conviction that the globalisation process may increase the difficulties of the poor countries, are all factors which demonstrate the urgent need to improve the effectiveness of policies on development cooperation. In the field of democracy and respect for human rights we are also very far from the desirable parameters: coups d’états, violence, wars and violations of human rights are still realities in the least-developed countries. We must therefore contribute to correcting this situation. In this context, it is essential to strengthen the complementarity of policies on development cooperation implemented by the Community and the Member States. Firstly, because complementarity enables us to take advantage of the synergy resulting from a coordinated approach in the actions to be implemented, not only by the European Union but also by all the international donors, which will improve the impact of those actions. Secondly, because it contributes an element of added value to the Member States’ interventions, which will help to optimise the resources destined for development aid and to achieve better results. Thirdly, because it would improve the visibility of the European Union and make its development policy more credible, which will allow it to exert the political influence it deserves as the main provider of funds – let us remember that between half and two thirds of development aid comes from the European Union – and both the NGOs and the recipient countries would like this influence to be greater given that nobody is more sensitive than the European Union in the field of social justice and human development. Lastly, improving complementarity is important because the Treaty on European Union clearly establishes that the Member States and the Community must coordinate their policies on development cooperation and harmonise their aid programmes. That is why we must take a positive view of the Commission’s presentation of the communication on the complementarity of Community and Member States’ policies on development cooperation, since the measures it proposes may contribute to removing the obstacles which hinder significant advances in this area. In general terms, it can be said that the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and myself, are in agreement on the broad approach of the document and on the measures it proposes. Nevertheless, I would like to make some specific points. The first is that I consider that the Commission should have taken account of the fact that complementarity is not an isolated element, but should rather be dealt with within a context of a global strategy which also addresses the issues of coordination and coherence, since coherence is inseparable from coordination and complementarity, and, without coordination, complementarity is not possible. Therefore, I believe that, in order to really improve the impact of European development policies and safeguard the credibility of the Union, it would have been much more appropriate and would have made things much clearer if these aspects had been tackled jointly within the framework of the communication on development policy, since that would have better highlighted the essential and inseparable nature of these elements in relation to the formulation of a development policy in accordance with the Union’s objectives. My second point relates to the very concept of complementarity, which must not be viewed as a protective principle for preserving the competences of the Member States in this field, but as a manifestation of a political will to unite our efforts to improve and contribute more effectively to implementing the objectives of our policies on development cooperation. Furthermore, the need to ensure the unity, coherence and effectiveness of Union action in the field of external policy – which is also laid down in the Treaty – must extend to development policies, since these are an integral part of the Union’s external action. The Commission should therefore take the initiative and make a qualitative leap in that direction in order to allow the European Union to establish its strategic priorities in the field of development aid. Thirdly, I must say that it will be difficult for measures to strengthen complementarity, alone, to achieve the desired results. For that, the political will of the Council must, as a precondition, make progress towards greater integration in the field of cooperation, because what has hindered the progress of complementarity has been above all the fact that the Member States define their development cooperation policies more in accordance with their geo-strategic economic interests and their colonial pasts than with the objectives of the Union in relation to development. Lastly, we should repeat that, as well as the operative measures to improve the management of programmes, with which – as I have said – the Committee on Development and Cooperation is in agreement in principle, we believe that the Commission should take the responsibility for reflecting and making proposals, which is an essential requirement if the Union wants to direct aid not only towards promoting the economic growth of the beneficiary countries but also so that that growth will reach all sections of the population, thereby fulfilling its commitment to the development of peoples and, therefore, its commitment to peace, since, without development, peace will always be difficult to attain. In any event, and to sum up, I would like to reiterate the timeliness of this communication – even though we would have liked it to have been part of a global package – and say how fitting the measures are and that, together with the measures also proposed by the Committee on Development and Cooperation in my report, we hope that they will help to guide our action, providing better operational management. I should repeat once again that the Council must show signs of political will, without which it will be very difficult to make the principle of complementarity a reality.

Mr President, unfortunately, kidnappings in Sierra Leone are once again in the news. This time it is the kidnapping of eleven British soldiers by the West Side Boys militia. To this we must add the attacks carried out by this group of rebels with the aim of extending their area of influence, which have cost the lives of three members of the pro-governmental forces. These are actions that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats strongly condemns and which the European Parliament should also condemn. At the same time, it should also demand the immediate and unconditional release of the soldiers who are being held hostage and show its support for the Government of Sierra Leone, and for the UNAMSIL and British army forces who are working to consolidate peace in that country. It is still a precarious peace, which is demonstrated by this kidnapping. That is why we cannot just stop at words of condemnation, but we must move on to action and also demand that the Lomé Peace Agreements are complied with and that all the militias are disarmed. However, as long as poverty continues to rule in Sierra Leone, until the trafficking of diamonds is put to an end once and for all and the arms trade is ended, there will be no chance of peace for this tortured country. The European Union must therefore use every means within its power, not only in order to help fund the peace process, but also, above all, in order to make it possible to establish living conditions that make peace irreversible. We therefore need a generous and coordinated policy of development cooperation, especially in the field of education. This is why a budgetary effort is being requested for this policy, as a policy that will contribute to ending the blight of poverty. But, above all, we need decisive action on the part of the European Union, the Member States and the whole of the international community in order to put an end to diamond trafficking in the area. As long as a country’s natural wealth is only benefiting warlords, that is, as long as diamonds enable the paramilitaries to have sufficient capital to provide themselves with arms and continue their activities, peace will be nothing more than an impossible dream. Without peace, development will only be a Utopia.
Ferrer (PPE-DE

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I truly regret your reply. I believe that the problem relating to the trafficking in diamonds, which has cost, and is costing, many lives, deserves much more decisive and firm attention from the Council. I clearly cannot blame you for this, since you have just taken over the Presidency, but I would ask you to adopt much more energetic and forceful decisions. The European Union is committed to promoting peace and stability, not only in Europe, but throughout the world. If diamonds are not controlled it is clear that peace and stability in Africa cannot be promoted. In the case of Sierra Leone, Great Britain had supported the embargo, and France as well, to a certain extent. The Council could promote a generalised embargo of all diamonds originating in Africa and, above all, the control of certificates. We know these measures would be difficult to implement but, in any event, any advance in this respect would save human lives and contribute to the pacification of truly dramatic conflicts in Africa.

Commissioner, in your speech you told us how you viewed the situation, but I can assure you that the industry does not see it in the same way. It is true that aid was adopted in the past to tackle great difficulties facing the industry, but the problem is that today, ten years later and through no fault of the producers, the circumstances that led to the approval of that aid have not changed. As has been pointed out, our tariffs continue to be very low, European products are still unable to compete with those originating above all from Turkey and the United States, as a result of social and labour costs or because the crops, in the case of the United States, are in irrigable areas and are mechanisable while those in the European Union are in drought areas which are not easily accessible, where there is little chance of mechanisation, and it is therefore true that they are less competitive. However, this does not make the production in the European Union any less important. Furthermore, despite the importance of this production, we still have a deficit, and the disappearance of this crop – which may occur if the aid to the industry is not continued – would put the consumer in the hands of Turkey and the United States, who would set our prices from their position as a true monopoly. We should also remember, Commissioner, that there is practically no alternative to the cultivation of nuts because of the places in which they are produced. For all these reasons, it is not surprising that there is enormous concern in the sector at the possibility that aid may be withdrawn, since without it – and we must recognise this –, given that the future of these operations, as a result of the competition from third countries, is in jeopardy and the investment made in the modernisation of the production systems – which has taken place on a significant scale – will have been pointless. I would therefore also like to ask you, Commissioner, on behalf of the producers in the sector and especially on behalf of the producers in Catalonia, for the specific aid to this sector to be continued in the way that has been pointed out here and along the lines of the motion for a resolution which I hope will receive the support of this House. This aid only represents 0.18% of the total budget of the EAGGF-Guarantee and 0.16% of the total agricultural budget, for which, furthermore, it has been pointed out that there is a sufficient financial margin. Any other type of aid such as those you have mentioned, above all rural development aid, may be positive in other sectors, it is true, but in this case, given the specific nature of the sector, they are totally insufficient to guarantee the competitiveness, and therefore the survival, of these operations, whose interests the Commission – you, Commissioner – can in no way ignore.

The recognition of women’s rights as an integral and indivisible component of universal human rights requires the adoption of accompanying measures which will allow this recognition to be transposed into concrete actions. It also requires a subsequent evaluation of those measures, above all, so that they can be adapted in the event that they are not sufficiently effective. This is why the Smet-Gröner report, and the proposals contained in it, are so opportune and correct. I have therefore voted in favour of it. Of particular importance is the request for specific preventive measures and measures to promote women’s health and guarantee their right to genetic health, as long as this right is not understood to mean the right to abortion but rather the right to the protection of the health of the expectant mother and the unborn child. With regard to the promotion of equal opportunities in the context of policies on cooperation with development, I would like to point out that, in my view, efforts in this area should concentrate especially on guaranteeing girls’ access to primary education, which means at the same time ensuring that it is free. However, I regret the fact that the amendment that I presented on behalf of the PPE has not been accepted. The prevention of adolescent pregnancies demands, above all, that we educate the young in the values which stem from their essential sense of self-worth and teach them to enjoy their freedom in a responsible manner.

Mr President, given the threats once again faced by the people of Sierra Leone, when they still have vivid memories of the horror and barbarity they have suffered at the hands of the RUF, we cannot content ourselves with simply condemning the events which are recurring. Let us remember that amongst the objectives of the common foreign policy are the maintenance of peace and the respect for human rights, principles which are being totally disregarded today in Sierra Leone. This Parliament must therefore urge the Member States to support the call of the Secretary-General of the United Nations so that the deployment of a rapid intervention force may proceed in order to re-establish stability in Sierra Leone and thereby contribute to preventing the danger of a new civil war which today hangs over that country. However, our commitment must not end with this call. We must also fight for an end to the impunity with which acts of genocide and war crimes have been carried out and for the people responsible for them to be brought before the Tribunals so that they may be judged. We must also eradicate the cancer which has given rise to the destabilisation of that country. That is why this Parliament must urge the OAU, the European Union, the Commission and the Government of Sierra Leone to adopt and promote whatever measures are necessary to end diamond trafficking and the control of that country’s abundant natural resources by those people who, thanks to diamonds, have become men of war. We are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Schuman declaration. The best tribute we could pay to those people who, through that declaration, sowed the seed which has borne such abundant fruit in terms of peace and well-being, would be to commit ourselves to the cause of that beleaguered country, to decisively help the people of Sierra Leone to re-establish peace and, through peace, the full respect for human rights and the possibility of economic development which will lead it out of poverty and allow it finally to live in dignity.

Mr President, the calling of municipal elections by President Obiang should constitute a step forward on the path to democratisation in that country and, therefore, we should take a positive of view of it. Even more so if we bear in mind that the President of Guinea is one of the signatories of the Cairo declaration and the action plan which accompanies it, which recognises the need to consolidate democratic principles, based on the right of all citizens to choose their leaders freely by means of free elections and, consequently, also the need to ensure that elections are transparent and free, and to adopt the necessary means for their effective observation. However, the experience of previous elections, during which serious irregularities and a total lack of transparency were noted, as well the continuing lack of democratic guarantees in Guinea, requires not only that we observe very carefully how the coming elections are held, but also that we demand, forcefully, that President Obiang adopts the necessary measures to guarantee fair play in these elections. We especially have to ensure that the process is open to all political forces – which involves the liberation of the political prisoners – and that the opposition is guaranteed the full expression of its democratic freedoms. We should also demand the presence of observers who can monitor, in total freedom, the handling of these elections, and verify that democratic rights have been respected. These elections may offer Guinea the opportunity to start along the path to democracy. They could also lead to a rapprochement with the European Union and the granting of the aid which the European Union was prepared to give in the event that democracy was respected. Therefore, as a Parliament, we have the obligation to exert pressure on President Obiang and demand that he allows these elections to be held in accordance with democratic principles. This is the only way that freedom may be fully restored to the people of Guinea. (Applause)

The process of enlargement which the European Union has started has brought it to a crossroads and its ability to continue making progress will depend on the direction it takes. It can therefore be said that the IGC, which is charged with proceeding with the institutional reforms which will make enlargement possible, holds the future of the European Union in its hands, since it has to decide between the minimal reform laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the broad reform which will allow the Union to accept the countries which are preparing for accession and pursue its task in favour of respect for human rights, peace and social justice. Therefore, given that we are at a crucial moment in the process of European integration, it was appropriate for Parliament to send a message indicating what it understood to be the key points of the reform. In the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report which we have just approved and which I have voted in favour of, Parliament indicates that we have to make further progress and that, to this end, we have to give the European Union the necessary means to complete the shared project of peace and well-being initiated 50 years ago. Let us hope that the IGC is aiming sufficiently high for the great challenges facing the Union and that it follows that path which Parliament has set for it.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the debate I am opening under the very long title you have just announced represents the final phase of Parliament’s work, carried out in close contact with the Commission, to strengthen relations with Mexico on the basis of the principles and values which underpin our democratic system. In May 1999 Parliament gave its assent to an Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement, signed in 1997 between the European Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and Mexico, on the other. Once it has been ratified by all the Member States, it will replace the cooperation agreement signed between the Community and Mexico in 1991. In May 1998 Parliament gave its assent to a provisional interim agreement on trade and related issues associated with the 1997 agreement. The aim was to enable negotiations on liberalising the trade aspects of the global agreement falling within the Community’s competence to begin as soon as possible, without having to wait for ratification by the fifteen Member States to be completed. Now that these negotiations have been concluded and the Council has expressed its view on their content, it falls to Parliament, in response to the Council’s formal consultation, to give its opinion on the results of the negotiations. Here I want to thank the Commission for making this consultation by the Council possible in close cooperation with Parliament – I am delighted about that and I hope it will set a precedent. However, I am sorry it did not adopt the commitment of the previous Commission to keep us informed of the progress of the negotiations, given the importance of the issues involved. Turning to the substance of my report, the first thing I want to highlight is that, although we are dealing with an implementation agreement exclusively concerned with trade, there is a political dimension to bear in mind in expressing our opinion. This is the case because the text my report covers is set in the context of the Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement, and that agreement is a reflection of the will to promote a genuinely democratic political system, respect for human, social and environmental rights and a fairer social balance, thanks to the greater economic development the liberalisation of trade will generate. In fact, Article 1 of that agreement makes respect for democratic principles and human rights, in the widest sense, an essential factor and the very foundation of the agreement. Again, the inclusion of a clause on fulfilment of obligations, providing for the agreement to be suspended in case of failure to meet the obligations laid down in Article 1, also guarantees the commitment of the parties to democracy and respect for fundamental rights. In addition, by institutionalising cooperation between the European Union and Mexico, especially on human rights issues, social affairs and the fight against poverty, an instrument is being created which could be extremely useful for reducing the social inequalities which persist in Mexico and for improving the living conditions of the less advantaged strata of the population. My second point, relating to the content of the negotiations on the implementation of Articles 3, 4, 5, 6 and 12 of the interim agreement, covering trade in goods, public procurement, competition, the consultation mechanism for questions relating to intellectual property and dispute settlement, is to highlight the fact that this package of measures represents a good agreement. Although for certain sectors there may be flaws – I am thinking specifically of the textiles sector, where the rules of origin issue causes great concern – the effects will be beneficial for both the European Union and Mexico. For the European Union, because the establishment of a free trade area will enable it to rebuild the presence Member States had in Mexican markets before the NAFTA agreement came into force, involving new expansion opportunities for European companies. For Mexico, because it will be able to diversify and introduce balance into its external trade, currently 80% dependent on its NAFTA partners, and at the same time increase the volume of its exports to the European Union, with the consequent favourable impact this increase will have on the Mexican economy. Of course, during the transition period, and until all products have been fully liberalised, the agreement will be more beneficial to Mexico than the European Union, but this asymmetry also takes account of the levels of development and competitiveness of the European economy as compared with Mexico’s. All the same, in spite of this asymmetry, Community producers will clearly be in a much better position to compete in the Mexican market than they have been up to now. For all these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, and by a very large majority, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy recommends a vote in favour of the Council Decision on the result of negotiations whose benefits we must monitor to make sure they genuinely contribute to promoting a more democratic political system and respect for human rights and social justice.

Commissioner, thank you for giving me a well-intentioned answer, which has been rigorous and well-argued. However, I can assure you that we do not, with the existing measures – which you have referred to – reach these severely less-favoured regions. They are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation, where almost none exists. Therefore, my question is whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policies on microcredits, which have brought results in cooperation, could be applied to those women in severely less-favoured regions, who have the odds stacked against them. I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to. I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need. With these forecasts of the structural policy – which I know very well – and the forecasts of LEADER and rural development, we will not promote, as we should, employment amongst women in the severely less-favoured regions. I would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying microcredit policies.

Strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises and favouring measures which will contribute to improving their competitiveness has been one of the objectives of this Parliament, because of the fundamental role they play in the creation of jobs and because any actions aimed at small and medium-sized economic operators promote European economic growth in general and provide a safe path towards achieving economic and social cohesion in the Community. The proposal for a directive combating late payments in commercial transactions is, in this sense, an effective instrument in terms of ending the excessive and often abusive time limits for payment which are used in certain fundamental sectors and which are the main cause of bankruptcy and financial and investment difficulties which SMEs have to face. This is why I have a very positive view of the Murphy report and have voted in favour of it, since it reintroduces aspects which the Council had eliminated in drawing up the common position, but which are of unquestionable benefit to SMEs, in particular the obligation to legislate for the establishment of standardised payment terms in commercial transactions and for this obligation to also be incumbent upon public entities. Let us hope that the Council listens to Parliament and that we can at last lay down harmonised contract rules at a European level, which will put an end to late payment and the dominant position of some creditors with regard to payment terms, and thereby improve the competitiveness of SMEs.

Mr President, after eight years – as we have been reminded – of a bloody civil war, the peace agreement signed on 7 July of this year provided the opportunity to end this tragic period and resolve, in a peaceful and lasting way, a conflict which has caused immense suffering to the population. Nevertheless, the hopes which gave rise to this agreement have not been fulfilled and today, five months later, we must note with great concern and sorrow that the rebel attacks against civilians, the killings and rapes, have not only failed to diminish, but have actually increased. Therefore, we Christian Democrats, who have always defended the use of dialogue and reconciliation, wish to repeat our complete condemnation of the acts of violence and violations of human rights which are still being carried out and deplore the delay in the development of the peace process. However, above all, we wish to call on the parties in the conflict to abandon arms for good and respect the commitments contained in the agreement. Since words are not enough, however, and actions are required, we earnestly request that measures be adopted and means provided that will allow compliance with the agreement. In particular, the Security Council of the United Nations must decide to go ahead with the deployment of international peacekeeping forces. Also, the necessary funds must be provided so that the agreement may be put into effect; particularly – and this has already been mentioned – with regard to the promotion of development and education, of all those measures which will finally allow the population of Sierra Leone to come together and live in peace, freedom and democracy.

Mr President, we are living through an era full of contrasts and contradictions and while, in the European Union, women’s rights are fully recognised, in some countries they are even denied the right to be, the very right to exist. While this morning a Member pointed out the fact that the three institutions of the European Union responsible for signing the budget were presided over by women and saw this as an illustration of what the third millennium may represent for the consolidation of equality of rights and opportunities for men and women, in Afghanistan we see how the Taliban regime not only denies women – millions of women – their most basic rights – such as rights to education, healthcare and a profession, not only does it commit violence against them for the mere fact of being women but, through the denial of these rights, it is also denying them the freedom to live their own lives, it is denying them their status as human beings. The European Parliament, which is always sensitive to the cause of human rights, cannot remain inactive in the face of the greatest violation of these rights: the systematic discrimination and violence which women are today suffering in Afghanistan of which the public execution of Zaarmeena is just one tragic example. Therefore, once again, we want to roundly condemn the Taliban regime. We want to demand that the international community, in particular the United Nations, but also the European Union and its Member States, intervenes with all the means available to it, to put an end to the extreme discrimination suffered by Afghan women. And, above all, we want to send evidence of our solidarity with the women of Afghanistan and communicate to them our commitment to continue working with them so that they may regain their full dignity as human beings.

Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that the need to develop trade as effectively as possible and the new challenges posed by globalisation, as well as the need to consolidate a balanced commercial system which will contribute to sustainable development and whose benefits will also extend to the less developed countries, require a strengthening of the rules which govern international trade. Hence the importance of the coming conference in Seattle and the timeliness and suitability of the proposals in the Commission’s communication as regards the upcoming negotiations. In fact, given the challenges before us, it is clear that the next Round cannot be limited to simply widening the regulatory framework, however important that may be, nor must it only ensure that trade liberalisation contributes to economic and social growth in the less developed countries, although I share fully in that desire. Rather, it must also establish rules which will lead to the opening up of markets and guarantee compliance with them. We have to bear in mind that for European industry – and I am thinking in particular of the textile sector – access to the markets of the developed countries and emerging economies on reciprocal terms is a fundamental priority. To this end it is essential that the Commission achieves the harmonisation of tariffs and the elimination of tariff peaks and tariff progression, as well as the removal of all technical barriers to trade, on the understanding that the less developed countries should be guaranteed free access to the international market for all their products so that they can also benefit from trade liberalisation. And now, Commissioner, I would like to ask you firstly if you can confirm your intention not to accept, on the agenda of the negotiations, any reconsideration of the agreement on the textile sector as regards the clothing industry and, secondly, how you consider that China’s membership of the World Trade Organisation will affect the European textile industry, bearing in mind that that country is the world’s foremost exporter of textile products. Finally, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report and his desire to reach the widest possible consensus on a subject as important as the coming Millennium Round, which we depend on to consolidate a balanced trading system which will ensure, on a global level, an economic order based on social justice.

I have given my positive vote to the Commission presided over by Mr Prodi, firstly, because the President clearly has the characteristics required to meet the challenges which the European Union must face on the threshold of the third millennium, and because, in general, the Commissioners have given evidence of their ability to respond to those challenges in an effective way. It is not simply a matter of ensuring, within the framework of economic globalisation, a degree of growth which is capable of creating lasting and sustainable employment, or proposing profound institutional reform at the next Intergovernmental Conference. Nor is it just a matter of going forward with the issue of enlargement of the Union in order to contribute to the well-being of Europe as a whole, despite the undeniable importance of these challenges. What is needed, above all, is the advancement of the process of European construction with regard to feelings and conscience. It is a matter, as Prodi said himself yesterday, of creating one soul and one heart: the European heart and soul. It is also a question of offering genuine peace and prosperity to the neighbouring populations and establishing links of co-operation on a global level in order to create a decent society for all, a world which enjoys peace and liberty. Mr Prodi, both through his loyalty to the principles which brought about the current European Union and through his proven capacity for management, will, I am sure, lead the new Commission along the path and at the pace which current circumstances require. Therefore, in spite of individual questions which concern certain Commissioners which, in any case, belong to the past, I have given my vote of confidence to the new Commission in the knowledge, furthermore, that Parliament has the necessary mechanisms in place to withdraw that confidence in the event that it is betrayed. The restoration of the hope and confidence of the European citizens now depends on the Commission which, under the direction of President Prodi, today embarks on its course. This Commission has been granted, by this Parliament, the democratic legitimacy and transparency which the citizens demand.

Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, repairing the dramatic material and, above all, moral consequences of the Kosovo drama, collaborating with the International Criminal Court so that the crimes committed do not go unpunished, laying down the foundations for the economic development of the area so as to promote reconciliation between the Kosovan Albanian and Serbian populations, must be matters of the utmost priority for the European Union. Another priority must be the promotion of enlargement in order to safeguard the peace and political stability of the continent. To this end I have heard, Madam President, with satisfaction, that both issues are political priorities of the Presidency, together with the creation of a catalogue of human rights. I was also satisfied to hear, passing on to other matters, although no less important, of its concern about the creation of jobs and improvements in the well-being of our citizens. In the global world of today, job-creation measures, in order to be genuinely effective, must be adopted within a global framework. Hence the need for this Presidency to pay particular attention also to the preparation of the next Millennium round. Not only to continue with the deregulation of world trade, but also to provide instruments with which to fight fraud and dishonest commercial practices and to guarantee reciprocal compliance with the regulations governing international trade to achieve the simplification and generalisation of customs procedures under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation, in order, in a word, that the opening up of markets may constitute a genuine opportunity which will create jobs and contribute to the well-being of the citizens of the European Union.
