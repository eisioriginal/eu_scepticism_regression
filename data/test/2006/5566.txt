Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all agreed that a renewed commitment is needed against the proliferation of thermonuclear weapons, as Mr Schulz said in his speech, but at the same time we need to start saying more clearly that it is not enough to prevent proliferation, but we must start fighting once again for universal disarmament. In truth, there will never be a true planetary democracy if some countries can dominate the world because they have the power to destroy it several times over. In fact, the countries in the nuclear club, and in particular, today, the United Kingdom and France, will have the authority and the moral right to prevent proliferation by other countries if they themselves begin to disarm and if they place on the agenda a ban on all weapons of mass destruction. Unfortunately, this is not the course which is being pursued, if we look at the unilateral policy adopted by the United States of America – a policy which also runs counter to NATO. The United States has secretly negotiated with some European countries to host US anti-missile programmes, and we have tabled a specific amendment against this. We must, therefore, block these plans, saying ‘No’ to proliferation but ‘Yes’ to a European initiative designed to achieve universal disarmament.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this legislative proposal on the European private company statute is very important. It is, in fact, crucial not only to remove barriers to trade but also to develop the factor of production at Community level. To that end, there is undoubtedly a need to create unitary legal entities in order to overcome the current legal uncertainty. It should not be forgotten, however, that, as well as trying to make markets transparent and to protect savers, the company law reform will also directly affect the future of the European social model. Therefore, if allowing companies to move wherever they like in order to take advantage of the single market is a legitimate aim, it must be fulfilled by giving our workers the same transnational rights. That was the thinking behind some of my amendments, certain of which were accepted, which were aimed at safeguarding the rights to codetermination, information and consultation that exist at the time of a company’s turning into a European private company. We are talking here about an important adjustment that will mean more careful attention being paid to aspects relating to the strengthening of social Europe, one of the fundamental elements of which must be worker participation. We therefore endorse this important proposal and we thank Mr Lehne for his work. We would point out to the Commission that, if allowing companies to move wherever they like in order to take advantage of the single market is a legitimate aim, it must be fulfilled without the demands of the market prejudicing those of social equality.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wholeheartedly supports this draft resolution, because it sees it as a decisive step in the strategy to oppose the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction that was adopted by Europe in December 2003, and also because it makes reducing the biological weapons threat a top priority. At the same time, another important initiative is that we are calling on all countries that have not yet done so to abide by the legislation banning biological weapons, not least in order to achieve that universality that is an integral and binding part of international law. Within this basic framework, there are in any case measures designed to ensure that the Convention is effectively implemented, although in the most recent analysis the United States failed to comply with these measures. I should also like to stress the importance of the appeal made in the resolution to finalise a specific Protocol 6 unequivocally banning the manufacture and use of cluster bombs, despicable weapons even used in humanitarian wars to get round the Mine Ban Convention. At the same time, Europe needs to show that there is a direct link between trends towards proliferation, which must be strenuously repressed, and the failure to disarm. The West will have greater moral authority to oppose the proliferation of any kind of weapon if: 1) the United States stops opposing the adoption of inspection measures and the banning of cluster bombs; and 2) the disarmament process is resumed even within the nuclear club. What has happened today is therefore an important step, but it is merely the first on the long road towards a ban on all weapons of mass destruction.

Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I believe, Mr Barroso, that, during next Friday's Summit, you must go against what was claimed in Klosterneuburg and argue that the problem is not one of extending the period of reflection on the institutional issue, but rather of making swift progress both in improving and ratifying the European Constitution and regarding policies capable of improving Europe’s image among Europeans. In fact, if the two countries that failed to ratify the Constitution did so for reasons quite different to those regarding the constitutional text, then it is really a question of moving more quickly on practical policies capable of changing Europe’s image for the better. In order to do this, however, we need to go beyond the period of reflection on the institutional issue as quickly as possible.  The constraints that we come up against in implementing the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world are, in fact, mainly due to the intergovernmental, rather than Community, approach. There can be no single currency without common economic and social policies and without a genuine form of socio-economic governance.  We must therefore clearly state that social and economic problems are resolved by a form of institution building that is in keeping with the Community approach. If we do not want to destroy Europe, then we must state, as Mr Schulz did, that Europe needs the Constitution immediately.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about a loss of more than 500 lives: the greatest tragedy at sea since the Second World War. The numbers are shocking, and yet Europe and its governments seem distracted. Some countries, including Italy, thought they had protected themselves by signing bilateral agreements such as the recent treaty with Libya; that is not so. The agreement in question brings together very diverse issues, such as the recognition of crimes perpetrated during the colonial era, with promises of investment, in exchange for commitments to control migration. Today, it seems the very mirage of Italian investments in Libya is attracting thousands of young people from West Africa. It is easy to predict that if the promised USD 5 billion does not arrive, then it is people who will arrive. What can we say then about French interests in Niger, linked to the stockpiling of uranium, which is stirring up a war among the Tuareg and thus favouring the people traffickers? What is more, all this is taking place in broad daylight, documented by journalists. What this means is that certain European governments are playing with fire. If all this does not change, and fast, if Europe does not decide to act with positive policies in keeping with our values, it will not be enough to mute the news as we are doing at present. The Mediterranean is becoming a mass grave, far from the rhetorical images that describe it. Let us remember though that this sea is linked to the fate of Europe itself.

 Madam President, Mrs Ferrero­Waldner, Mr Vondra, ladies and gentlemen, with this report, Parliament is proposing to make a constructive contribution to the prospect of strengthening the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. The proposals resulting from the Paris summit on 14 July last year put forward two objectives that are worthy of our support. The first of these is to give practical shape to economic, regional and environmental integration projects and to make them more effective, by creating a secretariat entrusted with this task, receiving public and private funding; the second is to strengthen political dialogue within the whole process, through new institutions such as the co-presidency, the summit of Heads of State or Government and the regular Foreign Ministers meetings. In this context, I would like to emphasise the role of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which was recognised in the Paris text and then in the Marseille document. Parliament wants to help find a way out of the serious stalemate that has followed the tragic events in Gaza. Much depends, however, on the policies that the new Israeli Government formed after the elections will adopt. Nonetheless, I would like to point out that the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly will meet in the near future and demonstrate the role that parliaments have to play, even in this difficult situation. We wish to highlight the value of institutions that involve both the European Union and the countries in the south and east of the Mediterranean while, at the same time, signalling that it is essential not to reduce the entire process to a solely intergovernmental approach. We hope for widespread involvement of civil society and social partners, not least because the economic crisis can worsen the already endemic and terrible problems such as unemployment and increasing migratory pressure, making this phenomenon even more difficult to manage. We are calling for greater attention to be paid to the issues of human rights that affect the behaviour of all the partner countries to a greater or lesser degree. As regards the institutions, let us remember that with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union may be assured of coherent and structured representation through the new figures of the President of the Council and the European Foreign Minister. In the meantime, it would be beneficial to ensure continuity in the European presence, at least in the co-presidency. We know that the Czech Presidency has been sensitive to this, and hope that the Swedish Presidency, too, will be willing to accept this message. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all my fellow Members and the officials of the various political groups and committees that have given their opinion. They have all contributed to the drafting of this report, which I believe enjoys widespread support.

 Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Vondra, ladies and gentlemen, I think this debate has been very useful and has clarified certain aspects of our fairly complicated system of instruments for bilateral and multilateral partnership with the countries of the south. I subscribe to the explanation Mrs Ferrero-Waldner gave, pointing out that the Barcelona acquis
 remains in place, and that for precisely this reason, we in Parliament would perhaps have preferred the first definition, which was: ‘The Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean’. Perhaps it would then have been clearer that we were reinforcing a system for which there was already an established basis. Similarly, I hope – I say so quite openly, I will no longer be rapporteur – but I hope that Europe’s institutional framework can itself evolve. Why? Because once we have a European Foreign Minister who will, in part, represent the Commission and the Council, I hope that this minister will not be a 28th 
foreign minister to add to all the others but, at least on the European side, the Member States will feel that they are represented by this person. There will then perhaps be no need to add more states to the Union, but if we have a senior representative in the Foreign Minister, we may be able to consolidate the role of the European Union. This is something we have all worked towards, and so we give our wholehearted support not only to the fact that the regional programmes should continue but also, as the Commissioner knows, that Parliament attaches great importance to these programmes, which have arguably produced better results. Thank you all for this debate.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the face of this vast tragedy our words are liable to be inadequate. An army that kills hundreds of civilians, women and children, places itself at the same level as the terrorism that it is claiming to combat. On the other hand, anyone who knows Gaza, even if only through having seen it on the map, knows that no military operation could be conceived without admitting the likelihood of a massacre of civilians. Can Israel today say that it is safer, after having given rise to so much hatred and despair? If not with Hamas, directly or indirectly, then with whom must a way out of the blind violence be sought? Our resolution reinforces the call for a cease-fire already expressed by the United Nations Security Council. We urge the parties to abide by it and we call upon Europe to take action to render it possible. The risk is that this massacre, far from vanquishing Hamas, Mr Brok, will weaken the Palestinian Authority itself even further, as well as those in the Palestinian world who have staked everything on negotiations with Israel. We should ask ourselves, honestly, what have they actually gained so far? Nothing. That is the answer that we must give if we truly wish to start rooting out the hatred and the violence.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteurs who have spoken before me have given a good explanation of the purpose of the package that we have set out this morning to vote to postpone. But I would like to remind you that there are additional aspects to these relations, especially the political aspects, which are being examined by the Council in this development in relations between the European Union and Israel. There are then those that affect the internal market. I therefore believe that we are all basically in favour of this development in relations between Israel and the European Union, in the same way as we are in favour of the development in relations with the Palestinian Authority. This report, however, must contain clarity and commitments from both sides. As things stand today, we cannot say that these criteria are being met. I would like to remind you not only of the tragic situation in Gaza, but also of the continuing illegal settlement in the territories. This is an issue which affects the marketing of products from the occupied territories and other matters which we are very familiar with. In my view, the Council must basically make its position clearly understood, if only because it seems to me that the French Presidency has undertaken to present at the next Council meeting a document on the prospects for peace in the Middle East. This may be of great interest to us, even as an opportunity to develop constructive relations. For this reason, I believe that it was a wise decision to request this postponement, providing that we all manage to use this time to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian population, especially in Gaza. I would like to add that we should also use the time to rebuild relations between Europe and the United States on the basis of a joint initiative on resolving the situation in the Middle East. Do not forget that 2008 was declared – or would have been – the year of the Constitution of the State of Palestine. 2008 is over and the situation is still awful.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have followed the Union for the Mediterranean initiative, on which next Sunday’s summit in Paris will focus and we hope that the initiative is successful. I would like to clarify a few things, however. This initiative aims to reinforce the multilateral Euro-Mediterranean dimension. I believe this is right and that we should go in this direction. I think that if there is a policy that needs a critical appraisal, however, it is the neighbourhood with the southern countries, because the neighbourhood policy actually brings countries into competition with one another that are very divided. So we need to work on integration between these countries and between them and Europe, and channel resources into that as well. I will tell you this openly, President-in-Office of the Council, that we really did not appreciate – and I am saying this to President Barroso as well – your stopping funding for the Audiovisuel Méditerranée 
programme, which was the only cultural co-production instrument. You have said that there is a European cultural exception but I would add, Mr President, that there is a Euro-Mediterranean cultural exception. If you consider the world’s top twenty intellectuals, in the top ten you will find many from the Muslim culture and a great many Euro-Mediterranean ones. So let us help one another to put in place effective policies to change the lives of many people in these countries, especially young people and women, who place hope in Europe. We do not need good students: we need to change the reality of this relationship and Parliament is very ready to cooperate with your Presidency if you intend to move in that direction.

Mr President, I should like to give a favourable opinion on the Lambsdorff report, which once again highlights the European Parliament’s commitment to strengthening the European Union’s profile in the United Nations. I should like, however, to stress that, on the issue of the reform of the Security Council, the report puts forward a value judgment prejudicial to the discussions still under way in New York. In particular, among the various reform options on the table, mention is made of the ‘Overarching Process’ (paragraph Q), a proposal to increase the number of permanent national members of the Security Council. That proposal has up to now been supported by less than one third of the Member States of the United Nations General Assembly. I would therefore ask you to minute my reservation about this section of the recommendation.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament wished to react immediately to the Commission's communication. This is because, as the Commissioner herself said, we are keen to see a revival, renewal and development of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. We support the Commission's view that the European Union should be the key institutional and political player – on the European side – in building the Union for the Mediterranean. This may also encourage our partners in the South to cooperate more closely among themselves, something that has hitherto proved exceedingly difficult. We agree that the task of the Union for the Mediterranean should be economic and territorial integration among the countries of the Mediterranean Basin, to be brought about by means of major infrastructure projects, and we also believe that the examples put forward by the Commission are appropriate. For this purpose, however, it must be clear who does what. Above all, any overlap between the role of the Commission and that of the prospective secretariat must be avoided. As for the revival of the partnership, we are of course keen to bolster its political dimension: we are interested not just in dialogue between governments but in the role of parliaments, in the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliament and in its work and that of civil society, where I would strongly emphasise that the social partners play a fundamental role. Finally, it must be clear that the projects set out in the Commission's communication should not be carried out to the detriment of regional programmes already under way in the culture, heritage, training and audiovisual fields. In this regard we would appeal for the Erasmus Mundus programme to be better resourced and for the Euromed Audiovisual programme to be refinanced.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment replaces paragraph 1 of the original text, as follows:  ‘Welcomes the Doha Agreement reached by the parties on the election of General Suleiman as President of the Republic in the coming days, the creation of a new national unity government and the adoption of the election law; calls on the parties to fully implement this agreement; stresses the importance of the positive reaction given by the international community; congratulates the Lebanese parties on the agreement and Qatar and the Arab League on their successful mediation.’

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is renewed talk of war in Lebanon. The political impasse, which has already involved 27 postponements of the convening of Parliament to elect the President of the Republic, could deteriorate, making Lebanon fertile ground once again for inter-Arab conflict and a for now latent source of tension between Iran and Hezbollah and Israel. The Arab League Summit in Damascus failed, as has been mentioned. However, there is feverish external activity on the part of the Prime Minister, Fouad Siniora, and the Speaker of the Lebanese parliament, Nabih Berri. These two strands of diplomacy that I would say are running in parallel, but until now have not been communicating, represent the dialogue of the deaf that has been dragging on for months between the majority and the opposition. In my opinion, any attempt to contribute to solving the crisis in Lebanon must necessarily take account of both the internal and the international situation. In fact, all the Lebanese forces have strong links outside the country, some of which are tighter than others. Against this background it will be important to assess the results of the summit taking place today in Sharm el-Sheikh between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. It would be useful if an extraordinary meeting of Arab League Ministers could be called as soon as possible, as requested by Prime Minister Siniora, to try to bring Damascus to a position where it respects Lebanon independence. Within this framework, however, I would not leave out an analysis of the truly unique socio-economic situation in that, despite the crisis that followed the war, Lebanon saw its GDP grow by 4% in 2007. However, the social situation is very difficult. A general strike has been called by the trade unions for 7 May, in a bid to raise minimum wages, and according to UN data, one million Lebanese out of a population of four million are living below the poverty line on less than two dollars a day. If we want to help with finding a solution, let us ensure that 22 April is not wasted, not least because 21 August looks like it will be an impossible date to get through. This is the date the candidate for the Presidency has given for his resignation as head of the armed forces because he has reached the age limit. If a solution has not been found by that date, the crisis will spread to the army, as well as bringing an end to the candidacy of General Suleiman for good. I would like to finish with the words of Prime Minister Siniora: ‘Lebanon cannot be governed from Damascus, but it cannot be governed against Damascus either.’ This seems to me a balanced position, and a benchmark for any initiative by the European Union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope it will be useful for the European Parliament to make its voice heard on the tragic events in Tibet, prior to the meeting of the European Foreign Ministers. It is important, first of all, to act on the request of the Dalai Lama for an independent commission to go to Tibet so as to let the world know the truth and the true scope of this tragedy. Then there is the situation of numerous prisoners, and reports of disappearances, reports of recourse to torture: we must shed light on all of this. Secondly, the appalling crisis of the last few days should make the international community strive to find a negotiated solution which – with due respect for the UN resolutions that do exist even though no one refers to them any more – enables the Tibetan people to see their culture, their language and their religion being respected. For this purpose among others, the political role of the Dalai Lama is irreplaceable: indeed, he is the guarantor of a balance which does not push the Tibetan question all the way to independence, but consequently he is nonetheless intransigent on the question of his people’s rights. While there is still time, it is vital to defuse the tension between Chinese nationalism and the Tibetan independence movement. The words which the Dalai Lama addressed to his people, even threatening to resign, testify to the risks. That is why, if the Chinese authorities really want peace, they must accept the political role of the Dalai Lama and enter into direct negotiations with him. The brutal repression of the past few days could indicate that the Chinese have made their decision, and if that decision is taken to extremes it will end in tragedy. Finally, on the Olympic Games, I wish to say the following to Europe’s governments: please do not make us watch this spectacle about who is and who is not going. The Dalai Lama has maintained with some justification that to isolate China would help neither the Tibetan cause nor the more general cause of human rights. I think it is wrong to say that the Dalai Lama cannot do otherwise, because that implies the man is insincere, whereas he has demonstrated that he is not; such statements can only weaken him. The message we wish to send to the Council is this: shoulder your responsibilities, present a united front; what we need is not a gesture but a coherent long-term policy. Then we shall start to look at China without the schizophrenia which has led multinational companies, including European ones, to oppose progress in the field of trade union rights, and we shall send a clear message to the Chinese authorities, namely that a major economic and commercial power has obligations on both the domestic and international fronts; this applies before, after and even during the Olympics.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have asked to speak because I am very concerned about the direction the debate is taking in Italy and to some extent here, and also about the information that is being given to citizens, because it now appears that a magic solution is the only way out of this crisis: force and militarisation, on the one hand, and incinerators, on the other. The public is hoping, therefore, that someone will come in from outside to resolve this problem; the information they are being given does not focus on the fact that there will be no solution unless waste is reduced and sorted and civic behaviour changes. That is the responsibility of the local authorities because they thought that the problems could be solved by delegating them to a firm called Impregilo
. They have passed the buck and have connived with and are in the thrall of that power.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the context and constraints affecting the Commission in the field of foreign policy, and so we are grateful for the efforts it has made, for example, to ensure that aid continues to reach the Palestinian people after the dramatic turn taken by events following the legislative elections. On this subject, we would suggest to the Commission that it prepare as of now for possible future scenarios, whether the Annapolis conference is a success - as we hope it will be - or a failure. On the neighbourhood policy, as has already been said, we would quite frankly have expected more than the brief progress report given in the text of the programme. A debate has begun on the future of our Mediterranean policy - I do not know whether President Sarkozy will choose to broach this topic in his speech today - and the Commission should without doubt undertake a more detailed assessment of these policies. It should also make proposals for the future, involving this House rather more than it has done in the past, given that tomorrow we are to discuss Parliament's report on the neighbourhood policy. Furthermore, we would urge greater consistency between internal EU policies - such as agriculture, fisheries, trade and immigration - and our development cooperation policies with the poorest countries, especially in Africa. Finally, the reference to Latin America strikes us as very weak. We would honestly expect relations between the European Union and this major continent to feature more prominently on Europe's agenda, given that Latin America is so crucial to decisions on the environment as well as to other policies such as trade and energy. Those, then, are the main points I wished to highlight on behalf of my Group.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the third time this year the European Parliament is returning to the subject of a moratorium. We believe that it is possible to achieve this objective by the end of the year, and that is why we are urgently asking the Portuguese Presidency to table the text in the next few hours with the relevant United Nations committee. We ask it to do so in close collaboration with Italy, the country which initiated the campaign, and to associate with it not only the countries of the European Union but also all those that have shown willingness to be co-sponsors and co-authors. I would also like once again to make it clear that the aim of the moratorium does not conflict with the more general aim of abolition and in any case it is a moratorium that we wish to obtain today, partly as a first concrete step towards abolition. None of this must be allowed to muddy the waters! Finally, I join with my fellow Members in disbelief that a European country as significant as Poland should have dissociated itself from declaring 10 October European Day against the death penalty and that as a result of this the Day has been put on hold. Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, we ask you not to abandon this objective. Please do not dissipate that little spirit that we have succeeded in introducing into a Europe that is still swayed too strongly by questions of economic policy, trade policy and monetarism.

 Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Solana, ladies and gentlemen, as has been pointed out, this debate is taking place on the 40th anniversary of the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. What was supposed to be a lightning strike has turned into a never-ending nightmare: 40 years is such a long time that entire generations of Palestinians have never known anything but occupation, humiliation, checkpoints and then the wall and almost total imprisonment. Movement is now all but impossible in the occupied territories. Over these 40 years, Israel has certainly not found the guarantees of security that it was looking for, either, and it has experienced worrying erosions of democracy and the rule of law. These are two peoples exhausted by endless war and violence. For our part, we would like to emphasise – as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has long been saying quite clearly – that the only possible way to inject any form of a constructive approach into a constantly deteriorating situation is to openly support the Palestinian Government of National Unity. We should add to that the commitment that the international community should consider making to send in a peace-keeping force to prevent the violence of recent weeks in Gaza from degenerating even further, to re-establish the basic conditions for people to lead normal lives and for international law to be respected, and above all to break the vicious circle of endless violence. From Israel we expect gestures other than the murders and indiscriminate arrests that came in response to the Qassam rocket strikes on Sderot. The occupation, the settlements, the wall and the status of Jerusalem are making the prospect of a two-State solution more unlikely every day, as even United Nations sources are now saying. The United Nations, the United States, Russia, Europe and the entire international community have a responsibility to act before all chances of coexistence are gone for ever. Lastly, I would remind you that there is an Arab plan that offers Israel a prospect of peace, not only with the Palestinians but with Arab countries as a whole. That is something that needs addressing with more conviction. Prime Minister Olmert himself said the other day that that plan could provide a basis for negotiations. I hope he did not say so just because his government is particularly weak. The situation in Lebanon is equally serious, as you have pointed out. I believe that the UNIFIL forces on the ground should be supported and reinforced. Lastly, we should like to call on President Poettering to take steps to call an extraordinary meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.

Madam President, Mr Gloser, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, death and violence have returned to Gaza, Lebanon and Israel. As the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we stress the urgent need for a substantive change in the European Union’s policy in the Middle East, with full restoration of financial aid to the Palestinian institutions and people. The conflicts of recent days are the product of exasperation and the stalemate in the political situation, as well as demonstrating and confirming the fact that Israel will not build its own security on the death of Palestine and Palestinians. European democracy’s double standards towards the government of national unity must cease, as the political continuity of that government is the only hope for regaining control of the situation. The decision, however, to suspend financial aid to the institutions seems even more absurd since the formation of the government of national unity. The fact that the Council and the Commission have decided not to meet ministerial representatives of Hamas and the independents does nothing for the stability of that executive body, which is currently the only form of political expression open to the Palestinian people. The Mecca agreement, even if it is not an uncritical repetition of the Quartet’s four points, is obviously a step in the right direction, in the sense of mutual recognition and the cessation of violence. On this basis we must work to ensure that the situation develops in a positive direction. Another reason is, as the Commissioner pointed out, that Abu Amr, the Foreign Affairs Minister, who last week was here with us in Brussels, gave us an enormous amount of reassurance on this aspect. We join with the grief and condemnation over the launch of missiles on Sderot and also the fact that people were killed and injured there, but at the same time we wish to call upon the Palestinian and Israeli authorities to cease disproportionate, excessive and illegal retaliation against Palestinian political and civilian figures. A perverse dynamic has been set back in motion and we Europeans must try to help stop it. I would like to remind you that the 78 people who died within a few days in Lebanon speak volumes about another poisoned fruit of the unresolved Arab-Israeli conflict, and that is the fact that in Lebanon open conflict may break out again with the 400 000 Palestinian refugees present in that country. We have already experienced that nightmare, so let us seek to prevent it, just as last July we put a stop to the war and Israel’s aggression towards Lebanon.

 Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Arif report is, in my opinion, an historic one for the European Parliament. It addresses the commercial dimension of Euro-Mediterranean relations in a novel and thorough way. However, the political groups have decided to follow up the report with a debate and resolution; the debate covers the report, of course, but it is also about taking stock of this policy. I do not hide the fact that we are a little concerned about the prospects of working in partnership with the Mediterranean countries, because the neighbourhood policy, which should have given these relations a consciously continental dimension, is in danger of fragmenting this policy. We have great respect and appreciation for the work that the Commission is doing in negotiating the action plans country by country, but we would point out that the action plans are only a part of this policy and that major problems such as employment, the fight against poverty, the environment and the recovery of the Mediterranean not just as a physical area but also as an environmental, cultural, political and economic one require a broader approach, a multilateral policy and a more substantial political investment from the European Union. That is why we would ask the Council, and particularly the German Presidency, which has shown great sensitivity on this dossier, to take another step forwards with, we hope, the support of the Parliamentary Assembly that is to meet in Tunis next week. I would recall that the Parliamentary Assembly is the only political forum where the North and the South can talk and also the only political forum where Israelis and Palestinians still talk.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution on which we will vote tomorrow and this evening's debate situate the European Parliament in that international movement that is appealing to the United Nations General Assembly to adopt a resolution for a universal moratorium, which is a first step towards the general abolition of the death penalty from the statute books of every country. As has been said, we would like the Council of Ministers to actively commit itself to achieving this objective; the Presidency is very committed, and we hope that this point remains one of the priorities of its term of office. The same commitment has been made by the Council of Europe and the European Commission. From what she has said, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner does not actually seem to me to be very convinced of the fact that, as a first step, we need to go through a moratorium. I, on the other hand, would emphasise this point, and I would ask Mrs Ferrero-Waldner: Would not going through a moratorium bring abolition any closer? I do not think so: this could therefore be a first step, not least because the European Union, in its international relations, could bring to bear the extensive relations it enjoys in the context of the neighbourhood policy, the association agreements and the strategic partnership, and, in my opinion, Europe’s political parties could also do their best within international forums to ensure that their organisations put pressure on the participating countries. I believe that the aim is to banish the death penalty from the statute books of every State, an act that would, among other things, help to ensure that the United Nations enjoys a reputation for being an institution that safeguards universally recognised rights.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, as a European Parliament, we have no choice but to associate ourselves with the universal condemnation of the nuclear tests apparently carried out by North Korea. Our firm condemnation should be accompanied by a commitment by the European Union and the whole international community to try at this time to find a solution to this very grave problem by negotiation. We must persuade this dictatorship to respect the rules of international coexistence. Nevertheless, the international community has no choice: we must seriously find a way to achieve non-proliferation. I should like to say to Mr Brok that this is not a matter of blaming anyone; but it is in my view impossible not to recognise that the weakening of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which was clearly due also to the failure of the 2005 conference, was a fatal mistake. I therefore consider that any prospective emergency solution must be based on the resumption of the negotiations for the revision of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. This is an obligatory task that the international community must carry out consistently, since only thus – although in another situation – shall we have the necessary clout to impose respect for this line of conduct upon the Pyongyang dictatorship. It must be said that this pre-emptive Iraq war has, perversely, convinced dictators that possessing nuclear weapons is a sort of safe-conduct. It is our job to convince world governments, including the rulers of authoritarian states, that this is absolutely not the case: otherwise we will not halt rearmament. Finally, Mr Solana, I should like you to explain the differences between North Korea and Iran, since the two cases are too often associated with each other – yet I believe that there lies in the differences the details of a possible solution.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the assessment of Turkey’s progress in the EU accession process should focus more on the content of the assessments relating specifically to the Copenhagen criteria and the dossiers relating to the acquis communautaire
. I shall avoid introducing distractions – new criteria that do not help a process that is already in itself difficult and requires us to be transparent, consistent and objective. In that respect, I agree with paragraph 50, as proposed by the rapporteur, on the Armenian genocide issue. This country plays a crucial role in a geopolitical area that runs from the Mashreq to South-East Asia and the Caucasus. That leads us to support the efforts of all those who are working for a democratic, peaceful Turkey. Having said that, we must be strict in our judgments and demand that the Turkish Government, together with all its state machinery and institutions and Turkish society, make a serious commitment to those areas in which progress has to be more significant and constant. Those areas include civil, political and social rights, freedom of expression and, particularly, the rights of minorities, primarily those of the Kurdish minority and of women, who are in fact in the majority. We hope for a firm condemnation of terrorism and the implementation of the Ankara protocol by the agreed deadlines. To conclude, let us try to keep to the point and to be credible and effective in continuing to positively influence internal developments in this country and its external role in establishing peace and stability in an explosive region where the most serious threats to peace are concentrated.

 Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as you have said, the fact that we have succeeded in obtaining a ceasefire is already an important result in a war that, in just a few weeks, has caused a great many deaths, destroyed infrastructure and the environment, and was threatening to engulf the whole region. This initial result is the outcome of a European initiative in close cooperation with the United Nations. Allow me to mention the active role played by my own country, Italy, and also by the Finnish Presidency and by France, which is to lead UNIFIL during this phase. The challenge, however, remains much more arduous and requires the whole of Europe to make not just a military effort, but a political and diplomatic one. For the first time, Europe could demonstrate a united political will and the determination to play a constructive role in the Mediterranean and Middle East by equipping itself with the appropriate tools. It is a question of supporting Lebanon in the difficult process of independence and sovereignty, helping it to continue along the democratic path that raised so much hope during the ‘Beirut spring’. The Lebanese army has to regain control of the whole country, including the south, and it has to exercise a monopoly on military strength to the exclusion of Hizbollah, which in recent times has become a parallel power. Such an outcome requires everyone to take responsibility, starting with Syria, which has a role in the region, while Israel must be persuaded to abandon the idea of the indiscriminate use of force, because that is not a path that can guarantee its security. It has already been said that the Palestinian issue lies at the heart of the Middle East situation. Europe’s task is to fully accept the responsibility that all the parties in the conflict now attribute to it: to support the Palestinians’ difficult internal process of forming a new government that will enable them to come out of isolation and win back the resources that Israel must return to them. It could be the beginning of a new climate of relations between the two sides, but first of all the spiral of violence needs to stop. The years of experience that we have acquired show that the two sides cannot do it alone: the international community’s presence is essential, and so we could deploy the peacekeeping troops that are in Lebanon today to Gaza and the West Bank tomorrow. It could be a first step towards restoring that agreement, in the run-up to an international conference that may lead to a stable, lasting solution for the entire area, as the President-in-Office mentioned.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a real humanitarian disaster has been taking place in Gaza over the last few hours, involving more than one million civilians. UN, UNICEF and WFP reports talk of a desperate situation. Gaza has become a prison in which an entire population is being collectively punished. The international community had finally come to an agreement to ensure that the Palestinians received the aid they needed to survive via the European Union, but all of that is now pointless since Gaza is practically isolated and nothing is getting through to an exhausted and humiliated population. The Palestinian issue cannot, however, become a humanitarian issue, because it remains a major political issue. The indiscriminate decapitation of Hamas was, for its part, an act of madness, firstly because the members of parliament and the ministers now legitimately represent the majority of the Palestinian population, but mainly because Prime Minister Haniyeh had given the go-ahead to the so-called ‘prisoners’ document’ and had actually dissociated himself from the most intransigent of the positions adopted by the Hamas representatives in Syria, avoiding the referendum and paving the way for a coalition government in Palestine. With these actions, the Israeli authorities are in real danger of once again encouraging the most extreme and violent fringes of Palestinian society. Corporal Gilad Shalit must be released, just as an entire population must be released from the grip of an army that is infringing every aspect of the law. In the past, the European Parliament has pressed for aid to be allowed to get through to the Palestinian population; today, the same Parliament is calling on the European governments and the Presidency to demand respect for fundamental human rights, so that people can resume their lives in Gaza and so that political prospects can be re-established in place of violence and abuses of power.

Mr President, Mr Winkler, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, I confess to having doubts about the way in which EU policy is shaping up in the difficult situation in the Middle East. I am worried about the fact that the decisions made by the Council are liable not to facilitate even a gradual transformation of an objectively difficult situation; I am worried about the risk of further radicalisation that may result from the desperation in Palestine. I am not disputing the fact that the requests directed by the Union to the new government in Palestine are fair; it is the means used for this purpose that puzzle me: the Palestinian people must be able to count on our full economic, political and moral support. You say that you want to continue to guarantee the provision not only of emergency aid, but also of education and healthcare. I do not understand how this can be done if the administration is completely excluded. We also need to pay a great deal of attention to the delicate – and I stress the word delicate – relationship between the presidency and the government in Palestine. I will conclude by making three suggestions: - we should work towards consolidating Hamas’ decision to call a truce, a decision that has also been confirmed; - we should work towards developing, and devolving responsibility to, all of the actors involved in the Palestinian political framework, even with a change in the government in prospect, and propose to both of the negotiating parties that they acknowledge the agreements and the road map; - we should work towards achieving a new chapter of mutual legitimisation with the prospect of a definitive solution in mind. In this context, we can only confirm our opposition to any unilateral initiative that might jeopardise the possibility of finding a solution to unresolved issues such as that relating to borders, up to and including the status of Jerusalem.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, energy policy has a clear external dimension, which emerged dramatically in the January crisis between Russia and Ukraine. For its part, the European Union has in recent years put in place policies such as strategic cooperation with Russia, the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, the Neighbourhood Policy and the agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council. These relations involve the main oil and gas producing countries. The energy issue has been tackled in a disjointed manner: from liberalisation of the markets to security of supply, efficiency and better use of resources. To date, all this has not looked like a structured policy. The European Council meeting tomorrow and the day after will tackle these issues, but European governments seem divided over whether we need to have a common policy or whether we should continue with bilateral relations based on historical, geographical or political factors. As the European Parliament, we support the Commission’s efforts and at the same time ask for more. This will not be possible, however, without answers to some major questions. Are we intending to reduce overall dependence on fossil fuels? By how much? Are we able to estimate future needs on this point? Are we setting ourselves the target of coordinating demand with other importing countries, above all developing countries? Will we submit a single, unanimous proposal at the next G8 meeting in Saint Petersburg? The answers to these questions presuppose something very like a European energy plan. The Green Paper constitutes a first step, but there is a lot more to be done and the European Parliament naturally wishes to be fully involved in this policy.

Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the dramatic events of the last few hours in Palestine force us to reach a view and, as you said, Commissioner, go right to the heart of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. I would like to say to the Israeli authorities that an electoral campaign, however important, cannot permit the distortion of existing legal frameworks. One of these frameworks, the main one, is the role of President Abu Mazen, damaged and deprived of authority by the irresponsible attack on the prison in Jericho and by the capture of prisoners whose detention was the competence of the Palestinian authority. I would also like to hear a view from the Council on the conduct of the United Kingdom and United States forces present in the area. All our moral and political support goes to the President of the Palestinian Authority, who should have been among us here today. We are aware of his very difficult position, particularly after the result of the legislative elections in Palestine. As you said, Commissioner, Europe must remind the Israeli authorities of the need to respect the law and their legitimate partners, just as we demand of Hamas itself. Defying the legal framework means opening the door to the sort of retaliation and violence that is already going on and that we need to try and stem. We are relieved in this matter by news of the freeing of the hostages. As for the crisis in Iran, another sorry chapter, I welcomed the words of Mr Straw, which I hope he will hold to completely. He stated that no military option exists. He made explicit a position that the whole of Europe ought to take and to which the Socialist Group in the European Parliament fully subscribes, as it is also our position. Stopping negotiations would lead to the disastrous state of affairs already seen in Iraq. This does not make us weaker: on the contrary, it opens up the chance for close dialogue, and reassures the Iranian and Syrian people, who feel threatened. Let us relieve the tension and avoid creating undesirable alliances forged in the name of the fight against the West. Let us keep the international community united in putting pressure on Iran to respect the obligations it signed up to under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, with a view to disarmament in the Middle East and in the whole of the Mediterranean. It is to be hoped that over this extremely delicate period Europe can express itself with one voice, autonomously and effectively, and that the next Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly can become the perfect occasion to confront these issues.

Mr President, I should like to draw Members’ attention to the fact that, in recent days, there have been various cases of missionaries being murdered in Burundi and the Philippines. Yesterday, in Angola, an 80-year-old missionary was murdered. Obviously, the most moving case was that of Don Andrea, an Italian missionary murdered in Trabzon, Turkey. I should like to pay tribute to this man and to his sacrifice, partly because he was caught up in a climate of tension between the Islamic world and Europe. On his behalf, I should like to call on Members to support anyone seeking to break this circle of hate, partly because I am sure that there is a large majority of men and women of good will, be they Muslims or Christians, or indeed atheists and non-believers. I should therefore like to remind Parliament, too, of Don Andrea’s message.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Europeans we have to respect the outcome of the free vote in Palestine and encourage those elected to form a government that chooses the path of negotiation, recognises Israel and renounces violence, as President Abu Mazen himself has indicated. The outcome of the vote also reflects the suffering and humiliation of daily life under occupation, squeezed between checkpoints, wall and settlements, and at the same time it rings out as a severe criticism of Palestinian politicians. The unilateral withdrawal from Gaza has itself weakened the position of President Abu Mazen, for obvious reasons. That therefore gives rise to two compelling needs: not to abandon the prospect of a negotiated peace, and to call on both parties to renounce any actions that might jeopardise peace. I therefore agree with the clear conditions that you, Mr Solana, have set the Palestinians. In the same spirit, however, I ask you: do you have no objections to make to Israel, which has never accepted the idea of operating within the roadmap? This debate has started in Israeli society. In addition, Hamas itself has shown its ability to respect a negotiated truce for an entire year. I believe that Israel should put a stop to the settlements and avoid taking any steps to annex East Jerusalem. On the subject of financial aid, I agree with you absolutely: it is essential to prevent collapse and to assess the situation as it unfolds. In the same spirit, I should like to put a question to you, Mr Solana, as well as to the Council and the Commission: do you not think we should put pressure on the Israeli authorities to stop blocking the transfer of tax revenues to the Palestinians? Since it is Palestinian money, I feel that in the current situation the Israelis are adding fuel to the fire.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mrs Ferrero-Waldner for the information she has provided us with. I should also like to send my best wishes to Prime Minister Sharon, as well as to Mrs Livni, for the important tasks she is taking on within the Israeli Government. The situation in the Middle East is constantly changing. In Israel, Deputy Prime Minister Olmert seems determined to take forward the process begun by Prime Minister Sharon, in view of the elections on 28 March. In Palestine, the imminent elections – the outcome of which is by no means clear – bring with them the important news that Hamas is standing in the national parliamentary elections for the first time. We are faced with a dynamic situation, but one that is vulnerable to further setbacks. The extremely fragile peace process – one might say that it never got off the ground in the way it was designed to in the Road Map – may be ruined once and for all by the escalating situation in the entire area, from the difficulties in stabilising Iraq to the alarming position taken by the Iranian leadership, the fragile situation in Lebanon, the role of Syria and the turbulent situation within Egypt. Returning to the Palestinian elections, I do not wish to sidestep that most thorny of issues – that is to say, the issue of Hamas. Regardless of the outcome of the elections, Hamas will play a key role in relation to the institutional representation of the Palestinian people. I will refrain from doing or saying anything that might increase the support for, and influence of, Hamas and I will instead try to emphasise the fact that if a movement aspires to the highest echelons of political and institutional representation, then it must be willing to play the democratic game, starting with respect for international law and an end to violence. From that point of view, I see it as a positive development that Hamas candidates have signed the code of conduct, even though there remains a general feeling of concern at the climate of violence in which the elections will take place, particularly in Gaza. I should, however, like us to be more appreciative of the pluralism that is emerging in Palestine, which is also symbolised by new, secular electoral lists, bearing witness to the need for democracy, transparency and efforts to combat corruption. The state of Israeli-Palestinian relations also has a bearing on the situation within Palestine. That is another reason why Israel should stop the settlements in all the territories and refrain from acting in such a way as to jeopardise the chances of resolving the conflict, beginning with East Jerusalem, where a real annexation policy is being pursued. The voting agreement in East Jerusalem is therefore – as you said – a positive development, even though we are well aware of its limitations, having observed the Presidential elections. Nevertheless, it still has huge symbolic value. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a real risk that the European project may collapse, and we have the evidence for it. To build or rebuild the people’s trust we need vision, effective policies and means, and the means include financial resources and the institutions. I believe that we, as Parliament, must not abandon the prospect of the Constitutional Treaty. As for the diatribe about the current text, I think Parliament must defend everything that has been gained through it. Will the debate be able to move on? I do not think it will be easy but, quite frankly, I am not going to rule out that path, either. Moreover, as has already been emphasised, I should like us to take that path in close collaboration with the national parliaments, since the way the debate on the subject has been conducted, particularly by European governments, has, in my view, been neither thorough nor correct. I should like to thank the Austrian Presidency for having at last partly resurrected the debate. Let us hope that from now on the various institutions can be more in tune with each other.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Tannock, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to invite the Commission to take the report before us into serious consideration, since it did not do so with the resolution adopted by this Parliament in 2003. That resolution, in fact, contains a series of useful suggestions for enhancing the neighbourhood policy, which is one of the most important challenges facing Europe. The constructive relations that we shall be able to develop with our neighbours in fact represent the only prospect for creating peace and security around our borders. There are two main reasons why this will not be an easy task. The first is that we are surrounded by areas of great instability and conflict: from Chechnya to Nagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria, Afghanistan, Iraq and the Middle East. Secondly, the aim of this policy is not accession to the Union, which makes it more difficult to succeed in influencing both internal reform in the various countries and relations among those countries and between them and the Union. Some of the countries currently involved in the neighbourhood policy look forward to achieving full EU membership – the rapporteur has already mentioned the cases of Ukraine and Moldova. Even if we do not rule out that prospect, we should at least be honest and say that membership is not currently feasible, both because of the Union’s internal situation and because of the progress that those countries themselves still need to make. All that, however, provides further support for this policy. The aspect that I have chosen to emphasise is the enhancement of the overall vision of the neighbourhood policy, even though it covers diverse areas in the east, south-east and south, as well as countries that differ greatly among themselves. Security, energy, immigration, the environment and human rights require vision and political dialogue, as well as specific institutions in order to be able to make progress together. Together with the action plans that the Commission is negotiating, this is the dimension that needs to be enhanced, including by means of specific policies, such as the energy policy, which the Commissioner singled out. Back in 2003, Parliament pointed out that energy was an area that required attention in relations with neighbouring countries; today we reiterate that need for attention and call for a communication to be drawn up on those aspects of energy policy that concern our foreign and neighbourhood policy. I shall conclude, therefore, with my initial appeal to the Commission and the Commissioner, who has an excellent relationship with us: do not undervalue the European Parliament’s contribution.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we too endorsed the need to hold this debate, because we want the serious remarks made by the Iranian President, Mr Ahmadinejad, regarding the existence of the State of Israel to be met with a firm, unanimous response from the European Parliament. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament believes that the seriousness of what has happened should not be underestimated, since those words were uttered at an extremely sensitive moment in the Middle East situation. The truth is that fortunately, within days, we heard the statements by the former leader Mr Khatami, which ran in a completely different direction. In fact, he came out against any kind of crusade, war or violence, declaring them immoral. Returning to the Middle East, on the one hand hopes have been raised again for a peace process that will lead to the emergence of the Palestinian State alongside the State of Israel, a solution that for us has never been and will never be an issue. On the other hand, however, we realise that this process has many enemies and that terrorism is in fact backing those who do not want a solution to this tragic situation. Peace, democracy, freedom and social justice are the values that we want to prevail in the Middle East, and we want Europe to play an ever greater role in making that happen. We therefore welcome the fact that the European Union has accepted responsibility for controlling the border at Rafah, which we hope may soon become one of the borders of the Palestinian State. Iran is a great country and we do not want it to isolate itself from the international community. Quite the opposite: we believe that the decisions it makes, starting with a clear and incontrovertible rejection of nuclear weapons, can help bring about peaceful stability throughout the region. Israel and Palestine are linked by a single destiny and wiping out Israel would mean wiping out Palestine. I say that because it is time to unmask those who help to maintain the Palestinians’ tragic situation by pretending to uphold their rights. Unlike President Ahmadinejad, we shall strive to add a new state to the map of the Middle East. Lastly, let us assure Israel that Europe cannot forget the Holocaust, because that would mean denying the very reasons for its existence as a political project.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity as deputy for the draftsman, Mrs De Keyser, I should like to highlight three points raised by the Committee on Foreign Affairs. The first point concerns the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, for which we do not accept the 25% cut proposed by the Commission and we call for at least the 2005 budget figure to be restored. The second point concerns aid for reconstruction in Iraq. We should like the Community’s money to be spent transparently by entrusting it to the United Nations agencies operating in Iraq. Lastly, we call on the Council for greater clarity when mentioning the use of funds for the European Union special representatives. Pending explanations from the Council, the Committee on Foreign Affairs has proposed cutting the payment appropriations ascribed to the budget line in question by EUR 1.5 million.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like quickly to highlight three aspects of this process. The first is the connection between the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and the Neighbourhood Policy, which was raised by the Commissioner. I believe this aspect must not lead us to focus solely on bilateral action plans, but should encourage us to create a geographical and political space that is both European and Mediterranean. The principal means of all that is the political dimension, which has increased, it must be said, because the European Parliament has contributed to the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, and the civil societies have set up the civil forum. What is missing are the governments. Where are the governments? I believe that to move forward with this process we need parliaments, societies and governments to engage somewhat more in dialogue, which in turn will enable us to create a more advanced human rights dimension. Finally, the sociologist Edgard Morin is quite right when he points out that it is not cultures, religions and civilisations that engage in dialogue, but people, individuals, men and women. I believe that the most serious limitation in all the years of this very generous and intelligent process has been the failure to make our different societies relate to each other, and because of that, terrorism and immigration today threaten to widen the gulf even further. I agree with our rapporteur when she says we must reinforce all the programmes and instruments that foster dialogue and understanding – and hence education, culture, training and information – between our societies. In short, we support our rapporteur because her report moves in that direction, and because Euro-Mediterranean politics need less rhetoric and a great deal more substance.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Alexander, Mr Figel’, the decision by the Iranian authorities to suspend negotiations with the three European countries acting as negotiators is worrying. I would like, however, to state right away and without ambiguity that we rule out any kind of military solution to this crisis. On that point, we call on the United States Administration to become involved in these negotiations, as it did with some success in the case of North Korea. We are, actually, concerned by this difference in the attitude of the United States, partly because many of Iran’s concerns about its own security spring directly from the attitude of the US, its policy in the region and the pressure that is being exerted, partly in military terms, in the military bases located in areas bordering Iran. Iran, for its part, must suspend any activity designed to obtain nuclear material for military purposes; it must do so because it has signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty, thus also undertaking to apply its Additional Protocol. We therefore fully support the resolution by the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which mandated its Director General, Dr El Baradei – who has since been deservedly awarded the Nobel Prize for peace – to continue to pursue the path of negotiation. We also welcome the European Council’s resolution of 3 October. Our endorsement is not at all a formality, since we believe that this approach is particularly wise. Indeed, as is well known and as the Iranian authorities are well aware and as Mr Alexander also pointed out, this issue falls within the competence of the United Nations Security Council. The decision not to launch a procedure which could lead to an escalation of the situation is thus a choice which makes the path of negotiation even more persuasive, offering Iran a chance which should not be missed. In the interests of greater clarity I should state that Iran, like any country in the world, has the right to equip itself with nuclear capacity for non-military purposes, and that is clear both in the resolution from the International Agency for Atomic Energy and in our resolution. I would like to conclude with an appeal to the Council on the issue of human rights, an issue that everyone has alluded to. In our resolution we referred to the cases mentioned by you, Mr Alexander. I would like to encourage the Commission and the Council to continue the policy of dialogue, and never to separate human rights issues from trade agreements with Iran.

 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you have pointed out in your speeches, the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza was an important move in the right direction. We should have preferred it, however, if it had happened within the framework set out in the roadmap and with the Quartet playing a different role. In any case, it has shown that it is possible to make progress without violence on the road to peace and compliance with international law. We are not ignoring the tensions that have arisen within part of Israeli society and particularly in the political sphere in that country, especially in relation to the prospects that are now opening up and the further steps that have to be taken. An important factor in this situation is the commitment of the international community and the European Union to pursue the only feasible prospect: that of continuing the peace process until the Palestinian people’s right to have a sovereign state is realised, with peace and security for both peoples. The message that we wish to put across in this debate is very clear and is primarily a political message. The more nationalistic sectors of Israeli society, currently represented by Minister Netanyahu, must not think that they will find any space or understanding unless they comply with international law. Continuing the settlements policy will mean condemning Israel to international isolation and encouraging the most extremist sectors in the Palestinian community. At the same time, the proponents of terrorism must avoid claiming the Gaza withdrawal as a victory, since it was the outcome of the renewed prestige of the Palestinian leadership on the world stage. It is important, therefore, as you have said, that the Palestinians continue the process that started with the presidential elections. In that respect, we welcome the fact that the date has been set for political elections and we are in favour of pushing ahead with the reforms announced by President Abu Mazen when he was elected, relentlessly continuing the work of opposing terrorism and violence. For its part, however, the international community must still bear in mind that political terrorism of Islamic origin, which is also of such great concern to people in our own countries, will be dealt a decisive blow if we are able to defuse the main source of hatred and tension, which is the Middle East conflict.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must point out to the members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that there is a great difference between a vote on an association agreement and one on a resolution regarding two specific cases of human rights violations in Syria: these concern two members of parliament, one of whom has been on hunger strike for a long time. We are thus facing a real emergency situation. As regards the situation in Belarus, we are all of the same mind, and we all express our concern. I would recall, however, that on 5 July this Parliament debated the Commission’s statement and on 10 July we adopted a resolution on more or less the same topics. I believe, therefore, that Parliament’s authority lies not in repeating resolutions but rather in ensuring that its resolutions are properly followed up. To conclude, in relation to the situation of the two members of parliament and the NGOs, we call for a letter from our President; as regards the situation in Belarus, we call for a new debate, perhaps in a forthcoming plenary session, so as to put greater pressure on both the Council and the Commission. On this matter, therefore, we agree with the proposal to keep the situation in Syria among the urgent subjects for debate.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the unsuccessful agreement on the financial perspectives is all the more serious because it was the first act carried out by the Council following the problems encountered in ratifying the Treaty. Formulating new policies for Europe with fewer resources does not equate to a solution, and neither does suggesting reforms, including legitimate ones, which encroach upon other people’s privileges, without seriously questioning one’s own. The recent European Council adopted many foreign policy decisions to tackle external commitments that cannot be postponed. I hope that that is a sign of the will not to abandon an effective policy and the prospect of having a real European Foreign Minister. On the subject of Iraq, holding the Brussels Conference was important; however, the situation on the ground remains serious and out of control. The United Kingdom supported military intervention, recommending it as a means of resolving the entire Middle East crisis. That gives you added responsibility during your presidency in terms of finding a definitive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Iraq affair further confirms that Europe’s international role is unthinkable outside of a multilateral context, and it was therefore a serious mistake, in the past, to split Europe, and today, for a number of Member States to abandon the objective of a European seat in the future United Nations Security Council. You stated that you were against having a free trade area; that is an important point. However, the risk of sliding towards that prospect is in the facts: if we put a stop to political integration, if we are not able to formulate new objectives and if we do not provide institutions capable of implementing them. That is even more necessary in the perspective, with which I believe you agree, Prime Minister, of a great Europe that is not closed off to the Balkans and to Turkey.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall keep this very brief as I only wish to reaffirm some of the ideas already present in the resolution. Whilst the right to counter illegal immigration is indisputable, it is equally true that such a right must be exercised with respect for human rights and international conventions, refraining from collective expulsions and from the indifference shown by some of the receiving countries to the future fate of these people, particularly when they are repatriated to countries that have not signed international conventions, such as Libya. These are the two points that have been raised on the Lampedusa case, not by those seeking to exploit the situation, 
but by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and by the Court of Strasbourg itself, which has asked Italy to clarify its position before the start of May. We are in a situation in which, to my mind, we, as Europeans, have an element of prestige that is also recognised by countries that do not respect human rights, which is precisely that we respect those rights, or strive to. Let us please not lose this element of civilisation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our request is quite clear: we are asking to replace the item on Bangladesh with the item on Burma because we believe the situation in the latter country is more urgent. I do not think that the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of South Asia itself hopes for a resolution on Bangladesh at the moment, whereas Parliament ought to adopt a stance on Burma.

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, my group stands unreservedly shoulder to shoulder with the demonstrators of Martyrs’ Square in Beirut, who are peacefully demanding a future of freedom and democracy for their country and who have already brought about the resignation of the pro-Syrian government. The Syrian military occupation can no longer be tolerated and the time has come for the positive but vague declarations made by the President of the Syrian Republic in recent days to give way to firm action with a clear and immediate timetable. We repeat our strong condemnation of the attack which caused the death of ex-President Hariri and the loss of so many lives, and we support the determination of the United Nations Secretary-General to see a full investigation of this episode. The future of Lebanon can only be the result of a democratic process, based on respect for human rights, with a first step being a decision to forge ahead with parliamentary elections in May. Those elections must be free, democratic and transparent, which is why we are asking for them to be prepared and monitored by a team of European observers in which, as in the case of Palestine, the role of this Parliament should be a prominent one. All parts of Lebanon’s complex society must feel they are involved in this process and in the protection of their country’s unity and territorial integrity. With regard to Syria, it is a vital country in the Middle East as a whole, a country which can and must opt unreservedly for democracy, for the fight against terrorism and for a constructive role in the solution of the Israel-Palestine conflict. For a long time, Europe has had a policy of friendship towards Damascus, and I hope that the decisions taken today by its leadership will help to consolidate this relationship and render it irreversible. The countries of the Middle East as a whole have a responsibility to support the efforts of the President of the Palestinian Authority to reach a just peace with Israel and to collaborate in the development of a Palestinian state. For this purpose, there must be an end to all support for terrorism and terrorist organisations, both inside their respective states and in the Palestinian territories. Finally, we should not forget the Israeli-Syrian dimension of this conflict. Here, we hope for a re-establishment of relations, leading to a peace agreement and to the withdrawal of the Israeli army from the Golan Heights. For too long, the violence of terrorism and of armies of occupation has prevailed in the Middle East, and it is time for a return to the rule of law. Only respect for law in international relations and for democracy in internal affairs can guarantee peace, stability and prosperity across the Middle East as a whole. In this context, the European Union must redouble its efforts, enhance the effectiveness of its political role and increase and re-focus the economic resources deployed to achieve these aims.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased that the Council has decided to make 2005 the Year of the Mediterranean. Precisely for this reason, we hope that the Union will have a more important political role in this area. The Mediterranean is now our priority, because that is where the greatest challenges lie regarding peace, security, the fight against terrorism, development, respect for rights, protection of the environment and positive management of immigration. The neighbourhood policy must strengthen the spirit of Barcelona, in line with the partnership method which we could today steer in the direction of codevelopment. Ten years on from the Barcelona Intergovernmental Conference in 1995, although the results have essentially not lived up to the expectations created by this process, we must, in any case, acknowledge the progress made with regard to mutual relations and the improved application of the MEDA programme. We are encouraged, then, by the resumption of dialogue between the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority following the presidential elections in Palestine. At the same time, we are aware of the complexity of the whole Middle Eastern situation and we are concerned by the situation in Lebanon, following the bomb attack which caused the death of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. Moreover, we would urge Syria to withdraw from Lebanon and, in the same vein, we hope that Israel will pull out of the Golan Heights. This all means that the time may have come to resolve the whole Middle Eastern conflict. In this context, we appreciate the role played by Egypt, but at the same time we are troubled by the internal situation of that country where, precisely in the past few days, Mr Ayman Nour, a member of the Egyptian Parliament, was arrested and detained. Lastly, we are calling for a more incisive and coherent role for the European Union in the field of human rights, democracy and the rule of law in the whole region. The neighbourhood policy should have more appropriate instruments and institutions. We would therefore invite the Commission and the Council to take greater account of the role of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, a fundamental democratic instrument which should be supported and strengthened, and which was established through the efforts of men like Mr Renzo Imbeni. The Assembly is taking its first steps: it is the first time that it is meeting outside Europe, in Cairo, and we hope that it can hold an extraordinary meeting, presided by you, President Borrell Fontelles, precisely on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Process.

 Mr President, Mr Solana, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, the Palestinian presidential elections were a real breath of fresh air, a hope that change can at last begin in the tormented Middle East after many years of darkness, particularly in view of the fact that they were held against a background of occupation. Europe has believed in this process more than anyone else and has supported it politically and economically. Europe has a visible and substantial presence, thanks to the work of the observation mission led by our fellow Member Mr Rocard, which supported the equally remarkable work done by the Palestinian Central Election Commission, with which Parliament’s delegation, chaired by Mr McMillan-Scott, also collaborated closely. The far-sighted decision by the Palestinian leadership to entrust the choice of President Arafat’s successor to a free and transparent election process won the support of an overwhelming majority in Palestinian society. Palestinians want democracy but they also want freedom. That is why they have put their trust in a leadership that can get them out of their current desperate situation. Their new leader, Mr Mahmoud Abbas, has already shown in his election campaign and especially in the measures that he is adopting that he is seriously committed both to the domestic front, through curbing violence and initiating essential reforms for Palestinian society, and to the attempt to restart the peace process. It is now the Israeli Government’s turn to show the same constructive willingness, first by putting the unilateral actions it has announced, such as the withdrawal from Gaza, back into the context of the roadmap negotiations, and by putting a stop to the settlements and to construction of the illegal wall, as well as any other pointless acts which are designed to intimidate the Palestinian population and have nothing to do with security. Since the elections, Europe has also gained greater credibility in its role, and perhaps it can use its influence on the United States, maybe taking the opportunity offered by President Bush’s visit, as the Commissioner mentioned. Additionally, it is important to ensure that our commitment continues, because after the presidential elections there will be municipal and administrative elections. I believe we should support the political operation that the Palestinian leadership intends to carry out, which is to bring the Hamas and Islamic Jihad opposition groups, which have resorted to terrorism, back into the institutional fold. We must support such action in view of the prospect of establishing the two States. The progress that has been made and our positive assessment of it must, however, give us cause to reflect on other crises in the Middle East. I am referring directly to Iraq, where the situation is decidedly different.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that Parliament will adopt the Eurlings report on Turkey in the version approved by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and I also hope it will do so by secret ballot. I believe that my fellow Members are wrong in thinking that a secret ballot may favour a shift away from that position; on the contrary, I expect that Members in this Chamber will demonstrate that they are not subject to any pressures when freely carrying out their mandate. As regards the remainder of the foreign reports, I agree with much of what Mr Nicolaï said and I should like to express our agreement on all the measures that bring forward constitutional reforms. In the High Representative’s actions in Ukraine we have glimpsed a sign that the initiative in that direction is being strengthened. The initiative should, however, be supported by more substantial instruments, which are foreseen in the Constitution but which might perhaps be brought forward. With regard to the neighbourhood policy, we encourage the Commission and the Council in their work. We point out the danger, however, that the measures to create a free-trade area may take precedence over the other policies. I would stress that we do not just want to create a free-trade area, and so we should be careful not to weaken the policy’s regional and subregional dimension. As regards human rights and democracy, I recommend that we negotiate a proper convention with our neighbouring countries. Such a convention should at last spell out the shared values that we so often refer to and define them carefully in formal terms, particularly for the sake of the Mediterranean countries. The convention should make those values known to the people whom they concern and it should set up joint institutions that can guarantee them. Regarding the Middle East, we must ensure that the presidential elections in Palestine give the road map a new boost and that the Israeli Government’s unilateral decisions, such as the withdrawal from Gaza, are included in the negotiations with the Quartet, so that the creation of the Palestinian state can be completed within the established time frame. To that end, this issue will have to be placed at the heart of the relationship between the European Union and the United States. On the subject of Iraq, we consider that the hoped-for turnaround has failed to materialise even after the Sharm el-Sheikh conference and that the aim of holding elections may well be jeopardised by the violent situation in the country. Finally, I call on the Council and the Commission to devote attention also to the situation in Cambodia, where there is a humanitarian emergency concerning children.

 Mr President, I am putting this request forward on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and I do not think the other groups will object. My request concerns the extremely serious situation in Cambodia, where a number of children who had been set free and entrusted by the authorities to an NGO have again been kidnapped by prostitution racketeers, while the staff of the NGO in question have received death threats. The situation is truly very serious. We have already dealt with the pressing business and I think all of the groups are in agreement with keeping Zimbabwe, Congo and Bhopal on the agenda. We do not intend to oppose those topics, but we just ask to be able to address the Cambodia issue within the debate on the preparations for the European Council, to be held on Wednesday, so as to increase awareness in the Council and Commission. We think that this would be the right thing to do, partly in view of the seriousness of the facts. Those children have been forced back into the chain of prostitution, which notoriously serves a European clientele. We therefore believe that dealing with this subject during the debate on the European Council would be an act of great sensitivity and I do not think any of the groups will object.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that Parliament will send a clear message to the European Council of 17 December, a message to open negotiations with Turkey with a view to its accession. That is the right response in keeping with the considerable progress that has been achieved in that country, as emerges from the Commission’s thorough, in-depth report. The opening of negotiations will, of course, involve a long time-frame as well as further profound changes both for Turkey and for the European Union itself. In the current situation, that seems to be the only path that can be proposed. I have heard mention of special partnerships to replace the prospect of accession if Turkey proves unable to take the Community acquis
 on board. Opening negotiations does not mean automatically guaranteeing accession to the Union, but mentioning other prospects at this point in time can only make our counterparts rightly suspicious about what the Twenty-Five genuinely want. Let us try, therefore, to be clear and transparent and to give that country a real chance. It will then be the political will of our current and future leaders, and especially of the Turkish people, that will decide the future of our relationship. Let us not give any excuse to the opponents of democracy and secularity in that country, or we may bitterly regret it. I would say to Mr Camre that my country has had the crime of honour and the annulment of the crime of rape through marriage as part of its legal system, but I would never dream of saying that it was due to our Catholic culture. I therefore ask him to rethink that point.

Mr President, we harbour great concern at the worsening situation in Iraq. The attack on Fallujah and the way in which the civil population has become embroiled are feeding the spiral of hatred, besides being the umpteenth violation of international law and the Geneva Convention. I should like us here to turn our thoughts to poor Margaret Hassan, who was brutally murdered yesterday. Both terrorism and war in response to terrorism make the prospect of pacification and democratisation of the country still more remote. We therefore call for the Union to play its part in the Sharm el Sheikh conference on 23 November and to make its weight felt, in the light of the unity we have attained, in insisting on full acceptance by all sides of UN Resolution 1546, based on respect for international law and human rights. In these circumstances, it is valid to harbour strong doubts about the real possibility of holding the elections in January 2005. The result of the US elections and the replacement of Colin Powell may give even greater encouragement to the extremists, both in Iraq and in the Middle East. As far as the Middle East is concerned, I am less optimistic, as it does not seem that Mr Sharon has conceded more to Abu Mazen during the period of his Prime Ministership than he conceded to Yasser Arafat. On this question, besides renewing our solidarity with the Palestinian people in the loss of their historic leader, we demand that the Union commit itself by political and financial means to ensuring fair local and presidential elections in Palestine, and resuming progress on the currently stalled Road Map. That would make it possible to replace, I repeat replace, the unilateral actions of the Sharon government with honest and proper negotiations, which, by resolving the more controversial issues, such as the settlements and the right of return, would lead to the birth of the Palestinian state and the coexistence of the two peoples.

Madam President, some people have stated that the war in Iraq will have favoured a rapid solution to the conflict in the Middle East. A cynical forecast, instrumental in justifying a wrong and illegal war. A forecast belied by the terrible picture before our eyes: despair in the Palestinian camp, growing terrorism and fundamentalism, crisis in the Palestinian Authority and fear in Israeli society, which gives Prime Minister Sharon the opportunity to unleash indiscriminate repression and to proceed undaunted with the construction of the wall. The withdrawal from Gaza that has been announced has by no means been said to be paving the way for the restitution of the occupied territories of the West Bank. On the contrary, it could be the prelude, via the settlement activity which is being stepped up, to the definitive acquisition by Israel of the majority of those territories, confining the Palestinians within enclaves which have nothing to do with the sovereign state to which they are entitled. The road map has not provided the tools with which to prevent the negotiation process from once more being overwhelmed by violence. The international community, and above all the Middle East Quartet, ought to draw some conclusions from all this and reflect on this fact. As for the possibility of a solution to the conflict, the Geneva negotiators, in contrast to Camp David, have demonstrated that it is possible to find dignified solutions to which both sides can agree on all the points of conflict, even on the most sensitive and thorny issues, such as the status of Jerusalem and the right to return up until the final status. The Middle East question ought, moreover, to have absolute priority in the relations between the European Union and the United States – in the hope that there will be a change in the administration there. Today we can also rely on the positive role played by some Arab countries – Egypt and Jordan – and on the improvement of our relations with Syria and the normalisation of relations with Libya. Tomorrow, this state of affairs could be very different. If yesterday Europe’s security was linked to developments to the east, today it depends on the southern and south-eastern dimension. It is also for these reasons that the Middle East conflict is not something which has nothing to do with us, but is the central issue in the future of European security.

Mr President, all the points raised by Mr Salafranca are correct. However, I would like to add another point. Paragraph three has been submitted in a previous version, whereas it should be replaced with the following wording: ‘asks the Council Presidency, the High Representative and the Commission to support the initiatives which the interested Member States are taking in this regard’. Paragraph three must therefore be amended as well. Ladies and gentlemen, I understand that it is annoying, but I assure you that we tabled the correct version of the text. I know that Mr Tajani will ask to table an oral amendment and I can already foresee that we will agree.

 President-Designate, during the hearing before the Group of the Party of European Socialists, in reply to my question on foreign policy and, in particular, on the circumstances which led to your support for the decision in favour of unilateral intervention in Iraq, you said that, being a politician and not a technocrat, you had to give an opinion and take a stand at that time. This means that, with your candidacy, you wish to help politicise the political life of Europe. You strongly and repeatedly stressed this notion, including today. Nevertheless, I am afraid that this was not the reasoning which led and motivated the governments to nominate you, because you well know that politics presupposes the development of a dialectic, with the citizens then being in a position to understand the alternatives and to assess the differences between positions, particularly when they concern fundamental issues such as war and peace. This is also why many younger generations are staying away from the ballot boxes, as they do not properly understand the alternatives that politics offers them. The matter I wish to raise with you today, however, is different and just as important. You will be aware that, on 22 April this year, Parliament adopted a resolution on the risk of a breach of the freedom of information in the European Union, and in particular in Italy. Following that vote, there has been a continued trend for media concentration in France and the accession countries, while in Italy a law on conflict of interests has been adopted which leaves control of television stations in the hands of the Prime Minister. Instead, the European Parliament hoped to see the introduction of legal instruments which would prohibit political figures or candidates from holding direct interests in the information sector. Moreover, there was the terrible news a few days ago of the two journalists killed in Russia, and you know how serious the issue of freedom of the press is in countries with which we have international relations. Mr Barroso, I therefore have a very specific question, and I hope that your reply will be just as clear. Do you intend to act on the European Parliament’s request, that is, undertake to produce a draft directive on the protection of media pluralism? Having said that you wish to give importance, prestige and autonomy to the Commission with respect to the Council and in partnership with Parliament, do you think that you can make this commitment now? If you receive a positive vote from this House tomorrow, will this matter be included in the programme that you will put forward in October?
