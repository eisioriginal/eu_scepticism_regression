 Madam President, I requested the floor in order to express the profound dissatisfaction of a number of Italian Members – most probably all the Italian Members and, I imagine, the dissatisfaction of the majority or the whole of this Parliament as well – at the statements made by President Kuçan yesterday. We fully approve his condemnation of Slovenian nazi and fascist oppression which he expressed in his speech before the European Parliament yesterday, but we cannot accept his failure to condemn the horror of anti-Italian ethnic cleansing perpetrated by the Communist regime immediately after it came to power. In particular, we cannot allow the massacre and eviction of the Italians to be described merely as a measure intended to combat collaboration with nazis and fascists, in the spirit of Potsdam and Yalta which divided Europe and from which Europe has had to regain its freedom and unity and is still in the process of doing so.  The events in question were a series of crimes against humanity in which the methods of ethnic cleansing that, tragically, have recently been employed in other parts of the Balkans, were developed for the first time. Italy is well disposed towards the Slovenian population and supports the entry of Slovenia into NATO and the European Union. We were of the opinion that the 1995 Solana agreements had provided a fair solution to the Italy-Slovenia disputes. We cannot understand why President Kuçan is putting forward fresh interpretations of past events which are totally unacceptable and harbouring unfounded fears regarding the future. Yesterday, President Kuçan issued a statement via the Slovenian Embassy saying that the controversy was caused by translation errors and that it was not directed at Italy but at Austria. Well, in our opinion, an action contravening human rights, which is a crime, is just as reprehensible whether it is directed at the Austrians or the Italians.   Madam President, I call upon you to take steps to inform the Slovenian government and President Kuçan of the profound dissatisfaction of this Parliament at his unacceptable statements, which certainly do nothing to create the appropriate climate for the negotiations on the accession of Slovenia to the European Union, negotiations which, we hope, will reach a positive conclusion.

 Mr President, the public alarm at the granting of this patent is, I feel, totally justified. In the first place, at this stage, it is in the general interest to avoid patents being issued on human chromosomes, in order not to close any doors to the endeavours of scientific research to find new treatment methods and to use knowledge gained about the human genome to improve health, which is an end that should be placed over and above the albeit legitimate protection of the economic interests of researchers.  Secondly, there is a deficiency in the law: it is not possible for the European Patent Office not to have any links with the Commission or be part of the structure of the European Union.  Thirdly and most importantly, we are considering an issue which is at the very root of our civilisation. Christianity has taught us the value of the dignity of every human being; the tradition of the left enshrines the concept that the human person, man, is not a commodity and cannot be treated as such. Well, we are now clearly running the risk of turning human beings into commodities, at least in part, and this affects the very roots of our civilisation – in terms of Christianity and also of the enlightenment and Marxism. We must be united, determined and resolute in our reaction, remembering that the embryo is a unique human being. Whatever our attitude to abortion, even those of us who consider abortion to be lawful have always agreed on one point: the right of the mother prevails over the right of the embryo, but the right of the embryo does exist. It yields solely and exclusively before the right of the mother, not before the right of a multinational to make money.

 Mr President, the situation before us arises from the Iraqi Government’s refusal to accept United Nations Resolution 1284. As things stand at the moment, the Iraqi government is not prepared to accept this resolution, and there is a real danger that when the United Nations Commission responsible for monitoring the destruction of weapons of mass destruction applies for an entrance visa it will be refused. The British and American Governments have already given it to be understood that, in this case, hostilities would be resumed. It is therefore possible that, in a few months’ time, we will have a major military clash on our hands, not just the ticking over of long drawn out hostilities as, sadly, is the case even now – the bombs continue to fall periodically – but large-scale bombings within the space of a few weeks. I feel that we should focus our attention on the possibility of preventing this from happening. I am sure that the Iraqi Government is prepared to accept Resolution 1284 – a fact confirmed by contact with the Iraqi leaders – but it needs clarification on certain points which are referred to in the Resolution. It must be made clear that, at the end of the United Nations mission, the embargo will be lifted – not just suspended, but lifted once and for all. No one will consider rebuilding Iraq if it is obvious that there will only be four months of stability, and that, after that, the embargo could be reimposed without fresh, credible reasons.  We have attempted to besiege Iraq and to force the Iraqi people to change their government through the embargo and we have not succeeded, even though we have been trying for seven and a half years. Instead of driving the Iraqis to rebel against the regime in power, the embargo has induced them to hostility towards the West, and in any case, has made them incapable of any kind of action. I feel that it would be more destabilising for the regime to return to a more comfortable situation in terms of trade, to a situation in which the people have at least some hope of happiness, rather than to continue with the embargoes which, at this stage, are not succeeding in overthrowing the regime, but are simply inflicting enormous suffering on the people and, in particular, on Iraqi children. Iraqis are not going to die of starvation. There is no famine, but there is an extremely serious health problem: the water and drainage systems have disintegrated and sewage water and drinking water mix, creating dysentery rates which send the infant mortality rate sky high. The people need more than medicine: they need us to go out there and rebuild their water supply network, their drainage system and their power stations, restoring an adequate quality of life.  I feel that our resolution should also serve to reassure the State of Israel. We must not forget that Iraq does not possess any nuclear weapons and is not likely to be able to produce any, but it is also true that if it did, its government, or part of it, would use them. We must therefore make it clear to Israel that a major concern of our policy is the defence of the State of Israel and the right of the State of Israel to exist.  We must draw up a balanced resolution which is acceptable to all the parties involved if we want to avoid the military clash which is lurking over the horizon: not a demagogic declaration, but a political proposal in which Europe takes control in order to protect world peace, exercising its key role in this area with due responsibility.  Mr President, I must confess that I am extremely unhappy that we are not going to vote on this motion today. With every passing moment, we are rushing towards the danger of a military clash which must be avoided. I called for the issue to be debated during the last part-session, and I wonder at the fact that a month passed before our socialist friends managed to reach a consensus with us regarding a motion, even though there should not have been any difficulties as we agree on the basic points. Nevertheless, I realise that it is also important for us to achieve as great a consensus as possible in order to give our governments a firm basis. However, I call for no more time to be wasted, for I would not like us, as has happened in the past, to once again have to discuss what we should have done to preserve peace once war has already started.

 Mr President, I withdrew my motion in spite of my conviction that we are mistaken not to take the opportunity to intervene, now that it is time to do so and we have the possibility of achieving a general consensus on the matter. I would stress that this is the second time that the adoption of this motion has been deferred and I hope that events do not reach crisis level before we are able to attempt to influence the situation to bring about peace.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I read the Ludford report with great interest and I would like to compliment the rapporteur on her remarks on Austria and the Austrian situation. However, I would stress that these remarks are out of place in a report on human rights. When we hold a debate on Austria, when we draw up a document on the Austrian situation – if Parliament judges it appropriate so to do – then we might even be able to give Baroness Ludford the task of drawing up a document which we will debate together. These remarks have no place in a document on human rights, as they should not be using up the time allocated to the Baroness’s report, and so they have acquired the bitter taste of political exploitation of a very serious issue such as human rights.  I would like to say something else on the subject of this report, regarding the right of Europeans to their own identity. Throughout the document, the identity of Europeans, of the European nations, is not once referred to in a positive sense but always as a possible framework for xenophobia and racism. I am a practising Christian who is sure of his beliefs: now, is this a reason to accuse me of xenophobia? On the contrary, xenophobia is more likely to be caused by a decline in religious convictions. Religion per se
 is a factor which promotes fraternity. I am a staunch Italian patriot, so, according to paragraph O of this document, I could be accused of xenophobia. This seems to me to be indicative of a cultural attitude which encourages xenophobia, for it encourages fear of globalisation, which prompts many local communities to become inward-looking and refuse dialogue, dialogue which takes identity into account.  We must make it clear that Europe does have a cultural identity, based on our Greek and Judo-Christian heritages and on enlightenment, which enters freely into dialogue with other identities. A multicultural Europe which does not include European culture would lead to disaster and its decline. This is not a not a question of black or white cultures: there is no connection between colour and culture. Culture is based on values, not colour.  There are many issues related to xenophobia and racism, but these must be dealt with by the local communities. It is not our place to define labour market quotas, or police or any other labour market quotas, and if we were to do so we would hinder integration, not encourage it. Lastly, are we really of the opinion that all those who are not in favour of completely uncontrolled immigration are racist? And do we really think that the Constitutions of all of our nations are racist because their criteria are different from those espoused by Baroness Ludford? These aspects of the report need to be evaluated carefully and many of them changed, or we will find it hard to obtain a general consensus in this Chamber.

 Mr Solana, it has been said many times in this House that prevention is better than cure. Of course it is, but there is no reason why Europe cannot equip itself with the means to intervene when prevention proves unsuccessful.  In any case, it is prevention that I would like to discuss today. War is threatening to break out again in the Gulf. As you know, the Iraqi Government has refused to abide by United Nations Resolution 1284, and this is likely to lead, within the next six or seven weeks, to a refusal to issue entrance visas to the committee monitoring the destruction of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. If this happens, the United States’ Government and the British Government have given it to be understood that they will resort to military intervention. A visit to Iraq and meetings with the Iraqi leaders and leading figures, particularly Mr Tarek Aziz, convinced me that there is actually a possibility of persuading the Iraqi Government to cooperate in enforcing Resolution 1284. However, the responsible authorities of the Western countries need to make it clear that, once the mission of the United Nations committee has been successfully completed, the embargo will be lifted and normal trade relations will be able to be resumed.  I would like to know what you and Europe are doing, Mr Solana, or what you intend to do in the near future, to stave off this threat of war. Today, we have the chance to prevent it; tomorrow it may be too late. I would also like to know whether, in this context, it would not be possible to do something to induce the Iraqi Government to take a humanitarian step and to release some information regarding the 615 missing Kuwaitis, or to set them free if this is within their power.

 Mr President, the internal self-regulation of Parliament is one of the fundamental bulwarks of its independence. Anything which affects Parliament’s right to self-regulation affects a core element which allows it, or rather enables it, to perform its sovereign functions as the people’s representative. This is found in the constitutional history of all parliaments. This is the reason why specific precautions are introduced to prevent this sovereignty being limited in any way. If we take an impulsive, majority decision on a matter of this kind and interpret the annexes without taking into account how these agreements affect fundamental issues, we will in some way contravene the basic rationale, the objective of the legislation we are addressing.

 Mr President, I must thank my colleague Mr Laschet for this report, which is far-reaching and envisages great opportunities, but we must also devise a way to move from the current situation towards realising these opportunities. First of all, I must say that I had a great experience of collaboration with the United Nations when I was working with its Vice-Secretary General on a report that I was completing, within the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, on protecting children’s rights. I feel that the proposal made by Mr Laschet represents the first phase of a reform that the UN must, however, face up to. Having left behind the rationale of Yalta and power blocs, we must make the case for increasing multilateralism. We must make new nations responsible at world level, without removing time-honoured instruments through which world peace has been promoted; and the right of veto is one such time-honoured instrument. The Security Council must, in any case, be enlarged, and we then need to consider new permanent members, without the right of veto. These could include the European Union, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Germany, Japan, India, Italy and South Africa. Furthermore, we also need to expand the number of members elected to the Security Council and then reform the Agencies to make them more operational on the ground. We need to speed up the promotion of human rights and the affirmation of the principles of democracy. We need to assume that the United Nations intends to protect people, since it invokes the concept of the nation and not that of the state, and the concept of the nation presupposes the protection of the person. This process of protecting people needs to start as a matter of urgency because terrorism is hot on our heels: today it is in the guise of Al-Qaeda 
and Bin Laden, tomorrow it could have a different name. Of course, a reformed NATO could be the international police force that the UN might need. Division and exclusion certainly give rise to war; union and the philosophical concept of union instead promote important goals of peace.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to express my thanks to Mr Söderman for carrying out the role of European Ombudsman when it was set up and for building it up, brick by brick. I would like to welcome the new Ombudsman, who is taking on this valuable heritage. As Mrs de Palacio quite rightly said, the previous act is hard to follow, and so we now need to continue to raise the legal and cultural status and, above all, raise public awareness of the Ombudsman. I must say that we received proof of how wide this awareness is when, at the time of the election of a new Ombudsman, a large number of candidates were put forward to the European Parliament. Parliament then chose Mr Diamandouros, who will have our full support in the process of developing and consolidating the role of the Ombudsman. We certainly need to promote this role in the Member States – my country and many other Member States have no national ombudsman, unlike many other countries – and in the accession countries too. We are also considering giving our support to the forum initiative, proposed by the European Ombudsman and mentioned by the rapporteur, the Earl of Stockton. The forum should be open at all levels – local, regional and national – and should provide a great opportunity for communicating and exchanging opinions on the running of the institution. I am extremely pleased that the European Ombudsman has made another proposal too – to include among his responsibilities the enhancement of the system of non-judicial means of redress, not least in order to give substance to relations between the institutions and the citizens. What we need to do now, as I will mention again, given that I am speaking three times today, is to strengthen the bodies which defend and protect citizens’ rights. I believe that Mr Diamandouros will be able to accomplish this task. He has shown very willing and his previous experience as a national ombudsman will stand him in good stead. I would therefore like to express our thanks and our support for his future work.

Chairman of the Committee on Petitions.

 Mr President, ladies and gentleman, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs González Álvarez, for all her input in the Committee on Petitions and the great understanding that she showed in dealing with all the Members and with me personally, in her work in the Committee on Petitions. She has now chosen to take the office of minister in the Asturias regional government, and we congratulate her on this appointment and wish her every success in the work that I am sure she will carry out with her usual sensitivity. I would also like to pay tribute to Mrs de Palacio, and to the Commission as a whole, for relations between European Commission officials and the Committee on Petitions have gradually been normalised and regularised, with the members of the Committee on Petitions becoming increasingly involved in Commission issues and with the officials working on the issues raised by the public ceasing to use bureaucratic language. This is testimony to the growth of the institution of petitions, the increase in citizens’ awareness in approaching this body to make their problems known, in other words in the increase in awareness of European citizenship and of the European dimension that is gradually filtering through to the citizens. The statistics and data provided by Mrs González Álvarez show that the number of petitions, and the number of people signing them, has increased dramatically. This growth in the number of petitions and in the number of signatories shows the extent to which this House and the European Institutions are providing increasing guarantees where citizens’ problems are concerned. The citizen is dwarfed by the gargantuan nature of the institutions and of globalisation. I believe that we certainly need to make the right to petition a reality and to make proper use of the institution of the Ombudsman and anything else that can help to increase the stature of the citizens in the face of the huge undertakings of the present and the future. We have also carried out a mission in Italy – the country currently holding the Council Presidency – calling for strengthening of this body, not least as part of the overall programme of the European Presidency. We met the minister, Mr Buttiglione, the deputy-ministers, Mr Caldoro and Mr Nucara, and the vice-president of the Chamber of Deputies, 
Mr Fiori, but, most importantly, we met with the four presidents of the bodies which, to some extent, take the place of a national ombudsman, that is Professor Rasi for privacy, Professor Ranci for energy, Professor Tesauro for competition and Professor Cheli for communications. We asked them to focus on the fate of the citizens in their areas of competence rather than resolving conflicts between companies and between institutions. Indeed, very often, these institutions are distracted by the need to resolve conflicts between powers. We, on the other hand, have an issue to resolve that is greater than conflict between powers: ensuring that these institutions are genuinely representative of the citizens. There must, therefore, be continual checks to monitor the adherence of the institutions to the mandate conferred on them by the citizens, and this will only be possible if we succeed in strengthening the role of these bodies designed to protect the citizens. I would like to add very briefly that, as the Committee on Petitions, we need to create an organic system within Parliament for consultation with other Committees, and this will probably be achieved by means of an internal parliamentary regulation. Furthermore, there should never be any conflicts of competences; rather, we must work together and cooperate. As regards own-initiative reports, I would like to say briefly that perhaps we should amend the Rules of Procedure in this regard too, for the own-initiative reports decided by the Conference of Presidents should certainly reach plenary, having already been processed at Committee level with the appointment of rapporteurs, the drafting of the report, and so forth, and they must not be blocked by any organ. If there has to be a filter, I believe that this should be applied as early as when the proposal to draft such a report is being considered. The third and final point relates to the restructuring of the Committee on Petitions. I am not in favour of nominalism. If the Committee on Petitions is not to remain as it is but is to perform other tasks, then it is absolutely necessary to provide for a restructuring of its secretariat; otherwise, this will not be possible. If the secretariat is to remain, with the same structure, then the Committee on Petitions cannot deal with anything else.

Mr President, I, too, should like to thank Mr Bolkestein, for whom I have no questions. I would merely like to retrace our steps in this debate for a moment to, when talking about petitions and the gargantuan ventures brought about by globalisation, I made an analogy: the citizen and the giant. There is an enormous discrepancy between the citizen and the giant. Parliament should now ask itself what it can to do protect citizen’s rights. This is a situation – as Mr Perry has made very clear by mentioning a case in point – which affects many citizens who have gone bankrupt. There are a large number of trials under way in the United States and some in Europe too with many in the United Kingdom. How can we not wonder what the solution to this situation is and how it will develop? How can we not ask Parliament, how can we not even ask ourselves what we should do to resolve this situation? Lloyd’s of London is a large institution, which still enjoys worldwide credibility, but clearly, at some point, something happened, there was some error, because, otherwise, there would not have been this proliferation of cases reported by the citizens. There are now those who are calling for a committee of inquiry to be set up and those who oppose this, but it is not a problem that must be resolved in court, not least because we do not want to start legal proceedings, because we are not qualified to start proceedings and because we do not want there to be adverse parties. All we want to do is respond to the requests of the citizens, because this is our mandate: a mandate of representation that we must fulfil completely by representing both the citizens and institutions such as Lloyd’s of London. I therefore do not intend to criminalise anybody. Instead, I want to understand why this situation exists. If the Commission’s reply, when it arrives, is not comprehensive, then only an inquiry which we can carry out without any pressure will reveal the crux of the matter, the gap, the loophole through which this great mistake, which has caused so much harm, managed to slip.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I sincerely welcome the Italian Presidency’s programme and believe that, with the necessary caution, with the humility that marks the Italian people and with the almost unique ability to place our inspiration and intelligence at the service of the many, we shall be able to make port in the new Europe. The true aim of politics must be the noble government of people’s needs, in a society that is constantly changing at an ever-increasing rate. To do this one needs great political sensitivity to manage the technostructure and oppose technocracy. The society governed in this way consists, in simple terms, of a vast majority of ordinary, good, simple people: men, women, young, old, children, of varying abilities, who work and live anonymously but are driven by good and simple feelings of solidarity and love. This is the important Europe that we have to address, by moulding the economic structure to the growth of these ordinary people, who should not have to live with the insecurity and instability in which the globalised economy would trap them. The Euro-Atlantic partnership with all the Americas is not just an economic and political need or choice; it is a cultural fact that arises from our common roots and shared values. It should be strengthened, it must grow, not least through the transformation of NATO into a tool of international policing at the service of a reformed United Nations, going beyond the rationale of Yalta. A last thought concerns world poverty. There is too much poverty, and it requires aid. Therefore, in the discussion on the Union’s financial perspective, we should boldly and decisively set ourselves the target of increasing our contribution to 2% of GDP, because opening up our markets and reforming our institutions is not enough for the international agencies. Mr President-in-Office, I hope our Italian Presidency will have a very great ability to listen, because that is the only way it will be able to celebrate the Constitution of the new Europe, and also to satisfy the Commission under Romano Prodi, a staunch champion of the Community method and of the Europe we want.

Madam President, I would like to express my thanks to Mr Oostlander for his report, and to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Yiannitsis, and Commissioner Verheugen. I feel that the Oostlander report is very well-balanced and frank. The European Union is a Union of shared values. Thus, all the countries which have become Members in the past and those which are joining the Union now share these values and, in order to join the Union, have brought their institutional, political and economic systems into line. This is the bottom line. It is not the European Union which wants to become part of Turkey but Turkey which wants to subscribe to these shared values. We must respect the diversities which make up the rich heritage of the European Union, but the limits are defined by respect for the Copenhagen criteria, for the principles of democracy and the rule of law, and these criteria and principles must not just be proclaimed but enforced and lived. I would venture to say that the countries which intend to share our European culture may become part of the European Union. Turkey is applying to join. We are not opposed to this in principle. We are waiting for the country to complete the process of adopting our cultural values. The Erdogan government must be encouraged in the process of moving Turkey closer to the values of the European Union. The ideological NATOists believe that Turkey’s role in NATO could be its trump card when it comes to joining the European Union. That might have been so in the past, but we now believe that NATO, with the participation of Russia, will gradually have to assume, with a slightly more effective contribution from the European Union, an international policing role, serving a United Nations which has been reformed to safeguard human rights and democracy in the countries of the world. I hope that Turkey will be able to act on these proposals, to resolve the Cyprus issue and to establish good neighbourly relations with all the countries on its borders, resolving longstanding conflicts.

 Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Commissioner Verheugen, who has been most assiduous in following the enlargement process. I would also like to thank Mr Brok and Mr Wynn – I agree with what Mr Wynn said in his speech – and the Greek Presidency. Every moment is history in the making but not all moments are equally important, and this is one of the more important events. This is not empty rhetoric: I am expressing my awareness of the responsibility we bear in saying ‘yes’ or ‘no’ in this matter. We are gradually restoring Europe’s integrity and unity, reintegrating and reunifying its culture, traditions, peoples and children. We have not yet completed this major building project. Yesterday, we received a visit from the President of the Republic of Macedonia, and our thoughts are already turning to the Balkans, to that region in which we helped to achieve peace and which is starting to establish democracy, the rule of law, the welfare state, an economic fabric and international relations. Then Moldova and Ukraine are potential candidates, assuming that Bulgaria and Romania will join the Union in four years’ time. The process will require more work where Turkey is concerned, for Turkey’s idea of society will have to be brought into line with ours. Lastly, we cannot fail to consider Russia, with which the European Union will have to have an increasingly close, organic relationship. All the seeds we are sowing will take root if the Community method prevails. The European Union will only survive and develop if, I reiterate, the Community method prevails in the Convention. The most recent position adopted by the Budget Council is evidence of a completely opposite trend and is to be deplored. If the egotism of the Member States leads to the intergovernmental method prevailing, Europe will suffer a heart attack, a setback, but history will continue regardless. I therefore call upon the ten new Member States to stand shoulder to shoulder with Parliament in advocating a different line from that taken by the governments of the current Member countries, which have a pessimistic view of the Union. Dear people of Slovenia, dear people of the other nine acceding countries, help us to build new European institutions in which we can all be equal and develop with full respect for the dignity of the individual.

 We feel Mrs Sandbaek, Mrs Martens and Mrs Ferrer’s work is satisfactory, considering the different starting points. We should always be mindful of our ability to produce texts which require respect for human rights, inviolability, self-determination and responsibilisation of the individual as a priority. The violent practice of abortion should therefore be excluded as a general means of family planning. A regulation whose objective is to protect health cannot contradict itself and attack life, the supreme good of the individual from the moment of conception. Another general consideration is countries’ approach to these instruments, which reflect the responsibility that every State, every community and every individual should feel to protect life. With the help of the donor countries, the governments of the developing countries must provide information, education and appropriate instruments and encourage responsibilisation of the individual, to free people from ignorance, taboos, superstition and the archaic practices which go hand in hand with underdevelopment. My last point concerns the issue of the subordination of women to men. The culture of the hierarchy of force must be eliminated once and for all during the Third Millennium. The Third Millennium is characterised by the culture of information and knowledge and, therefore, must provide the conditions for free exchange between minds. Women must be able to dialogue with men without being affected by any form of sexism.

 Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner Patten, I am sure we are all aware of the responsibility that the world, including the European Union, has towards all peoples to ensure development, progress and peace. I find the behaviour of those veteran pacifists who claim to be anti-war on ideological grounds, setting themselves up as champions of peace, infantile, as if all the others were warmongers. We are all for peace, we are all against war, we are all against weapons of mass destruction. Therefore, how do the professional pacifists think the weapons of mass destruction can be destroyed if Saddam Hussein is not making the sites and stores known to the UN inspectors? It is irresponsible to make out that the world is divided into those who are for and those who are against peace. The civilised world, all civilised people, all people aware of their own dignity, are against war. That is why I am asking you all not to draw a line through Parliament, for the distinction would, in this case, be purely for manipulative ends. I am one of those who consider that the role of the UN must be strengthened and that international policing measures must be decided by the United Nations, despite the need for far-reaching UN reform. However, I am also convinced that we must leave behind the Yalta approach once and for all and that debates on the dangerous situations threatening the world must include all the States which have a significant role to play in the world. We can show our gratitude towards the US in many ways, just as the US can show its support for Europe by not exporting egotistical, blinkered economic short-sightedness. It is in the common interest, the interest of both Europe and the United States, to have the closest possible relationship with Russia. It was a wise move to include it in the Nato Council, and we must continue this forward-looking process and involve Russia in world decision-making. This is important for European integration, which must continue with the entry of the Balkans into the Union one by one and the evaluation of all the other accession applications. I would like to reiterate that the Arab League’s decision to approve the UN resolution is significant, just as it is important for States governing Muslim peoples to approve it, for we need to isolate the fundamentalists, the extremists, the totalitarians, the imperialists. We need to tell the world that Islam is a religion worthy of respect and that terrorism, which is the product of fundamentalism, is to be unreservedly condemned and combated. We cannot now exclude the possibility of an international policing operation to disarm Saddam Hussein, but this must be decided by a UN decision, after every avenue suggested by the inspectors that does not involve bloodshed has been tried, as General Morillon too has called for. I believe, moreover, that we have to thank the United States for having kept the spotlight on the Iraqi question and for now deploying a powerful military machine which is ready for action. The situation is responding perfectly to the US treatment, and armed conflict may well be avoided, if Iraq creates the necessary conditions for peace. Europe has therefore been dependent on the US thus far and must find its own role in the world, not just through the creation of a rapid reaction force but, above all, through effective coordination of foreign policy. We must strive to discern Europe’s role, on every question, not just Iraq. To this end, I believe that we must invite Ariel Sharon, who has now been placed in a strong position by his electorate, to attend an international conference on the Middle East, in order to try and find a peaceful solution for all the regions which need, first and foremost, to abandon the culture of hate and encourage mutual respect and recovery of the States. Europe’s current role, then, is important and will become even more so if we succeed in influencing North America as well as Russia with Western culture, so that it will commit to respect for freedom and, at the same time, to upholding the principle of solidarity. Our culture will have to face immense challenges in the future, and it will win through if it is fully aware of its responsibility to mankind.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Brok and all the rapporteurs for this report. We are coming to the end of the first stage of European reunification, and this morning has given us a timely, encouraging glimpse of the future. Reunification will continue until we have welcomed into the embrace of the Union or into another, essentially just as effective body, all the countries which share the European culture and its basic values. It is imperative that we continue with this process if we want to help to establish the values of democracy, freedom and equality throughout the world, to make every day a day of greater peace, peace which is increasingly understanding of others and increasingly shared with others. I understand the issue of Europe’s borders, but the borders of our society will be defined by the heritage we can offer the world: the more we share our culture, the wider our borders will be and the more citizens there will be who opt to share our ideas for the institutional, political and social organisation of the Community. Together with the other accession States, Slovenia is important because it represents the gateway through which the Balkan States who will share our multicultural, multiethnic and multifaith society will have to enter in future. I believe that the political goal we have achieved must be matched by progress in upholding human rights, the achievement of economic and social standards and the combating of corruption and crimes whose levels are still very high. It is genuinely important to discard the individualistic mindset and realise that we are part of a larger body, which we must essentially complement and never stubbornly disregard, where everyone has a part to play in the endeavours to achieve common goals. I hope that the Convention will be able to draw up a proposal which makes the instruments of democracy operational, which will help other areas of the world too and bring peace, prosperity and progress to mankind.

 Madam President, I would like to start by saying that I welcome the working method used to address this Parliamentary resolution. I would now like to ask a question: who are the targets of terrorism and what is the logic behind it? It would appear that terrorism targets human beings, and it therefore contravenes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and cannot be based on religious or ideological considerations. If today, the entire world has taken up the fight against terrorism, it has done so because terrorism violates precisely that which the entire world – all the States and all the citizens – has subscribed to in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Well then, when we produce definitions of terrorism, we specify, for simplicity’s sake, the groups which carry out terrorist activities. It would be shame, however, if this were to induce us to fall down the slippery slope and lump together with these groups what we define as religious movements, only very small parts of which may be involved in terrorism. If we have to take a step forward, we must do so not least by sending out a message as the European Union, calling for monitoring of the penal systems of all the States which have signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, for, very often, the penal systems which have produced their own internal definitions of human rights are not consistent with the Declaration. This is what I wanted to say in my speech, for I feel that we have to overcome this period of conflicts and be more proactive in working for the good of the whole world.

 I feel that Mr Duff’s Report is right to focus on the importance of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and its future status, for it must be included in the Constitutional Treaty which the next IGC is to draw up at the end of 2003. It must be one of the bases for the conversion of the pillar structure of the Union to a Community structure. As Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, I have noted the increase in the citizens’ requests for protection of their rights, which shows that their relationship with the European institutions, particularly Parliament, is constantly improving. I support the establishment of the ‘European Ombudsman’ to safeguard the financial interests of the Union, of the European arrest warrant and of the mutual recognition of judgments and the work of Europol – institutions which require greater coordination and organisation and a more specific horizontal and vertical division of competences. After the elements of Community law relating to criminal law, I believe it is important to address the civil law elements too and, in particular, the relationship between the citizens and the legal systems of the Member States, some of which need to be reorganised, including the administrative and civil justice systems of my country. Without altering the distribution of competences between the Union and the Member States, the Union needs to play a positive role allowing the citizens to benefit fully from the ‘right to justice’. Moreover, the Union must reflect on the issue of the relationship between the citizens and the Court of First Instance with a view to making European justice tangible for the citizens.

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Söderman, Commissioner Liikanen and the rapporteurs of the two major reports tabled on behalf of the Committee on Petitions. I would like, in particular, to thank the European Ombudsman, together with whom we have witnessed within the Committee on Petitions a fruitful experimental encounter between different legal traditions, with progress made towards the achievement of major goals in terms of the development of procedures to implement 
the right of petition and make it a reality, with reflection on the Interinstitutional Agreement and, most importantly, as far as the Ombudsman is concerned, with the development of the network, with the realisation on the part of the regions of Europe of the essential nature of the relationship with the citizens which is established through the regional ombudsmen. I feel that this work must continue because the right of petition is related to the citizens’ awareness of their European citizenship. The more the citizens become aware – and they are becoming aware – of their European citizenship, the more they enter into dialogue with the European institutions. While many Members have focused on the way that petitions can contribute to the supervision of the European institutions, I would like to emphasise precisely the relationship of trust created between the citizens and the European institutions through the right of petition, and, therefore, the recognition of these European institutions, whose competence is wider than that of district, provincial, regional or State bodies. We, the Committee on Petitions, are continuing this process to make the right of petition efficient and effective, and we 
associate the initiative with the Perry-Kessler report, which for us was fundamental and in which we established points which we are gradually endeavouring to implement. . We are currently attempting to create a relationship between the Parliamentary committees, for they have to be aware of what the citizens are saying in their petitions so as to be able to decide whether to fill a legislative gap or whether to amend or reinterpret a directive. That is why we requested and received own-initiative reports, precisely in order to illustrate the citizens’ problems. Lastly, I would point out that the Convention on the Future of Europe is in progress, working towards drawing up a constitutional treaty. In view of that, this is an important opportunity, particularly to ensure that greater importance is attached to the views of the European citizens.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, it is never out of place or superfluous to mention European citizenship, not least because we very frequently expect the citizens to be Europeans and then fail to treat them as such. Indeed, the citizens are starting to feel European, and this is happening as they begin to enter into dialogue with the European institutions. However, there is more to citizenship than that: in a way, it confirms the citizens’ place in this European dimension, which they must feel both contributors to and responsible for at this time of great impetus and dynamism. We feel that the level of participation in the European elections is low and declining steadily, but we wonder what we are offering the citizens of the Member States as part of this European package. We are not offering them the mutual right to study in different Member States, we are not providing facilities to resolve language difficulties, we are not providing a labour code, we are not – as Mr Coelho, who has produced an excellent report, pointed out – providing free movement, we are not recognising qualifications and, therefore, we are not recognising a right to work, and we are not recognising the right to health. I am saying this on behalf of the citizens, for I receive the petitions sent by the citizens to the European Parliament’s Committee on Petitions, in which they describe these major areas of intolerance within the Member States of the Union. I would next like to point out a major contradiction: we have achieved Schengen, which is a milestone which could benefit the whole world, particularly the countries which are still troubled by wars over territory and border conflicts, but we are preserving the right for the Member States to expel European Union citizens from one Member State to another. How is it conceivable that the right of expulsion still exists when it runs counter to Schengen? We can expel citizens outside the Schengen area, not within the same territory. Well then, I feel that we should all make every endeavour to start building Europe at the level of the citizens, starting precisely with the recognition of status which the Charter of Fundamental Rights placed at the centre of the European project and which must be reproduced in the Treaties. If we do not succeed in doing this, however many conventions we produce we will never manage to build Europe, especially when one country – I am referring to Ireland but there may be many others, including my own – has refused to recognise, to sign and to ratify the Nice Treaty and when three Member States have refused to share our experience with the single currency. The road is long: we must all strive to place the citizens at the centre of the Europe we are building.

 Thanks to Commissioner Diamantopoulou, whose assessment of the situation I support, we are, at last, starting to talk about Somalia. We were unable to tackle the issue for a long time, not least because the situation did not allow it. Now, with this Transitional National Government in place, we can discuss Somalia, in the knowledge that we still have quite a long way to go along what is an extremely tortuous path. I believe that Somalia is the only country in the region which is in this situation. We must therefore call, using the intermediary of IGAD, for the Nairobi Conference to take place as soon as possible, with the participation of not just the representatives of the Transitional National Government but all the other representatives and all the leaders controlling the northern and southern regions of the country as well. Indeed, if we do not manage to involve most of the representatives of these territories, we will fail in our purpose. I feel that thanks are due to Djibouti and Kenya too, which have being acting as mediators for a long time. They have now been joined by Ethiopia, which wields great influence. It is to be hoped that these three countries will succeed in coming up with several proposals to make to the leaders meeting at the Nairobi Conference, which will result in a genuine peace process. We must, of course, endeavour to put forward a solution based on respect for the country’s integrity, although the decision-makers will have to decide whether to give some of the regions of the country specific forms of autonomy. The problems are immense, as the Commissioner said. We need, first and foremost, to demilitarise and disarm the people. That is the main objective. We need to clear the territories of mines and, most importantly, we must isolate the terrorist groups which are present or have established themselves in the country. Moreover, we must define an institutional structure and set in motion a process of introducing democracy and respect for human rights. As the Commissioner stressed, we must be motivated by a spirit of national reconciliation, which fully involves all the parties concerned. Furthermore, the issue of refugees must be addressed: refugees must be able to opt to return freely to their country without risk to their safety. Another serious problem is health: there is a health crisis in this country which requires an urgent response. If, as I think, these are the key goals for the Nairobi Conference, it is essential that the conference takes place without delay, before the month is out if possible, for that will allow the European Union to launch aid programmes. These must be more effective and more rapidly implemented than previous programmes. If these goals were achieved, Somalia would be in a position to dialogue with the other countries in the region with a view to setting in motion a vital economic process. Moreover, it would appear that there is hope of the democratic process being launched in Eritrea too, and this makes it possible for the European Union to use the instruments laid down by the Cotonou Agreement to provide an initial structured programme of aid measures for the entire region. I believe that precisely this regional element can create cooperation within the region, encouraging countries such as Somalia, which need help and comprehension but which also need to take courageous decisions which will ensure the full participation of all the regional authorities, to follow the example of other countries in the region.

 Mr President, after the dark period of colonialism and dictatorships in the developing countries, I feel that it is positive that we are talking today about elections in these countries, even though their social and civil structure is weak, as is the concept of democracy. It is difficult to distinguish between the parties, given that every culture and every society needs to select its own representatives. I do feel, however, that we must reiterate the need for transparent elections, for we must promote the development of democratic awareness and culture just as we must promote the growth of civil society. Moreover, through the instruments available to us, the Cotonou Treaty and the ACP/EU Joint Parliamentary Assemblies, we must propose systems and methods of democratic control, ensuring they are appropriate to the current level of civil society in those countries. We will be able to move forwards if we succeed in getting across the message that democratic growth, the safeguarding of human rights and the creation of a pluralist State – and therefore of consensus within a pluralist society – will enable this country to grow, for it needs so badly to be actively included among the world’s civil societies.

 Mr President, before saying anything else, I would like to express my total mistrust of the present leaders of Eritrea and my absolute condemnation of their actions. The situation in Eritrea is extremely critical, and we now have a better understanding of what prompted this people to go to war against Ethiopia. However, the solution reached was not a mutually agreed solution but a concession obtained from Ethiopia, which won the war by military force. Moreover, Eritrea brought down a regional resolution at the ACP Assembly of November 2001 by refusing to discuss the issue of relations between the two States. With regard to the Italian ambassador, we should ask why he was expelled. He was expelled for the ‘crime’ of conversing with Eritrean civil society rather than just with the country’s leaders. Therefore, we must be resolute in addressing this situation, first and foremost in order to free the Eritrean people from the ruling power. I feel that maximum effort and total commitment on our part will be needed to bring growth to civil society, to create a world that is civilised and not excluded from the assembly of the civilised nations. That the Commission use the Cotonou Agreement to this end is not just necessary but, given the situation, its responsibility. We cannot allow the situation in this area to persist.

 Mr President, the debate on the future of Europe must be conducted in a very responsible manner if it is not to end in failure, as happened with the intergovernmental method at Nice. We must recognise the legitimacy of the European citizenship of the citizens of the Member States, for this, too, will help to bring the European institutions closer to the citizens once again. Today, we have to take into account the way the interinstitutional organisations’ systems have developed, and the more sophisticated this development becomes the more it widens the gap between the citizens and the institutions. When the institutions work properly, problems do not arise, but when they do not work properly – and the number of petitions we receive is evidence of the considerable gap between the institutions and the citizens – the citizens are wronged by the institutions. Our positive response must be to strengthen the institutions which safeguard the rights of the Union’s citizens. The Committee on Petitions has been forced to issue an extremely critical opinion on the Commission’s proposals on good governance, for it has found no reference in them either to the European Ombudsman or to the Committee on Petitions’ role as the institutional body which safeguards the rights of the citizens, who indeed petition it to uphold their rights. 
The proposals for good governance do not appear to contain any significant element that might succeed in bringing the citizens closer to Europe. This endeavour could be said to be effective in theory but, in actual fact, to have no genuine impact. Lastly, we hope that it will be possible to make the obscure role of the Council clearer, at least by advertising the institution’s sittings when it is legislating, to avoid the impression of it being a huge black hole. I recommend the points made in these reports to the other European institutions, for I am sure that Parliament is the only body with democratic legitimacy.

 Mr President, I firmly condemn terrorist acts. Terrorism is abhorrent, whatever adjectives you use to describe it and whatever ideological label you attach to it. I too feel that we must establish very close cooperation with the United States and form an extensive world-wide alliance of all the countries that wish to be part of it to combat terrorism. The world-wide anti-terrorism alliance must certainly address military issues to ensure safety, but it must also address all the possible forms of terrorism which exist, which range from financial to banking terrorism, and from economic, food contamination and environmental terrorism to electronic terrorism and terrorism in the form of computer hacking. The debate between the European Parliament, the OSCE and the WEU, which met at the assembly of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, focused largely, on the one hand, on the need to speed up the process of democratising those countries and, on the other, on the upholding of human rights. These are the two fundamental pillars for eradicating poverty and underdevelopment through the rational use of economic resources. Henceforth, the European Union must stipulate the upholding of human rights and the implementation of democracy as firm conditions in all its external relations. This stipulation is fixed and unconditional because it guarantees the protection of the dignity of every citizen in the world. The European Union must encourage respect for every religious faith and, at the same time, it must require all faiths to condemn and abhor terrorist acts, to make a clear distinction between civil society, which is free to practise any religion, and terrorism, which cannot claim to have any religious justification. I support the idea of convening a Mediterranean Forum condemning terrorism, supporting the Middle East Peace Process and reinvigorating the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. Finally, Europol and Eurojust must, together, become effective European tools, concentrating on enhancing the European corpus juris
 and thereby creating a basic legal reference framework which will serve as the basis for European civil, penal and administrative law.

Mr President, as this debate comes to an end I would like to thank all the rapporteurs – Mr Bösch, Mr Perry, Mrs Almeida Garrett, Mrs Sbarbati, Mr Camisón Asensio – and all the Members who are committed to the institution of petitions. I also would like to thank the European Ombudsman who carries on the fight in defence of the citizens from his observation post. We are working together, of course, and we too are working for the citizens of Europe, because they have a champion in this Parliament, the most authoritative institution in that respect. Thanks to the European Commission’s particular sensitivity, as demonstrated by the preparation behind the officers’ explanations of their reports in the Committee on Petitions, we have made great progress. However, more and more European citizens are presenting petitions on personal, social and environmental problems. It is our duty give them increasingly relevant, detailed, and satisfying responses. Their petitions illuminate the path the Union still has to travel to ensure peace of mind for our citizens. Of course we do not want dull and amorphous standardisation in the European Union, rather we think above all that cultural differences should be harmonised by turning those differences into the true wealth of the institutions. We have entered a season of reform, defence and strengthening of the institution of petitions and we believe that season of reform will give us the power to defend the citizens and, at the same time, make the European institutions better known to our ever-growing population.

Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Brok for preparing this report on enlargement. The decision to open an enlargement process highlights the great, long-term vision of our predecessors. However, this great vision and long-term perspective is not being matched by an adequate financial and budgetary initiative. I feel that Member States’ contributions need to be revised in order to include our new commitments and needs even before 2006. Like everything new, enlargement is causing uncertainty among the public. We must reassure them from the economic as well as political point of view, particularly where the structural and cohesion policies are concerned. Wealthy Europe must be more generous and the governments must be the vehicles of this generosity. With regard to Slovenia, I have already had the opportunity to thank Mr Volcic for his valuable contribution and his report. In my opinion, the accession of the candidate countries will be our first opportunity to tackle the issue of relations with the Balkan countries after the war. The first, absolute necessity which the European Union must establish and confirm, where it is lacking, is multiculturality based on recognition of and respect for differences, all differences whether physical, intellectual, ethnic, religious, economic or other, to prevent any more ethnic or religious wars. Europe and the European Union must demand reciprocity from all the countries with which they sustain relations or for which they are finalising solidarity programmes in the area of multiculturality, for this dimension is the basis of all the democratic structures of the States. I hope that, in the future, Slovenia’s situation will be mirrored in all the Balkan States and bring peace and prosperity to the war-torn communities. Lastly, I feel that, for the European Union, the economic element of globalisation is not about maximising profit and its social element is not about standardising societies, but globalisation is about the readiness to harmonise existing differences.

 I would like to thank Mr Perry, Mrs Kessler, the other members of the Committee on Petitions, the Legal Service and the entire Secretariat, whose work has contributed to the preparation of the valuable document on the future of the institution of the petition. The institution of the petition is still the only legal instrument which places the citizens in a direct relationship with the European institutions, and it is therefore the only means of bringing about the Europe of the citizens, who want to recognise the validity of something which is in the process of being created that will serve to further improve the quality of their lives. Relations between the citizens are founded on law, and, therefore, the definition of an institutional forum which safeguards the corpus of European law becomes important in terms of giving due value to the diversities which are the European Union's assets. The Committee on Petitions has the privilege not only of receiving the citizens' complaints and hearing them directly, if the citizens are present in person, but also of being the epitome of the Parliamentary representativeness which is the very essence of democracy. It is my opinion that, during this legislature, we must guarantee the European citizens who assail Parliament with their questions a Parliamentary initiative which not only has moral value but is also effective for the purposes of correct interpretation of Community law by all parts of the institutions, whether central or peripheral. Without prejudice to the specific, essential competence of the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance 
and the Court of Justice, the European Parliament must, in future, fully discharge its role of political legislator, developing effective legislative instruments through proposals to be incorporated into the Treaties as well as other avenues. A further measure could be the involvement of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, in order to progress to the practical implementation of this new instrument which will protect the citizens and their rights more effectively.

 I would like to start by thanking the Commissioner, for this report has come back to the Committee on Development and Cooperation a number of times and this has contributed to enriching the debate within the committee. I would also like to thank the Chairman of the committee and all the group coordinators, and all the Members who have contributed to the preparation of this report, taking up, with great sensitivity, my invitation to make this report a document which compels broad consensus and a broad majority in Parliament, reflecting all the positions expressed by the European Parliament. Lastly, I would also like to thank the draftspeople of the other committees: Mrs Carrilho of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mrs Haug of the Committee on Budgets, Mrs Lucas of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and Mrs Sörensen of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, who have contributed their opinions to this report. The report is based on a number of fundamental principles: restoring the balance of nature in order to protect the environment; protecting the food chain as a way of protecting the ecosystem; developing a self-sufficient, sustainable economy; restricting exploitative industrial monocultures; and then, restoring the balance of nature also in terms of anthropological progress and responsible relationships between man and woman, adult and child, workers and elderly people, based on a unit of society made of a man, a woman and children. Another principle is that of responsible, self-administered development, as a cultural factor, of the need for, and the development of a higher standard of living: projects which are self-created, in order to promote the development of local culture and help people to look beyond customs originating from local culture; then awareness of the role of the institutions and the need to involve the private sector 
in programmes encouraging development; lastly, great, very great attention to the world of children, who, in the political world, are an invisible group of society with no voice or rights; moreover, a powerful role for women, recognising the role that women have always had in society, starting with the family and the work place. It was with on the basis of these guidelines that the debate on the European Commission's communication took place. We found the debate somewhat simplistic compared to what ought to be the European Union's perspectives within this world of development. And so, since it has not been possible to produce a coherent report on such a complex work, I feel simply that I must say that the conditions of poor people are worse today than in 1960, that is 40 years ago, that the number of children in school has fallen and that people are not being considered as individuals, as individual people, but that all the poor people in the world are being lumped together as one economic statistic. Debt is also an issue which can and must be tackled, provided that we succeed in monitoring the States' budgets in order to reclassify budget items and dedicate them to the eradication of poverty. Similarly, rural development must be improved, properly valued and increased, apart from anything else to offset the rush to build huge cities. Then, with regard to conflict prevention, I feel that this issue has been dealt with more or less exhaustively in Mrs Carrilho's opinion on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and that it too can be tackled through the regionalisation of development policy. I would stress one further point. It would appear that there is a tendency to attempt to deal with the issues of development and eradicating poverty by entrusting this task to the multinationals. I do not feel that the multinationals are the right organisations for the task. Rather, the role of the NGOs, who should have a direct relationship with 
the peoples of developing countries, should be strengthened. In conclusion, I do not know whether this report will enable us to deal with these issues, but I do know that there are many children, women and men in need of our help, and we must protect them.

 Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the two rapporteurs, Mrs Muscardini and Mr Naïr, who have produced sound, high-quality reports on the future of the Mediterranean policy. I feel that a boost needs to be given to the political, cultural and economic aspects of the Mediterranean policy: because we must increasingly consolidate democracy and the parliamentary system, because we must expand the borders of the rule of law, because we need to realise the importance of protecting human rights, because we need cultural exchange promoting mutual awareness of societies, particularly where Islamic communities are concerned, because we need to create multiethnic, multiracial, multireligious and multicultural societies and therefore reassert the principle of respect for minority cultures as part and parcel of democracies and emphasise the importance of peace in the daily lives of the citizens of the southern side of the Mediterranean, thereby excluding from the cultural process all radical or fundamentalist behaviour and all hate, which leads to conflict, massacre and war. Moreover, 
commercial interexchange is important for Europe, and it is also important to be able to provide and guarantee vocational training and adequate financial instruments, and also support and advice in respect of the currencies of these countries, for, apart from anything else, the free-trade area will then have to become a euro zone. This is what we expect. However, I feel that the European Union needs to do an about-turn for, in my opinion, the current line is to withdraw from the expected prospects and commitments. The cutback in the MEDA programme,
 for reasons which I see as excuses, and delays in the partnership processes are alarming. Declarations of principles have been followed not by action but by delays in action. We must prove wrong the theory that enlargement means a decline in interest in the Mediterranean. We call for decisive reversal of the trend; we also call for resolute commitment to the Mediterranean peace process between Israelis and Palestinians, and not just between these two peoples but in the entire area, to tackle the problems of the Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Iran, so that all this can bring peace and tranquillity to that region of the world. Let us therefore make our Mediterranean a sea of peace – for it used to be a sea of culture – where children, women and citizens can trade and move freely throughout the area.

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Cashman for his report, which is enriched by the opinions of Mrs Maij-Weggen, Mrs Hautala, Mrs Malmström, Mrs Theato, Mrs Thors and Mr Andreasen. However, I think that he is referring to all the institutions except the Council, for the Council is a black hole in the European Union. The Council is the unknown on the far side of beyond. In my opinion, a step has been taken towards making it possible for citizens to avail themselves of their right to information and knowledge. In all probability, the advent of electronic data will eventually bring the citizen this possibility, providing information automatically without the citizens having to make an – albeit legitimate – request for it. 
Furthermore, I feel that, as the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman have requested, we also need to endeavour to outline clearly the institutional and bureaucratic stages in the process, defining the responsibilities which – rightly – still lie with the institutions, therefore without separating the different responsibilities within the organisation. I have mentioned responsibility precisely because the information has to protect the citizen from errors of public administration. If this were not so, we would merely be talking about a desire for knowledge, pure and simple. However, the citizen's right to defend himself against the public administration means that information must be provided. One last point: information cannot be made available, that is, the right to information, the right to protect the citizen from public maladministration cannot be provided if the procedures are not made simpler and more comprehensible, if the number and complexity of procedures is not reduced, because, although the citizens are familiar with the complex procedures, these procedures are the antithesis of transparency and deny the relationship between the citizen and the institution, which ought to serve as a channel for improving the quality of life of the citizen.

 Mr President, the President-in-Office's speech seemed to me to be rather on the biased and general side, but I found that Commissioner Patten's speech was realistic and focused well on the different problem areas. We therefore now need to discuss the different issues. Firstly, tomorrow marks the start of a major UN session where 159 Heads of State will be present. In what form will the European Union be present and at what level? I feel that it is extremely important for us to establish ourselves at the very highest level and to make our presence felt. A discussion on priorities should include economic policy, but our economic policies are all inward-looking and only concern the interior of Europe. It is also just as important not to let go of development policy, for that creates stability and peace and has to target Russia and China as well as developing countries. In my opinion, it is not right to ask us to choose between the Balkans and developing countries. The Member States need to take these factors on board. Working towards constitutionalisation of the European Union, one benefit of which would be institutional citizenship in international bodies, the creation of a European diplomacy as per the Galeote report, the cultural concern which we must take on board in order to avoid fresh incidents of colonialism, the support and valuing of democratic processes which have also been established in certain countries such as Iran, and the regulation of relations with NGOs, which could become the operational arm of the European Union – these options could all contribute to an effective political initiative for developing countries, an initiative which would assert the supremacy of European civilisation in terms of a quest for solidarity to improve quality of life and bear witness to respect for human dignity, celebrating it in every corner of the world.

 Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the European Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, the two rapporteurs, Mrs Lambert and Mrs Thors, all the members of the Committee on Petitions and the Secretariat. We started from the premise that the purpose of the institutions is to serve the citizens and that, therefore, any breach of the citizens' rights will lead to a loss of confidence in the institutions. We are currently required to create a complex, comprehensive, harmonious, functional legal framework, and we must therefore also create judicial mechanisms such as the Charter on Rights, a body of law establishing criminal, civil and administrative law, the agreement procedures for the mutual recognition of judgments passed by Member States, Europol and the sectoral agreements, the establishment of the European Fraud Investigation Office as a tool for investigating abuse of the law, the likely institution of the office of European Public Prosecutor which should be the investigating office of the Court of Justice, the separation of the careers of judges responsible for giving rulings and investigating magistrates, and the separation of criminal, civil and administrative responsibilities: all these are instruments which advance the progress of the European Union. Yesterday's framework agreement is a milestone in this sense. Finally, we would like to request that, in a similar way to Parliament in the codecision procedure, the Committee on Petitions may be permitted to present its own justification for certain decisions, and we call for amendment of the Treaties in order to streamline the entire legal system and existing legislation.

 Mr President, I want to thank the Co-President of the Joint ACP-EU Assembly, Mr Corrie. It was no easy task to draw up a report on a complicated forum like the ACP-EU Assembly.  In this speech, I will confine myself to addressing certain points I consider fundamental. I believe the European Parliament should call for the Assembly to become truly parliamentary, urging all ACP countries to send members of their national parliaments as their representatives, so as to strengthen their own democratic fabric. My next contribution to the debate is to turn my attention to globalisation and the WTO, which is seen by the ACP countries as an enormous danger to their development. I do believe the ACP countries need a transition period, but they also need support in the context of the new logic of regionalisation of aid, not only in agriculture and fisheries, but also in the exploitation of mineral and underground resources, some of which are being exploited, with slim economic returns to the ACP countries themselves. Thirdly, the European Parliament – through a joint working group within the Joint Assembly – must make a major effort to achieve stability in ACP countries’ budgets through the selection of budgetary items to permit economic and, above all, social development, and by monitoring income and fiscal policies in force in the ACP countries. We must put the people of the ACP countries first in our relationship with their rulers, who need to be fully aware that development aid from the European Union is intended for the people and not for the oligarchies that handle all the internal and external resources in some countries. Fourthly, and finally, the prevention of inter-ethnic conflicts between States must be our constant concern and to some extent this can be achieved either through a strong and authoritative diplomatic offensive or with the proposals I have set out.

 Mr President, Mr Monti, the reform of competition rules calls for a commitment by the European Union, not only in the light and as a consequence of changes which have taken place through the years, but also with a forward-looking view to the Union’s enlargement. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, for his commitment and I welcome his thoughts. Moreover, I would like to say that I appreciate the remarks and observations that Professor Tesauro, Chairman of the Italian Competition Authority, sent me, and which I am sure Mr Monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration.  Our real concern is undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market, and, above all, to achieve consistency between the different national markets. As things stand, there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the English, Italian and French markets. There is a large degree of state protectionism in the French market which is not found in the English market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in Italy. Another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement, which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment. In my opinion, we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic structure should be placed: small and medium-sized businesses, which bind the European economy together, and social protection, which Europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy. Safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade, pure and simple, and a system for 
improving people’s quality of life.  A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands, all of which must be protected. We ought therefore to consider creating two focal points 
of an external market by instigating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries, precisely so that their economies become less peripheral. I hope – and I thank Mr Monti for this –
 that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed.

Mr President, for a Christian, requesting a moratorium on capital punishment and its abolition is not just a duty or a proper act, but an ethical choice made out of respect for people who have done wrong and who can and must redeem themselves. We are opposed to deaths caused by man’s interference, such as abortion and euthanasia.  A guilty verdict is irrelevant to this request. We would ask for this moratorium even if the person were a confessed criminal and there is all the more reason for us to do it 
when there may be reasonable doubt about their guilt. If, on the basis of formal documents on civil rights, we ask for humane conditions in prisons, there is all the more reason for us to oppose the death penalty and we cannot therefore understand how countries that are recognised as civilised can still have cruel and uncivilised regulations.  Finally, I would like to stress that, taking the modern view of studying the consequences of criminal judgements, the punishment should fulfil a rehabilitative function, enabling the citizen who has done wrong to take up his place in civil society again. Knowing these values, we are firmly reasserting our request for a moratorium on capital punishment for the two condemned citizens in Virginia and the Yemen.

 I would like to thank my friend and the rapporteur, Mr Valdivielso de Cué, for the wonderful job he has made of mediating and reconciling the various yet justifiable interpretations of the validity of the new instrument for economic cooperation with the New Independent States and Mongolia. It was a difficult job but the competence and tenacity of the rapporteur means that we can approve this measure.  The new financial programme for the development of the New Independent States and Mongolia that is replacing TACIS is bringing in mechanisms that are more precise than the previous ones. Partnership and competition between the partner States in gaining funding encourage them to play an active role and they aim to enhance existing professionalism and therefore to create a ruling class which will be based on meritocracy. The need to continuously monitor the implementation of the plans, as laid down in the document, protects the European Union from the blatant attempts at fraud noted in the past, and aims to put in place obvious and thus verifiable initiatives. The choice to undertake visible interventions complies with the condition of emphasising the positive role of the European Union with regard to the wreckage left by communism ten years ago, and puts to the test the effectiveness of the western democratic method with regard to the failed dirigisme
 of the past.  It will be necessary, as anticipated, to carefully consider interventions in the civil, economic and social areas of the various New Independent States and Mongolia using two parameters: the solution of the issue of humanitarian intervention and social and economic marginalisation, without privileges and ranking, and the assessment of strategic civil, economic and social value with the aim of bringing the peoples of the new Independent States and Mongolia closer to the European Union. Therefore, we need to proceed with the interventions in order to create a security framework between, on the one side, the new Independent States, and on the other, the European Union, so that we can establish ever greater peace and stability.  An essential demand that the European Union must make is that the new Independent States respect human rights, so that democratic principles and cultural, religious, political and ethnic pluralism will increasingly take root, in order to improve people’s quality of life. The possibility of suspending the intervention in the unhappy event of a crisis occurring is certainly a strong deterrent which will lead the new States and Mongolia to seek a negotiated solution to disputes, thereby turning them into everyday political dialectics.  The European Parliament should debate and approve the new instrument that is replacing the TACIS programme, even if currently Russia, the largest of the new States, is the focus of a just European Parliament initiative that has suspended the technological cooperation agreement following the war begun against Chechnya. But the Russia question is not solely about this: it is a large country experiencing an extremely serious political, economic and social crisis and it is preparing for presidential elections. It is a large country undergoing a difficult transition and, in my opinion, it should not be left to its fate nor should it be isolated in punitive terms; instead, it should be helped and reassured by means of a close political and economic relationship, even if the political relationship is dialectic and the economic relationship is competitive.  Russia needs a lot of help from the European Union, based on caution, encouragement and when necessary, objections, but without the possibility of breaking off relations, which we actually need to intensify, in areas such as the creation of a new legal-administrative system which will do away with any temptation to behave improperly.  It is up to us to create the conditions for peace, cooperation, support, aid and partnership, and we must put the onus on the New Independent States, Mongolia, and above all, Russia, to make sure they deserve our help, by complying with the objective conditions of defending the fundamental principles of citizens and governed communities.
