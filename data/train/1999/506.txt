Mr President, Commissioner, having followed the information given to the public during the Prestige 
crisis and the speeches in the parliamentary information committee, I believe that the vessel sank for two reasons: firstly due to its terrible seaworthiness, and secondly, due to the bad decision by Mr Aznar’s Spanish Government authorities, which, rather than seeking a place of refuge, chose to send the damaged vessel to areas with rough seas, with waves more than six metres high, until it broke up and sank, causing the biggest ever oil slick in Europe. I think that the fact that the vessel was sailing in an unsuitable condition was the responsibility of the owner, the captain, the oil company that owned the cargo, but above all, it was the responsibility of the classification society ABS, whose inspection conducted in the port of Dubai four months before it sank had not been correctly carried out according to the audit subsequently conducted by the International Association of Classification Societies. ABS also inspected the ship Panam Serena 
that exploded in Porto Torres, Sardinia on 1 January this year. I have therefore already tabled an amendment urging the Commission to carry out more effective monitoring and to audit classification societies and their inspectors regarding the quality of their work. It also urges the Commission to put a stop to any collusion or conflict of interests that there may be with owners, charterers, oil companies, etc. There needs to be greater transparency in this and also in the International Maritime Organisation, which receives a large proportion of its budget from States that are known as flag of convenience States, but where the real control is in the hands of other States, some of which are European.

Mr President, on 11 March, all we Members of the European Parliament came to this House horrified by the news of the terrorist massacre in Madrid at 7.30 in the morning. Please allow me, firstly, to express my condolences and solidarity with the victims and their families, and also to reject all forms of terrorism. That morning I had felt particular anguish, added to so much blood and so much anguish, at the realisation that the attack could have been the work of the ultra-radical Basque fanatics of ETA. At midmorning, I heard a Belgian television station point out the possibility that it may have been carried out by Islamic terrorists. At midday, when an oral amendment was presented to the House declaring 11 March the European day against terrorism, the Member presenting that amendment blamed ETA. By then there had already been the early call to the police by the witness who saw three hooded men in Alcalá de Henares and the van containing detonators and verses from the Koran had been found. And there had also been statements denying the attack and the involvement of ETA from the spokesman of Batasuna. It was already known that the attack had not been by ETA and, despite that, pressure was applied and the involvement of ETA was artificially maintained in the Resolution of the European Parliament and in that of the United Nations Security Council. For all of these reasons, I believe that the Spanish Government of Mr Aznar’s Popular Party was trying to evade its responsibility for having participated in the invasion of Iraq, against the wishes of the Spanish citizens, of the United Nations and international law, and once again took the opportunity to blame ETA and nationalists for the problems which authoritarianism and intolerance such as theirs has created in Europe and in the world. Neither did the discovery of a rucksack with detonators and a mobile phone used by Islamists do anything for their argument; nor the repeated communications claiming that the Al Qaeda organisation was responsible for the attacks. The Popular Party continued to blame ETA, by means of personal calls by Mr Aznar to the main daily newspapers and by the Foreign Minister to Ambassadors, and also by means of the ineffable public appearances by Minister Acebes. To make matters worse, millions of European citizens and governments of other States were shamelessly deceived by the Popular Party Government, who did not care a jot about the risk of further attacks and deaths in other cities, provided that the Spanish people did not know until after the elections of Sunday 14 that the horrors suffered in Madrid were a response to the unjust and illegal war in Iraq. Fortunately, the Spanish citizens were able to demand the truth and get rid of the government which tried to deceive them. And let us hope that we can convince ourselves soon that the best recipe for combating terrorism is to put an end to injustice and poverty, of which there is so much around the world, and in that way we will be able to live in peace.

Mr President, I am speaking as a result of personal comments during this debate relating to my abstention on 11 March when an oral amendment was presented proposing that 11 March be named European Day against terrorism. I must clarify that I am not against an international day against terrorism, nor a European day against terrorism. If I had been against, I would have voted against; I abstained, because in the justification of that statement a false and manipulative element was introduced, which deceived European opinion with regard to the identity of the perpetrators of those tragic and horrific attacks. It was also stated that the Basque Government has not been able to beat terrorism in twenty years. I must point out that Mr Aznar, the Popular Party Government, promised to put an end to terrorism within five years; eight years have passed and now, rather than one form of terrorism, we have two. We must begin to understand that it is not possible to beat terrorism through police and judicial measures alone. The key is that we must put an end to injustice and poverty. The key is to respect the identity, culture and religion of other people and to have equitable international legislation, that we respect everybody and not just when it suits certain interests.

Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission has presented us with a new modification of the guidelines for the trans-European transport networks, in which it proposes extending the number of priority projects which will be declared to be of European interest. We do not agree with some of them, but, above all, what we cannot accept is that, in parallel, a quick start list should be proposed to the Council, which would be restrictive, with the justification that it is necessary for the Community's growth strategy. If we want the priority projects to be implemented between now and the end of 2006, we propose the establishment of a funding bonus for works certificates genuinely executed within this period of time. This would really contribute to development, and not restrictive measures such as the quick start list. We welcome the inclusion of the motorways of the sea, but we must view them as cross-border routes so that they can have access to as much Community funding as possible. Finally, for those cases in which States have difficulties funding a certain project of European interest in time, we would request that interested autonomous communities and regions which have their own resources be permitted to present proposals to implement them, and also that these communities be able to access aid for funding trans-European transport networks included in all lines of the Community budgets.

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we have heard that the main points of divergence in the Intergovernmental Conference are the composition of the Commission – whether or not there should be one Commissioner per Member State – the Presidencies of the Council and the redefinition of the qualified majority for the adoption of decisions in the Council in accordance with a majority of States and a majority of population. Do you not believe that representation by all States in the Commission helps greater numbers of citizens to identify with European integration, and do you not believe that positions such as that of the Spanish Government, intended to create blocking minorities on the basis of the third Nice criterion – the number of votes in the Council – may push other governments to evade restrictions and to move towards a two-, three- or more speed Europe?

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I will naturally not be supporting the executions carried out by the Cuban Government. But I must point out that there are many executions in the United States and also many selective assassinations in Israel. They are happening on a daily basis.

 Mr President, I certainly agree with promoting a European growth initiative. Nonetheless, I cannot accept the restrictive interpretation of the so-called Quick Start List. A list of priority projects already exists. These were endorsed at the Essen and Dublin European Councils, and the Commission has proposed a second enlargement. I believe all these priority projects should have an equal chance of access to Community aid. The challenge ought to be getting the projects under way at the earliest opportunity, not cutting the number of projects. In my view, one option could be setting up some sort of a bonus system involving an extra payment for projects or parts of projects certified as having been completed over the next three years. That would be far more effective than an a priori
 cut of the list of projects on the basis of the likelihood of their being launched or completed. Certain sections of high-speed railway line could be largely completed between now and 2006. The Vitoria-Dax line is one of these, yet it does not appear on the Quick Start List. I am also of the opinion that the so-called maritime highways should be deemed cross-border projects on condition that they link ports in two Member States.

I wish those Irish citizens still alive who remember being ruled from London were listening to this debate. Ever since the European Union was created, peace has been one of its key objectives. Over a hundred lecturers and professors of criminal law from all over Spain have felt bound to publicly expose the collapse of the rule of law instigated by the present Spanish Government. I believe this cannot be ignored if the common objective is to maintain peace and integration. Peace and integration in Europe have to involve respect for democratic principles. Are you satisfied that the Spanish Government is upholding democratic principles and the rule of law?

 I would like to congratulate the Irish Presidency and the Council on all the efforts they are making to resolve the Kosovo conflict and other conflicts around the world. The Council and the Institutions are very concerned about what is happening in the world. They try to offer solutions and contributions to promote peace in the world and resolve conflicts. The European Union is also involved in helping to resolve the conflict in Northern Ireland. This even includes providing financial support for the peace process. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, would it be too much to ask that some small efforts might be made too to help resolve the political conflict in the Basque Country, which is also part of the European Union?

Mr President, Commissioner, owing to the bitter experience of the sinking of the Prestige
, the Executive Commission is presenting us with a proposal for a modification of the Regulation establishing the European Maritime Safety Agency. We are in favour of increasing its competences, so that it can provide support in the field of marine pollution – accidental or deliberate – and in the field of civil protection, and so that systematic inspections can be carried out of the safety systems of ships and in port installations. We are also in favour of the Agency participating in the procedures for recognising qualifications in the maritime professions issued by third countries, to which I would add the power to approve devices which verify compliance with the Marpol rules and others, in order to prevent the waste from oil tanks or bilge oil from being dumped in the sea. Specifically, we believe that the European Agency must be provided with all the economic, human and material resources necessary to be able to carry out these functions properly. Firstly, it must have an emergency plan for cases of marine disaster which covers all coasts, from Gibraltar to Russia, and which can be deployed as required in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, the North Sea, etc., including plans for dealing with the waste resulting from collection operations and the cleaning of fuel oils. It should also have a sufficient fleet of rapid intervention ships and specialised rescue ships, also with the capacity for pumping and transfer of fuel from any ship which finds itself in difficulties. And naturally it should have qualified personnel to verify the efficiency of control procedures and the application of safety rules and the prevention of pollution in European ports and ships which sail through Community waters, not just those which land on our coasts. I would like to thank Mr Mastorakis for his report and express our support for the Commission’s proposal, although we would have liked to have gone a little further.

Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to this matter of the Protocol for 2003 adding to the International Fund for Compensation of Oil Pollution Damage established in 1992, which is in the form of an intergovernmental organisation, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, which I represent as rapporteur, was in favour of adopting the proposal for a Council Decision authorising the Member States to sign, ratify or accede to the Protocol. The FIPOL Protocol 2003 extends the maximum amount of cumulative funds available according to the various international agreements to 750 million special drawing rights, which, at the current exchange rate, is equivalent to 930 million euros. These funds are provided by shipowners and companies that receive oil transported by sea, to compensate for environmental disasters and victims of spills caused by accidents. One year after the Prestige
 accident, however, it is still difficult to assess the damage caused. A new report by the World Wide Fund for Nature shows that 3 000 kilometres of coastline were affected and calculates the damage to be around 5 000 million euros, in other words, five times the FIPOL Protocol for 2003 would be needed to deal with all of the damage caused. We therefore continue to call for a European Fund in addition to all the existing international funds, particularly considering the huge amount of oil traffic on our seas and the existence of areas such as the ‘Costa da Morte’
, or the ‘Coast of Death’ in Galicia, which is one of the places where there have been the most maritime accidents in the past, along with other black spots such as the Calais straits, etc. We would also like to express our dissatisfaction at the deadline for this Protocol to be signed being extended to the end of June 2004, as agreed by the Council and the Member States, rather than retaining the original date of last December. If another accident were to take place during the first six months of this year, the cover would only be around 250 million euros, which is more than concerning. I would like to congratulate Mr Gil Robles on his report and I hope that the Commission will continue with its proposal for an additional European fund, because it is needed.

Mr President, the Community of Europe was born out of a desire to achieve peace and prosperity, a wise and two-fold objective, as it is not possible to achieve one without the other. One of its fundamental pillars is social and territorial cohesion, in other words, making all citizens genuinely equal by combating imbalances and inequalities in existing wealth and opportunities. In two months’ time the Union is going to be enlarged with the accession of 10 new Member States and some 75 million citizens. Its wealth will be far below the current average of the Europe of Fifteen and if we hope to continue to maintain our two-fold Community objective, if we hope to overcome the inequalities suffered by these new Europeans, we cannot contemplate allocating fewer public resources to this end; rather, we should step up our efforts to help. In this respect, I must condemn the fact that in recent years there has been a reduction in actual Community expenditure, payment appropriations in relation to the gross national income, while the latter is decreasing in constant terms due to inflation. In other words, we are allocating fewer resources to developing the Community, and yet there are some, such as the signatories to the well-known ‘letter of the six’, who want to reduce them even further. I support the Commission’s proposal that there should be no reductions in future.

Commissioner, as you will be aware, there is a priority project, one of those approved at the Essen Council, on the trans-European networks, relating to the high-speed South-Europe rail connection, and one branch of this project is intended to link the French city of Dax with Vitoria: Dax in the region of Aquitaine and Vitoria in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country. Both the region of Aquitaine and the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country wish to promote this project and face difficulties in terms of understanding and application on the part of the respective central governments of the French and Spanish States. These two regions wish to move it ahead and I am trying to ensure that within the European Union this cross-border cooperation can be accepted. I would therefore ask you the following specific question: is this instrument, which you have told us we may possibly have after the summer, going to relate just to European regional policy funds or can it also be extended to European funds for trans-European transport networks and any other type of actions with Community resources?

Mr President, in 2002 in Lisbon the European Council proposed the objective that within ten years the European Union should be the most dynamic and advanced economy in the world, generating employment, social protection and well-being for all the citizens. To this end, it was established that various economic reforms were necessary, as well as a strengthening of research and social cohesion, but nevertheless, in almost all the Member States we are seeing constant examples of relocation of companies whose owners, generally multinationals, are seeking greater profit margins by reducing the manufacturing costs of products, establishing their industries in countries with cheaper workforces and, sometimes, with fewer environmental controls. This creates unemployment in the Union and reduces our wealth and our capacity to achieve the Lisbon objectives. In the face of this unstoppable dynamic caused by globalisation, our reaction must not be to try to compete in order to bring our costs into line with those offered by less developed countries, on the basis of sacrifices on the part of our workforce or of our environmental requirements. Our approach must be to strengthen our human resources, education, training, technological development, research and knowledge. Only in that way will we continue to maintain our competitive advantage and promote and retain cutting-edge companies and sustain the high level of social well-being, protection and cohesion we enjoy. The Galileo project, which we are debating today, is a good example of our taking the correct path. Together with the European Space Agency, the EGNOS programme, and hopefully also ITER, it creates a launch pad so that Europe can be in the leading group in terms of the most important challenges humanity is going to face during this twenty-first century, that is to say, taking advantage of our atmosphere and outer space in a manner which is sustainable and respectful of nature. And since the Earth and the universe belong to all of us, we fully support the idea of Galileo being open to cooperation with third countries such as China, India, Brazil and others, as well as the negotiations with Russia and the United States on satellite navigation. And also that our Galileo transponders be used to assist the existing maritime rescue systems and cover the needs of transport, telecommunications, the environment, agriculture, fisheries and, above all, people. I would like to congratulate Mr Piétrasanta on his report as well as the Commission, Parliament and finally also the Council, for promoting the Galileo project.

Mr President, my question referred to the articles of the Treaty which oblige all of us – the Council, Parliament, the Governments and also the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission – to ensure compliance with human rights. You do not wish to give me an answer, but I would like to remind you of something which I imagine you will know much better than me. If I remember rightly, in Ireland, before you achieved independence, you had a provisional status, which led to a great conflict within your society between radicals and moderates. You resolved that situation by consulting the Irish citizens, that is, by means of a referendum. We have a situation in the Basque Country which is also difficult and worrying, and which is creating great tension and violence. We are asking that it be the citizens who can give their opinion and decide, but the Spanish Government is preventing this. It is also threatening and changing the laws in order to imprison those who advocate this referendum: a consultation of the citizens, which is the most democratic thing imaginable.

Mr President, Commissioner, as Mr Poignant points out quite rightly in his report, back in 1989 the Commission presented its proposal for a European register of ships, known as ‘Euros’, and the European Parliament recently approved the Sterckx report resulting from the Prestige
 accident, calling for this possibility to be examined again. Being aware that the Member States do not currently want to surrender their identity at sea, but also of the advantages of all our ships displaying a European symbol, I proposed the idea of the symbol of the European Union appearing in one of the corners of the flags, the ring of stars on a blue background. I believe that my British colleagues in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism were offended by this. I would like to clarify to them that my idea does not violate their Union Jack. A flag has four corners and theirs has three available. I believe it is very positive and it has great synergy for all of us that European Union ships should be identifiable in all the seas of the world. (Applause from certain quarters)

Mr President, we have just seen a spectacular failure in European integration on the part of the Heads of State or Government, who have not been sufficiently statesmanlike to see and preserve the collective interests of all the citizens. I have often had to hear disparaging descriptions in this Parliament of the historic democratic nationalist traditions, such as the Basque nation, when all we want is to safeguard our identity and our culture and are prepared to share our laws and political competences with the other Europeans. To this end, not only are we calling for recognition as historic nations, but also a role in the democratic decision-making processes. It is not we, but certain irritating State nationalist traditions, which are slowing down Europe, as in the case of Mr Aznar, who only thinks about how to block decisions in order to impose his views on others, rather than thinking about how to build a stronger, more prosperous Europe, united in its diversity. I am convinced that, in order to move forward, the Union must cease to be dominated by State governments, that is, by executives, and become a genuine federal union, in which it is the citizens and their representatives, we Members of the European Parliament, who determine the Constitution and other Community laws. It is time to leave behind intergovernmentalism and to move towards becoming a full political entity, a supra-State with common laws for all the peoples and nations of the continent or at least for those who wish to build a common future based on dialogue, trust, understanding amongst equals and good for all.

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am delighted that Saddam Hussein is to be tried for his violations of human rights, and that he and all dictators who commit crimes in the world should be prosecuted. Today is World Day of Peace and, to celebrate this event, the Pope has said some interesting things, including, amongst other things, that in order to combat terrorism, repression is not enough, and he also said that decisions relating to measures to be applied to States must be adopted within the framework of the United Nations. Do you believe that the invasion of Iraq is in line with the words of the Pope on this World Day of Peace? I hope you have understood my question.

Mr President, my question related, firstly, to whether the invasion of Iraq has demonstrated that terrorism cannot only be combated through repression – and we should ask the Iraqis who they consider to be the terrorists – and, secondly, to whether the decision has been taken within the framework of the United Nations or within another very particular United States framework.

Mr President, we are debating the regulatory framework for future contracts and tripartite agreements between the Community, the States and regional and local authorities. I would like to stress how necessary it is for the intra-State administrations to collaborate, increasing subsidiarity, in order to achieve the objectives which we have set in the majority of programmes and projects stemming from the European cohesion and environmental policies, and also in order to guarantee sustainability. I am thinking of the FIFG funds and programmes for the fisheries sector, or LEADER + for agriculture for the target regions of FEDER or the URBAN and Interreg projects, amongst others, in which the participation and responsibility of the territorial bodies is so essential. I am also convinced, however, that the fact that a significant proportion of the important Community resources which are budgeted for are not used – the so-called RALs – is due to the fact that the regional and local autonomous governments, which execute the majority of projects, have not so far been able to participate in the early phase, either in the drawing up of policies, or in the adoption of strategies, or in the identification of legal obligations prior to drawing up of the respective European programmes. It is time to put things right, to come down from Mount Olympus and to share decision-making with the other institutions which are closer to the reality on the ground and the reality of the citizens.

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for your reply. Certainly I am in favour of respecting the idea that a minimum stock of all possible species of fish should be maintained in order to guarantee their survival and continuity, and the fishermen themselves are the first to have an interest in this resource not being exhausted, since it represents their way of life. That is why I raised the question of whether, while respecting the fishing effort, while respecting the maximum catches laid down, it would be possible to also authorise financial aid for the renewal of fishing vessels which, as a result of their specific characteristics, cannot have less than 400 GT. I am grateful for the information you have given me, but I do not know whether this covers the needs for the modernisation of the fleet for all types of fisheries. In this regard, I would like to stress that we cannot treat seafaring workers as second-class workers. The renewal of the fleet is something vital not only for the survival of companies, not only for the environment, but also for safety and the working conditions of workers.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I must begin by congratulating Mrs Miguélez Ramos on her splendid report. I must also reiterate that I am in favour of the broadest interpretation of the concept of maritime security. Consequently, I welcome the fact that the regulation before us today does contain the preventive measures required to deal with potential risks of all kinds. Such measures should not apply only to passenger vessels. Ships transporting containers, chemical products, gases, oils or other hazardous cargoes must also be covered. It is now the first anniversary of the tragic incident involving the Prestige
. That tanker ended up at the bottom of the sea, having caused the worst maritime pollution and environmental damage on record. Further, the thousands of individuals who demonstrated yet again last Sunday in Galicia believe that the scale of the damage was so great because those responsible at government level in Spain grossly mismanaged the crisis that arose on the vessel on 13 November. This all confirms the urgent need to put in place security plans to ensure future crises can be dealt with a minimum guarantee of success. It is also important to monitor application of the security measures and train teams through practical experience and simulations involving staff responsible for the safety of ships, ports and both international and domestic maritime transport. We shall support Mrs Miguélez Ramos’ report, because we believe there is an urgent need to adopt all possible measures to prevent further disasters like the one involving the Prestige
.

Mr President, Commissioner, I cannot agree with the aspects approved in the conciliation meeting between Parliament and the Council with regard to the Directive on the liberalisation of the port services market. I find it unthinkable that anybody should be prepared to risk security in airports by establishing private free competition and more than one service provider for air traffic control. Similarly, I believe that for reasons of port traffic safety, pilotage, towing or mooring, or even loading, must be provided by a single body, providing each service, which guarantees adequate coordination of all its staff. In this regard, it is notable that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has already approved a law in the Spanish Parliament which allows for self-handling for this type of service on the part of any shipping or brokering company and takes it for granted that this crazy liberalisation will be approved by this European Parliament. I hope this is not the case and that the Spanish legislative is more prudent in the future and does not move forward ‘like those from Pozas’, as we say in Bilbao.

Madam President, in the proposal for a Regulation on trans-European communications networks it is noted, as in the case of other networks, that there has been no progress in the implementation of the projects of Community interest as a result of the lack of funding, either private or by the Member States concerned. In this regard, forgive me if I leave behind telecommunications and comment on the planned South-East European high speed railway, where it is surprising that the Vitoria-Irún-Dax Atlantic branch, with a link to Bilbao, has been removed from the Commission’s final report, according to the requirements of the European Council, despite the fact that the Basque Government has made a financial commitment to this line and has been prepared to build it since February 2001. Furthermore, this project can be in operation from the outset linking the French and Spanish States, via Irún, since there is already an international European gauge track throughout the French network as far as that point. For these reasons, the fact that this Vitoria-Dax branch is not included is not comprehensible either strategically or politically and I would call publicly on both the Council of Transport Ministers and on the Spanish Commissioner, Mrs Loyola de Palacio, for it to be reinstated.

Mr President, I would like to talk about the way in which a temporary committee has finally been approved to investigate the effects and consequences of the unfortunate Prestige
 accident off the Galician coasts. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has made great efforts to prevent this committee from investigating everything that happened in the days preceding and during the unfortunate incident. We finally have the committee and I hope it can shed light on all of this. I would like to insist, however, on something: despite all the measures this Parliament has wished to implement in the European Union to prevent any similar accident, if today we had a case such as the Prestige,
 we would run the same risk; because the Prestige 
was not entering or leaving any of the European Union’s ports: it was simply passing through our Community waters, and we have not yet got to grips with this, that is to say, we have not taken any decision to control ‘floating dustbins’ – such as the Prestige 
– which sail through our waters on a daily basis, and this is a challenge which we still have before us and which we must deal with if we want to prevent unfortunate accidents such as the Prestige
 in the future. (Applause)

Mr President, although they are issues which do not only affect cod, I would like to condemn the fact that several European fisheries regulations do not take account of the discrimination that Basque fishermen and fishermen from the Spanish state have been suffering since accession to the European Community. Today it is still intended to maintain this injustice by restricting their access to the so-called Irish Box, the intention being to redefine it as a sensitive area in the Irish Sea. I agree with looking after sensitive areas, but opportunities must be equal for all. Furthermore, for the calculation of the database which will serve as a reference for the future allocation of the permitted kilowatts per day of fishing capacity, account has not been taken of the temporary halts by our vessels in years past, voluntarily, in order to allow for the self recovery of fish species. Others did not stop, they used what they fished and now they are benefiting from it, taking account of those tonnes which they caught. It is now time for the Europe of freedom and of the common market to legislate equitably and for there not to be first-class and second-class fishermen.

Mr President—in-Office of the Council, it is said that the Union will be based on principles of modern democracy but, nevertheless, it is the governments of the States – in other words the European Council – who will decide on the content of the Constitutional Treaty. Furthermore, this will be carried out by finding fault with the Convention, which was the nearest thing to a constitutive assembly and which in every way better represented the citizens. According to democratic principles, sovereignty resides with the people and not with executive governments. The antidemocratic nature of this Union does not stop there, however. However much it is proposed to increase the legislative competences of the European Parliament, it will still be the governments of the States in the Councils who will give the go-ahead to European laws and regulations which will then be obligatory for everybody. I would therefore ask that there not be a legislative Council of Ministers but rather a second European territorial Chamber, whose members will be appointed by the parliaments of the States and by legislative constitutional bodies. That would really be a democratic Europe. Furthermore, it seems to me incoherent to propose changing the current reference to peoples in Article 1 of the Treaty for a reference to citizens when the constitutions of the States enshrine their respective peoples and when Articles 5 and 8 call for respect for the identity of the Member States.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to draw Parliament’s attention, as the budgetary authority, to two lines of financial aid which are different to those mentioned recently. The first is the line for projects of common interest for the trans-European transport networks. The Treaty of Maastricht gave the Community the task of contributing to the creation and development of trans-European infrastructure networks for transport, telecommunications and energy. These networks fall within the framework of the general objective of social and economic cohesion. In this regard, on 9 October the Commission presented to the Council of Ministers its new proposal containing a statement of projects of European interest. It is a very ambitious proposal, but it does not have the necessary resources. I am therefore proposing in an amendment that priority must be given to sea and river transport, rail and cross-border connection projects, but, above all, to those projects to which the Member States are already committing significant resources. For the latter, please refer to the Van Miert report, presented on 30 June 2003, because there are many other projects which have been on the table since the Essen European Council in 1994 and today, nine years later, they have yet to be dealt with. I therefore suggest that the Commission should demand the cancellation or even return of the aid allocated to an action in the event that that action has not been completed within 10 years of its approval. Nevertheless, the Commission would have the power not to apply that time limit in the case of an extraordinarily large project or an unexpected delay. Secondly, tourism will soon be the European Union's most important service industry. The World Tourism Organisation expects the number of tourist arrivals to double, to approximately 720 million a year in 2020, and the 9 million people for whom it provides work will increase by between 2 and 3.5 million, to 12.5 million jobs. We therefore proposed that resources be allocated at European level to assist the promotion, monitoring and assessment of an ecologically and socially sustainable tourism policy, which, however, was rejected. I trust that, in the future, the Constitutional Treaty will consider this activity as a Community objective, because it affects all of us, service providers and users.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that in the fast process of globalisation which humanity is experiencing – a process which also shrinks the horizon of our world by seeking a universal cosmic and interplanetary dimension – it is strategically important for our Union to have an advanced space policy. I therefore totally support the decisions which have been taken by the European Council in Lisbon in this respect, the comments and proposals of the Commission since 1999 and the parallel decisions of the intergovernmental European Space Agency. I also support the proposal in Article 50 which the Convention has produced in order to provide a legal basis for Community actions. As in other sectors, Europe must have the necessary ambition and impetus, reflected in its budgets, to be able to play a leading role on the international stage. It must have independent access to space and develop suitable technologies. And it must do so within a system of international cooperation, particularly with the United States and with Russia, who are pioneers in terms of space, and also with others such as Japan, China, etc. But that cooperation cannot be subordinate. Under no circumstances must it be subordinate. In this regard, I am happy with the progress made in one area of our space policy, the Galileo project, and the agreements which ensure its interoperability with the American GPS system, and I hope that we will soon reach agreements with the Russian Glonass system as well. I trust that those agreements do not subordinate the civilian use of our Galileo system to military priorities which cause occasional shadowing of the signal and which are not subject to the control of the people responsible for European security and certainly do not require the consent of these decision-makers. Mutual collaboration, yes, but subordination, no. I would like to end by congratulating Mr Bodrato on the fine report he has presented to us on European space policy.

Mr President, Commissioner, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy I would firstly like to express our admiration for the extraordinary work carried out by fishermen, their professional organisations and associations, and the thousands of volunteers, who have lessened the impact of the damage to the environment. At the same time, we would like to point out that, in addition to repairing the environmental damage and maintaining the aid for all those individuals and companies affected by the oil slick in the fisheries, seafood and aquaculture sectors, we must ensure fair compensation for all of the social and economic damage caused by the Prestige
 accident in the other industrial sectors affected, such as canning, commerce, transport, hotel and catering, tourism, etc. To this end, we call for the mobilisation of all Community funds and technical resources, without exception, for the adoption of the supplementary fund for compensation for oil pollution damage and for further budget resources for environmental impact assessments, compensation for losses not covered by a current international agreement, the creation of a network for the exchange of experience in the field of hydrocarbon pollution, emergency action plans, etc. For all these purposes, allocations of funds made to Objective 2 or other regions must have the same level of Community co-financing as Objective 1 regions, thus avoiding imbalances in treatment that would be unjustified in the case of damage caused by agencies outside the actual areas affected. We also request that the ban on the entry into EU ports for single-hull vessels carrying dangerous cargo be extended, by the creation of a specific EU law, to ships in transit through Community waters, as is the case in the United States. With what has been agreed up to now, we would not prevent a situation like the Prestige
 accident. On a personal note, I want to condemn the fact that the most effective operations to recover fuel in the high seas, carried out by the Basque Country’s fishing fleet, are to date the only operations in the entire Spanish State not to have received the aid provided for in the Community Regulation. I trust that this discrimination will not continue. Finally, we must not delay in establishing a temporary committee to examine in greater detail the causes and consequences of the Prestige
 accident and propose effective measures to prevent disasters like this in the future.

Mr President, I regret that, despite having offered a written translation, I have not been authorised to speak in Euskera – the language of an ancestral people, the Basques, which has survived the passing of time with a small population and which, in the opinion of eminent foreign researchers, is the language of the first residents of Europe. By speaking in my language, I would have liked to have stressed the reality of this European Union which we are building amongst all of us on the basis of respect for our own cultural diversity. I believe we are all concerned, not just the green ecologists, when the biodiversity of nature is threatened by man's actions. However, we often forget human biodiversity, one of the main manifestations of which are the different languages and cultures which are sometimes not respected or protected, but rather there is simply an attempt to eliminate them, for the sake of the commercial convenience of uniformity and globalising tendencies. Since I believe that the individual, the person, is above commercial and economic interests, I would advocate constant support for national, regional and minority languages, independently of changes in political power, as well as decisive support for multilingualism so that we can build our Union without it becoming a confused tower of Babel. I would finally like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ebner, on his wonderful report.

Mr President, thank you very much for your words. I tried, through my group, to offer a translation of my words and to speak in Euskera, and the reply was that only one person per Parliamentary group could speak. Mr Wyn is from my group. He has been allowed to speak and I have not. That is what I understand from the reply I have been given.

Mr President, in the Spanish state, fundamental rights are being violated by terrorist killings, extortion, threats and violence. Faced with these, the response, under the rule of law, must not be an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, but the application of democratic law and scrupulous respect for the human rights of all citizens, including the perpetrators of violence. Nevertheless, the actions of the Spanish Government do not respect the rights of prisoners and their families. Prisoners are moved further away from their homes and not allowed to study in their mother tongues, thereby preventing them from registering in universities in their communities. All of this goes against the constitutional objective of rehabilitation and social reintegration of prisoners with a view to achieving a fairer and more civilised society. It is also unacceptable, in a state which purports to respect the rule of law, that the government has ordered the closure of two news organisations. These closures were furthermore of a pre-emptive nature and no sentence has been passed for any crime. This is all the more serious in view of the fact that one of these daily newspapers – Egunkaria
 – is the only source of news written in a minority national language – Euskera – which we are obliged to respect and not to discriminate against under the terms of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

Mr President, I must categorically reject the words directed at me by Mr Hernández Mollar. I could reply in the same tone. I am not going to do so. I believe that the first thing I said in my speech was that in the Spanish state fundamental rights are being suspended as the result of the actions of violent people. I will never put the rights of violent people before the rights of others. If we really want to resolve the political conflict being endured by the Basques, however, we must begin by respecting all the human rights of all the citizens, without exception.

Mr President, I would like to thank the President—in-Office of the Council for this reply, but must remind him that, just today, a news item appeared in the Spanish press stating that the Red Cross, which is dealing with the immigrants arriving on the Andalusian coasts, specifically in Tarifa, just yesterday had to ask local Andalusian citizens for clothing to give to the immigrants who were there, who had arrived on the coast and who were living in deplorably inhumane conditions. In this regard, what I would like to ask is whether you believe that, independently of all these issues approved at European Councils, we should not take humanitarian measures appropriate to the everyday reality taking place on our coasts, and other places which are not coastal, where there are immigrants living in bad conditions who require suitable humanitarian assistance?

Mr President, Minister, on the subject of suicide attacks, I am reminded of a recent book by the French sociologist and thinker Emmanuel Todd which is entitled After the Empire
. In it he discusses how societies, as their education improves, develop towards democracy to become a political system which guarantees freedoms and justice, and, in this process, the West appears to be the great promoter of democracy, progress and development of peoples, while at the same time being leader and arbitrator of conflicts. In seeking and prioritising its own interests, however, the West does not behave with justice and equity in its international relations, but rather it generates a new form of anti-democratic autarchy which will end up bringing it into conflict with the rest of the world and will lead to its unsustainable decline. In the light of these views of Mr Todd, I would like to ask you whether you do not believe that through unjust impositions and exploitations, through pre-emptive wars based on false evidence of weapons of mass destruction and risks to world security – as in the case of Iraq – what the invading governments have created, rather than peace and freedom, has been new despair and new hates whose only outlet seems to be terrorist attacks and self-destruction aimed at achieving a fairer world for those suffering from exploitation and aggression.

Believe me, Minister, I also vigorously condemn terrorist activities and the crimes committed, but I would like to point out that the American professor, John Esposito, an expert in Islam who heads the centre for understanding between Muslims and Christians, has stated that Washington has always based its relations with the Gulf countries on oil interests, and not on an understanding of their culture and their people. He has stated that we must distinguish between extremists and the majority of citizens and that, in order to combat terrorism, without alienating Muslims and causing a genuine clash of civilisations, we need public diplomacy and we need to build bridges and tackle the roots of the problems, and that simply to use military and economic means is not sufficient. So I would like to ask a question. Does the Council believe that the decision to invade Iraq, adopted with the participation of European leaders such as Mr Aznar, Mr Blair, and also Mr Berlusconi, which has led to a great numbers of deaths, to destruction, immigration and desolation, is a better way to deal with the problem of world security than initiatives such as the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland or the Roadmap for the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Do you not believe that, as Professor Esposito points out, if we want democracy in the Middle East or in any part of the world, we cannot go about it by telling people in other countries what that democracy must consist of, how it must be organised and who must lead it?

Minister, you have not answered my question in relation to the involvement of Mr Aznar, Mr Blair and Mr Berlusconi in the war in Iraq. You mentioned the Barcelona Council and the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue – that is all very well – and you have also said, in your reply to Mrs McKenna, that the Council had not dealt with the issue of the Iraq war. I would like to ask you whether it is not true that the Greek Presidency was trying to bring the European Council together to deal with this issue of the war and Mr Blair, Mr Aznar and Mr Berlusconi were opposed to the issue being dealt with within the European Council?

Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing today with the Marco Polo programme, aimed at reducing traffic congestion and contributing to a more effective and sustainable transport system. We are going to vote in favour of the text proposed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, but we cannot say that we are completely satisfied with it. Firstly, because the economic contribution we requested has been reduced by the Council of Ministers from EUR 115 million to EUR 75 million, a reduction which we believe is going to prevent us from achieving the objective of transferring the expected total annual increase in international goods transport by road to other alternative modes of transport, and this increase is expected to be in the order of 50% up until 2010. To this end, and according to the data in the White Paper on transport, the railways and ships should absorb an extra 39% in terms of tonnes of goods per kilometre than it currently does, which when added to its own trend of increase, which is now 29%, would mean a 68% total increase in its capacity for traffic, which I do not believe can be financed with the reduced budget. If, as the Commission points out, with one euro of subsidy 500 tonnes could be transferred, with the EUR 75 million allowed by the Council, 37 500 tonnes per kilometre could be transferred, rather than the 52 250 million tonnes per year by which road transport is expected to increase. In other words, the objectives of the Marco Polo programme could not be achieved. Neither are we pleased about the fact that the possibility of funding actions for the reduction and prevention of goods transport by road, without necessarily implying transfer to other modes, has not been included. We believe it is possible to act during the stages prior to the loading of lorries, for example, by promoting a more compact form of packaging of goods so that they take up less space and require fewer lorries. And finally, although this may be the subject of a different proposal, we believe that it is also necessary to consider reflecting on the current model of production and distribution of goods. If we truly incorporate, without a single exception, all the external costs of transport, perhaps we will reach the conclusion that we should reconsider our theory of economy of scale in production and of the benefits of its concentration.

Mr President, I would like to refer to Articles 6 and 7 of the European Union Treaty, which indicate, respectively, that that Union is based on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the Rule of Law. And that, on the proposal of Parliament or the Commission, the Council can note the existence of a clear risk of serious violation of these principles on the part of a Member State. All of this means, from a legal point of view, that the possible violation of freedoms and rights on the part of a State is the competence of the European institutions. So I would like to vigorously condemn and protest against the anti democratic and illegal abuse I have received from Mr Pat Cox, President of Parliament, who has refused to include in this part-session two questions which I have presented in relation to two possible violations of the Rules of Law, of human rights and fundamental freedoms by Mr Aznar and his Spanish Government. Firstly, because of an apparent lack of respect for the separation of powers, in view of his public statements telling the Spanish Supreme Court that it should agree to the annulment of 240 electoral candidatures which had been legally admitted by the ordinary electoral courts, and secondly for creating a law prohibiting Basque prisoners from studying and taking examinations at the Public University of the Basque Country, the only university that offers education in the Basque language, which may be a violation of the right to linguistic diversity.

Mr President, I agree with what you say about the Rules of Procedure. I believe I have obeyed them to the letter. The President tells me that this issue does not fall within the competence of the Council, but Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty indicate that it falls within the competence of the Council and of Parliament. That is why I put the question. Secondly, I would like it to be noted that my questions did not contain statements of any type. They are simply questions and the text is there to be read.

 Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Spanish citizens have not forgotten how Mr Fraga Iribarne, founder and honorary President of the People’s Party, and mentor of the current President, Mr Aznar, as a minister under the dictator Franco, deceived them by swimming in the sea at Mojácar and say that he also did so at Palomares, where four thermonuclear bombs had fallen as a result of a collision during an aerial refuelling operation between a B-52 bomber and a tanker plane. In the meantime, the US cleared and fenced off 105 hectares of land contaminated with radioactivity in a large area which was closed to the Spanish people and referred to as Camp Wilson. Today, the Spanish People’s Party Government has also begun to deny that several B-52 bombers were refuelled in the skies above Bilbao, Iruña/Pamplona and Barcelona on 21 March last, on their way to Iraq. Confronted with evidence provided by air traffic controllers, the Spanish Government had no choice yesterday but to recognise in Parliament that that day, at the very least, it authorised the overflying and refuelling of eight bombers carrying 240 tonnes of bombs, and justified this by saying that this involved low-risk manoeuvres. Does the Council believe it acceptable for these operations to be carried out overflying densely populated towns and cities and for the Government to claim there is no risk? Does the Council consider it democratic for a government cynically to have denied these events and deceived its citizens so blatantly?

 With all due respect for the opinion of Mr Oreja Arburúa, I bring here any issues that affect European citizens. The Basque and Catalan citizens who were at risk from the overflying B-52 bombers, and also the Andalusian citizens who were at risk from four bombs which fell on them, are European citizens and, therefore, responding that this is an internal affair is simply an attempt to avoid taking the bull by the horns, when it is a matter that affects European citizens.

Mr President, Commissioner, we are establishing the minimum insurance requirements to be fulfilled by air companies and operators flying through our airspace or providing services destined for or departing from the European Union, in order to guarantee their liability for possible damage which may be caused to passengers, luggage, cargo, mail or third parties. In order to successfully achieve such a laudable objective, we must not allow the Regulation we are approving to contain imprecise definitions or confused concepts, since that could lead to situations in which there is no cover or protection, either for the consumer using the air service or for third parties suffering damage in the event of incidents. We therefore propose several amendments, with a view to better defining in the regulatory text the terms 'passenger', 'insurance' and 'flight', compensation to third parties, where appropriate, and we also advocate the inclusion amongst the risks insured of other contingencies, accidents and fortuitous incidents, as well as the risks caused by acts of war, terrorism, kidnap, sabotage, hijack and social or industrial disturbances. Furthermore, we propose that companies and operators registered in a third country, that is, outside the European Union, can be considered as conforming to the requirements of this regulation we are discussing, provided that they produce an insurance certificate, issued under appropriate regulatory conditions by any insurer authorised to operate legally in accordance with Community law. We also propose that, in all cases of aircraft operated under a leasing system, with or without crews, for whatever time period, it should always be the companies or operators carrying out flights who should fulfil the minimum insurance requirements. Finally, we ask the Commission to take the initiative to harmonise legislation on insurance against risks in all the Union’s air terminals, so that we do not end up in a situation where only possible damage suffered during flights is covered, but also any damage during the rest of the time that users remain within the air transport service chain.

 Madam President, Commissioner, once we became aware that, even if it were the main commercial power, Europe could not play any important role in the international order unless it had a common foreign and security policy, the so-called third pillar was adopted in the Treaty of Maastricht and the objective was set of creating an operative military capacity in order to guarantee the maintenance of peace. In an increasingly global and interdependent world, until now our policy has been to establish international law, above all through the United Nations, but also through other world organisations, and we have therefore drawn up a regulatory framework for international relations, because we are convinced that that is the best way to prevent and deal with any possible conflicts. And we believe that, within this world order, the European Union should act with a common voice which will allow it to be seen as a commercial, economic and social power and also as a great defender of human rights, multiculturalism and the environment. However, the reality of our current situation is disappointing. Once again, internal division has won out over the great Community declarations made at summits of Heads of State and Government. I am referring to the differing positions maintained by the governments of the 15 countries within the United Nations Security Council with regard to the conflict in Iraq. The actions of Mr Aznar, Head of the Spanish Government, as well as those of certain others, would be reprehensible enough if only because they have caused this division, because, without waiting for the Council of the European Union to adopt a common position on the issue, they were quick to blindly follow the orders from the emperor who is attempting to establish a new unilateral world order. The bad thing is that Mr Aznar and his colleagues have promoted an illegal war, a humanitarian disaster with thousands of children, women and civilians killed, mutilated and injured, or suffering terror, hunger and disease. The worst is that Mr Aznar has done so by bypassing the Constitution, without the approval of Parliament nor the sanction of the King of Spain and, together with his minions, going against world opinion and the opinion of the weapons inspectors, and without the support of the United Nations Security Council, has dealt a fatal blow to international law and institutions and has put the world at the mercy of the strongest, giving way to force and failing to make use of reason and justice. To sum up, it is due to them that the world has returned to the law of the jungle and that the third pillar of the European Union has been broken up.

Commissioner, since the Erika 
accident on 19 December 1999, several initiatives have been taken by the European Parliament and the other European institutions to increase maritime safety. Unfortunately, the appropriate measures must not have been taken, because subsequently, in November 2002, we suffered a new maritime accident – involving the Prestige 
– and now we are revising what was approved at the first opportunity, resulting from the Erika
 disaster. To this end, we are currently also working in the European Parliament’s Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the reform of the Regulation on single-hull and double-hull oil tankers and there is a very important issue, which relates to the contribution. You have said that there is a European Union response centre, and I would like to know whether in it you have established emergency plans, above all for sensitive coastal areas, such as those of Galicia and Brittany, where year after year there are successive oil tanker accidents which cause damage to the environment.

Mr President, following the terrible accident involving the Prestige
 and its repercussions for people and for the environment, we wish to suggest that a Community coastguard service be created, which would be responsible for preventing vessels that are not in a fit condition to sail from doing so. With regard to this point, I wish to ask the Council a question: is this matter that we are now addressing not precisely one more reason for creating this European coastguard service, not aimed specifically at suppressing what you defined as the ‘fight against illegal immigration’, but which would also save the lives of many individuals who, on rafts or by other means, attempt to reach Europe's coasts and who often fail?

Mr President, Commissioners, I am particularly glad that you are here. The Charter of Fundamental Rights, approved by this Parliament, prohibits any discrimination on the grounds of language or of belonging to a national minority and enshrines the principle of freedom of expression and information without the interference of public authorities. Well, Mr President, Commissioner, the Basque people have suffered further abuse and discrimination from the Spanish institutions. For preventive reasons – the same argument used by Mr Aznar to justify the war against Iraq – the newspaper Egunkaria
 has been closed down – and I have a copy in my hand – the only daily entirely published in Basque, the language not just of the Basques, but – according to the most prestigious experts – the primitive language of the Europeans. And, in order to try to justify the unjustifiable, the Interior Minister of Mr Aznar’s government has issued a joint communication with the judge of the National High Court. This unusual fact calls into question the existence in Spain of the democratic principle of separation of public powers. This newspaper has been closed for preventive reasons, putting all of its workers out of work, without even complying with the provisions of Article 129 of the Spanish Penal Code, on which their decision is based, since they have not allowed the required prior hearing of the company’s legal representatives. This means there has been no defence, and furthermore means that this judgment is illegal. Not a single piece of incriminating evidence has been produced on the content of the newspaper, since it is a pluralist, objective and democratic publication. They have closed it simply because it defends the right of Basques to their own identity and to use their own language. Furthermore, the director of the newspaper was imprisoned and later freed. But he has accused the Civil Guard of torture, which takes us even further back, if that is possible, to the times … (The President cut off the speaker)

Mr President, Commissioner, free access to the port services market and equality of opportunities are requirements of the Union’s Treaties and, in this regard, it is urgent that reliable information be available in order to regulate and monitor that no State provides aid to their ports, since this jeopardises free competition between the different Community ports. There are, however, aspects which should not be exclusively regulated by the Union. The Member States and their constitutional bodies with competences in this area must maintain their capacity to include their specific rules on invitations to tender for service-providing contracts and for the protection of the workers involved. Furthermore, pilotage, mooring services and stowage, given their status as obligatory services, must not be included in the Community Directive, but their regulation must remain in the hands of the respective port authorities, without prejudice to respect for European social conditions. And, just as an airport would be in chaos if it had various air traffic control companies, in a port there must only be one pilotage service and one mooring service and self-handling must not be allowed, and would only be acceptable if it were carried out by regular seafaring crew who furthermore are duly qualified and have sufficient knowledge to ensure that safety is not jeopardised.

I was rapporteur for one of the reports on the Erika I
 package. The Erika
 accident took place on 19 December 1999. I believe that the Commission did its work perfectly, because in March 2000 it presented us with this first package of measures. Parliament worked on it and, with more delay than we would have liked, we finally achieved a proposal in December 2000 – a year after the Erika 
accident – on which we had reached consensus with the then representative of the Council, the French Transport Minister. The day after that Council, in Parliament, as a result of the actions of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the whole agreement we had reached became deadlocked, and the first Erika
 package was not approved until a year later (December 2001). And the worst thing of all is that it was not just the Group of the European People’s Party that held up this Erika I
 package, but also the Council, which delayed its common position with regard to double hulls until August 2001. While we are facing another disaster, which took place in November 2002 – three years after the Erika
 accident – the Council and the Member States have still not brought the measures in the Erika I
 and Erika II
 packages into force. Hence my question: why are the appropriate decisions not taken so that we do not have to suffer another such disaster, and so that the adoption of measures is speeded up with the efficiency that this case demands?

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we have spoken here of the fact that the Council has decided to speed up the entry into force of ports of refuge – I believe that this is a correct and necessary measure – and that it has not taken a decision in relation to the European coastguard service. I would like this service to be set up as soon as possible, as well as a compensation fund for pollution accidents similar to the one they have in the United States. I would like to ask him specifically whether he believes that, for this type of disaster, we also need an emergency pilot plan at European level. Do you not believe that we should have a European rapid reaction force for this type of incident, including volunteers? Do you not also believe that we should identify particularly sensitive corridors, so that we can have an emergency plan in each case?

Mr President, Commissioner, we are today dealing at first reading with both the development strategy and the interoperability of the trans-European rail system, including its safety, and the creation of a European agency responsible for its monitoring and which I believe should also be responsible for its control. In my opinion, and since I am in favour of the liberalisation of rail transport, I am not sure that it is right to liberalise the infrastructures, that is, the railway lines. I believe it would be better, as is the case with motorways, to only liberalise the operation of the railways, leaving the rail infrastructures under public ownership. I believe this would be the best formula for sustainable responsibility for the appropriate maintenance of them beyond the restrictions which would be imposed by the objectives of economic and financial viability inherent in any private initiative. And, in any event, I believe there must be an early assessment of the effects of liberalisation both in terms of safety, social and environmental repercussions, the effect on the interests of clients and users and on public service as well as the development of intermodality, and also its effect on the companies involved within the transport market. I would ask the Commission to inform us regularly and periodically on all these issues.

Mr President, Commissioner, I am saying nothing new when I insist that diversity is one of the characteristic principles of the united Europe we are building. This is a real difficulty, yes, but it must inspire us and it must not prevent us from seeing the wood for the trees and from finding a valid architecture so that all the institutional elements, all the existing democratic public powers, can find their places in the common Europe. In our Union there are still many deficiencies which we must clear up. We are trying to deal with one of them in this report we are debating today: the position of the regions and local powers, but, above all, the territories with legislative powers, in the future Community architecture. The Union Treaty and all the legislation based on it must make it obligatory to take account of the territorial and institutional diversity existing within the Member States, including electoral laws, so that the regions with legislative powers can become electoral constituencies for the European Parliament. These constitutional entities must be empowered to bring cases before the Court of Justice if Community decisions encroach upon or undermine their competences. It must be obligatory for the governments of the constitutional entities to participate in the meetings of the Council when issues are being dealt with which affect their exclusive competences, as in the case of taxation in the Basque Country. And it cannot be said that there are too many regions, since there are not so many entities with exclusive legislative powers. Even if all the regions were constitutional, however, the need to design a European institutional architecture which has room for all of them, in which they all have their place under the European sun, would be all the greater.

On 28 October, the Council of State of the French Republic approved a resolution declaring illegal the integration into the French public network of Diwan schools, which teach the Breton language, another autochthonous European language, like Basque, Catalan and also Alsatian, which originates from this very city of Strasbourg. Does the Presidency-in-Office of the Council not believe that, in order to comply with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was so pompously proclaimed in Nice by President Chirac and the former President of the European Parliament, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, the French Government should legally guarantee public access to the learning of these other native European languages within their respective territory? This is an issue, Mr President, which is included in the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, which states that linguistic diversity and all cultures will be defended. And this is not only an inter-State objective, but also a European Community objective.

Commissioner, my friend and colleague Carlos Bautista Ojeda has made a brief reference to this, but I would like to expand on one of the issues which he has raised: as you know, in the Spanish State users of two-wheeled vehicles have real difficulties finding companies who want to insure mopeds, motorcycles etc. Their only answer – in some cases – is to turn to the insurance compensation consortium. I do not know whether anything can be done in this regard, on the initiative of the Commission, because this is a great demand from the motorcycling sector: that there may really be insurance cover which is accessible and proportionate to the use, enjoyment and cost of motorcycles and two-wheeled vehicles in general.

Mr President, Commissioner, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is opposed to any move which involves relaxing safety standards and rules for passenger ships. We are also opposed to making the specific stability requirements for ro-ro ships less stringent. Instead, we would argue in favour of maintaining the standards in question as adopted under international agreements and conventions. Furthermore, we would like to draw particular attention to our support for the Commission’s proposal for an improved definition of the concept of persons with reduced mobility. We must fight against social discrimination wherever and however it manifests itself. In this connection, it is worth drawing attention to the obstacles many groups of people encounter, and the discrimination they suffer as a result. I have in mind people with sensory or intellectual impairments, wheelchair users, people with limb impairments, elderly people, pregnant women, small children, those accompanying them, and people transporting heavy luggage. It is worth remembering that the success of the policy on so-called seamlessness, aimed at promoting the use of public transport, depends on transfer from one form of transport to another not turning into an obstacle race. Furthermore, if the needs of persons with reduced mobility are taken into account when designing vessels, the vessels themselves will be safer and more user-friendly for all passengers.

 Mr President, this is a point of order. I would like to express my deep concern at what I consider to be discriminatory treatment against certain MEPs yesterday during Questions to the Commission. I saw on television, to my amazement, Mrs de Palacio, Vice-President of the Commission and Commissioner for Transport and Energy, responding personally in front of the door to this Assembly and in front of the media to Question No 93 from an MEP, which was answered orally because the time limit available for Questions to the Commission had been reached. Not only have I myself, together with other Members who had tabled questions preceding Question No 93, not received a personal explanation from any of the Commissioners, but we have also not even received the mandatory response in writing. In my view, this is discrimination and, since there is no such thing as first-rate and second-rate European citizens and all the Members represent the European citizens, this matter should be addressed and discrimination such as the example I have pointed out must not take place again.

 Mr President, I would like to say that the words of the speaker who preceded me are inadmissible. They are inadmissible, with reference to a complaint tabled correctly by me with regard to discriminatory treatment, without making any reference to the content of any question, for the discriminatory treatment received by the Members to be mixed up with a situation in the Basque country that, I am sad to say, is due precisely to the narrow-mindedness and lack of democracy we suffer in the Spanish State.

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, I do not think that Morocco will agree with what you have said about Perejil Island not belonging to anyone. I would like to ask you this: does the Council consider that it is fair and democratic for the Spanish government to claim that the citizens of Ceuta and Melilla do not want to be Moroccan because they are Spanish, while, on the other hand, at the same time refusing to allow the citizens of Gibraltar to decide freely in a referendum whether they want to be British or Spanish?

 Mr President, some people are determined to use and manipulate victims of terrorism, and these are not my words. The head of the main opposition party in the Spanish State said this recently. I must tell the Member who has just spoken – mixing a question on Gibraltar, Morocco and Spain with terrorism, with the victims, etc. – that if anyone is truly working in the Basque country to overcome the situation of political conflict we have been experiencing for over three centuries – a political conflict with the Spanish State and with the centralist government in Madrid – and is trying precisely to ensure that there are no more attacks, murders or violence in the Basque country, it is the Basque nationalists. We, the democratic Basque nationalists, have provided enough proof of our good will, our rejection of violence, our fight against terrorism and our defence of freedoms.

Mr President, Commissioner, we are all aware of the existing congestion on European roads and the significant external costs of goods transport by road, such as accidents, noise, pollution, climatic effects, the provision and maintenance of infrastructures etc. But this is nothing compared to the bleak predictions of what the future may hold if we do not implement measures to deal with these threats. It is calculated that goods transport by road in the Union will increase by 50% by 2010 at a rate – as the Commissioner has said quite rightly – of 12 000 million tonnes per kilometre per year, and it is clear that neither the Trans-European Networks nor our environment can endure the brutal impact of this increase. We therefore need to adopt measures which, far from affecting our economic growth and progress, guarantee its sustainability. The Marco Polo programme is an absolutely essential instrument, but we must ensure that it moves in the right direction. Given the limits on the resources available for this financial instrument, its aid must be focussed strictly towards the transfer of the greatest possible amount of the goods currently transported by road to other forms of transport which are more respectful of the environment and which produce fewer external costs, such as short sea shipping, railways and inland waterways. We have no choice but to sacrifice the intermodality between these latter two alternatives if we do not achieve our priority: to reduce the congestion of the roads. At the same time, as well as a common political will on cross-border projects, we must promote the prevention and reduction of transport needs. We must revise the systems of packaging, industrial logistics, the organisation of production chains, etc., with a view to preventing raw materials, intermediate goods and end products from having to be moved further than is essential. To this end, in business economies we must take account not only of the expenditure generated by transport services but also their external costs properly assessed. Only in that way can we achieve a general awareness which leads to an organisational transformation and a reduction in transport needs.

 Mr President-in-Office of the Council, many thanks for your response. I might be asking the impossible, but I would have liked the period for responding to our questions to be shorter, so that the Spanish Presidency could have replied to my question, as it, in its time, was responsible for the Seville European Council. Having said this, it is undeniable that in Europe, in the European Union, it is the Council that wields the most legislative power and, furthermore, controls executive power through the comitology procedure. I would like to ask you if you believe that the United States would be the world leader if its legislative power, instead of residing with the House of Representatives and the Senate, resided with a Ministerial Council composed of representatives of the various North American States, from New York State or Washington State to California, Florida or Colorado. If the American President, Mr Bush, had the level of attributions, competences and powers that our President, Mr Prodi, has, do you think he would have the influence and capacity he has in international relations and at domestic level? Would he have the same influence and capacity? I believe we must make Europe a true democracy, with separation of powers, as suggested by other speakers: legislative power should reside with this Parliament, and executive power with the Commission.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to highlight the slow pace at which the programming for regional policy for 2000-2006 has been implemented in terms of the use of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund and ISPA. In this sense, the new penalties are not an exception and, nevertheless, despite our delay in approving their guidelines, a large number of programmes have been put before the European Commission, which shows that Parliament was right to defend these actions, which promote a direct relationship between Brussels and the regions. I also think that we should provide more advice for the candidate countries on how to put together their proposals and increase the percentage of Community funding. With regard to the line of funding of the European transport networks in this financial year, the level of completion is still very low, which leads us to believe that there may be more interest in some trans-European projects in the Member States surrounding them than in the actual Member State where they are taking place, which will have to be responsible for the majority of the funding. In general terms, I do not think that it is the municipalities and regions that are responsible for the poor budgetary implementation, given that, first of all, it is we in the European Institutions who have taken a long time to approve and define the guidelines and programmes. We have also allowed very short deadlines for using the financial resources: two years from when they are budgeted. This deadline is very hard for the regional institutions to comply with when they receive Community approval for their projects very late and have to respect standards of democratic transparency for invitations to tender in order to put together the projects, have them approved, find partners, conduct subsequent public invitations to tender for the contract to carry out the work, etc. All this means that it takes more than two years for the work to begin, as the Commissioner said. We should not try to erase Community policy aimed at the regions of the Union, but rather we should increase it in order to correct the regional imbalances and, above all, we should listen to these infra-State bodies more, not pass on our own slowness in planning and making decisions to them, and put ourselves in their position, with the problems they have in successfully completing their projects, and help them.

Mr President, Mr Aznar, you proposed the objective "more Europe” for your Presidency. Today we have the result of less Europe in terms of solidarity, with immigration being confused with crime and many Spaniards forgetting that, not so many years ago, they were forced to be immigrants in order to find the means to live. Less Europe in terms of reunification, with the failure to comply with the deadlines set in Nice for enlargement; less Europe in terms of democracy, with the European Council gaining in power, the power of the executives standing above Parliament; less Europe in terms of economic stability, with the previously agreed plan being made more flexible; less Europe in terms of foreign policy, with a Bush plan for the Middle East that ignores Europe’s position; less Europe in terms of participation, due to the Autonomous Regions being prevented from taking part in your Presidency, which was in contrast with the regular presence of the Belgian regions. And the only area in which you have promoted more Europe is in penalties and punishments for the poor countries that are the origin of immigration. The same thing that has been done in Spain with unemployment benefits or in the case of the conflict in the Basque Country, imposition and repression. At least the other European leaders improved on what you did in time and your overall proposal for penalties, as well as your Presidency, ultimately failed.

Mr President, Commissioner, we believe in the concept of the single market and in the Community principle of the free movement of people, capital, services and goods, but we also argue in favour of quality of life and the environment. The former and the latter often come into conflict, a conflict of interests, and we therefore understand the need to apply certain restrictions to movement in order to safeguard co-existence. In this regard, several Member States have established differing timetables and dates for restrictions, which is creating great confusion for hauliers, for the senders and receivers of cargo, as well as disturbance in the freight market in terms of distribution and supply. All of this means that we need to seek a minimum degree of harmonisation at Community level in relation to timetables for restrictions and to this end it will firstly be essential to provide an effective information system for hauliers. We also need reliable statistics on congestion on the Trans-European Networks, on its peak days and hours etc., and also on the ecological impact of high traffic densities, in order to better protect our environment. Furthermore, we must take advantage of these restrictions on heavy goods traffic to ensure that drivers enjoy a minimum period of uninterrupted rest. Furthermore, it would not be democratic for some Member States to be able to maintain their previously established restrictions indefinitely, while the new States are not allowed to introduce them. It is only fair that this privilege should last for a limited time period. I would finally like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Savary, on the quality of his report and on having managed, after two previous failed attempts, to bring about a parliamentary debate during this plenary on regulations harmonising traffic restrictions, which are so essential to the effective operation and co-existence between the market and the people and to the environment in Europe.

Madam President, Commissioner, given that they are essential for our progress, we need to increase funding for priority projects to develop our trans-European networks and also to prioritise rail, air and sea transport and their interoperability, as more sustainable alternatives to roads that have a lesser impact on the environment. Out of the fourteen projects that were agreed as priorities at the Essen European Council in 1996, so far only three have been completed. Among the projects that I really wish to see is the Southern high-speed rail network between Madrid, Vitoria and Dax, which is still in the project design phase. Given the limitations of Community resources, I think that it is advisable to postpone incorporating any new priority projects until the first ones have been completed, and to wait until the guidelines are reviewed when enlargement to new Member States takes place. I also propose, as I state in my amendments, that the high-speed rail network can be achieved not only through building new lines but also by improving the condition of existing lines, in order to prevent further impacts on the countryside and the surrounding environment.

 Mr President, I would like to quote a few words by Arturo Campión to the President-in-Office of the Council. Arturo Campión, a great Navarran thinker, used to say that there are French Basques who are not Spanish, but who are Basque, and Spanish Basques who are not French, but who are Basque: both are Basques and Europeans.

 First of all, I should like to say to the President-in-Office of the Council that King Ferdinand of Aragón was not a Spanish king, because Spain did not exist at that time; he was a king of Aragón. Secondly, I want to point out to him that Ireland’s refusal to ratify the Treaty of Nice and Denmark’s reluctance in the past are proof that the small Member States are afraid that the large States – the superstates – may impose their own criteria and interests on them. I should therefore like to ask him if the best solution for the smaller States’ fears might not be to grant the European Parliament full legislative competence in all Community and European Union matters, without exception, and to demand the presence of the governments of the historical nations, federal states and constitutional regions in the Councils of Ministers, providing a more balanced position for the Council’s decisions, which would not be so centralising but rather more balanced and better distributed from a territorial point of view.

 I must first join in condemning terrorism and the attack on Mr Biagi. Secondly, I would like to express my condolences to his family and friends. The European Council had adopted the so-called Barcelona Declaration on the Middle East in the hope of pressing for a solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians through dialogue. Congratulations are certainly due on that account. Unfortunately I do not believe that the same applies to Mr Aznar and the Spanish Government when their conduct with regard to the historical and political conflict with the Basque people resembles that of the proverbial dog in the manger, which neither eats nor allows others to do so. On the one hand, Mr Aznar refuses to engage in democratic dialogue on this issue. On the other, he disregards and undermines efforts made by pacifist organisations such as El Karri. He has even gone so far as to bring the whole weight of Spanish diplomacy to bear on the United States’ Senate and Congress, in an effort to prevent them from debating the Basque situation. Fortunately, Members of the Senate and of Congress stood firm. They voted through various resolutions condemning terrorism, calling for respect for the Basque people’s right to self-determination, and the promotion of democratic dialogue as a means of achieving a peaceful solution to the situation in the Basque Country. The latter is located within the Union, between France and Spain. It is therefore an internal European Union problem. We must strive to resolve it whilst also combating terrorism. I regret that Mr Aznar has left the House. Perhaps he does not wish to hear what the nationalists have to say. Finally, I trust that my comments will not lead Mr Salafranca to accuse me of speaking on behalf of some terrorist group.

Mr Secretary of State, I believe that this is an issue of cultural characteristics and open democratic characteristics. In Europe, there are more than one hundred peoples and more than one hundred different languages. 2001 was declared International Year of Languages in the European Union. And I say this is an issue of characteristics because, in the Spanish State, we tried to ensure that during 2001 there would be cultural events aimed at protecting and promoting the native languages existing within the Spanish State, which are not limited to Castilian, since there is bable
 (Asturian), Catalan, Galician, Basque... and many other languages which have a natural right to continue to exist. The Government of the Spanish State did not allow any of these languages to be promoted or cared for. I would like to ask you what the reason is for this closed and anti-democratic attitude to something which goes hand in hand with the wealth of cultural diversity in both Europe and the Spanish State?

I have Question No 13 which is practically identical to No 6, and I would have liked you, as on other occasions, to have combined questions so that we do not have to debate the same issue twice. I do not know if there is still time for you to allow me to put Question No 13.

 – (ES) 
I would firstly like to thank you for your answer to the previous question on this same subject. As you will have realised, the reply just given by the President-in-Office of the Council is the same as the one he gave to Question No 6. I would like to point out that Article 203 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities speaks of ‘ministerial rank’ and, both in the meetings of the Councils of Ministers and during the Presidency, there is quite naturally participation by representatives of the Belgian regions or autonomous communities, or whatever you want to call them, and also – as the MEP who spoke about this said earlier – the region or nation of Scotland, the German Länder
 or the Austrian States and other such examples within the Community. In this regard, I would like to ask whether you consider the Spanish Government’s action in this respect to be appropriate. When talking about, for example, economic and financial affairs, or a plan for budgetary stability, it reaches agreements with the other governments of the Union, but when the same is to be raised on the level of the Spanish State, you impose it by law, instead of seeking agreement and consensus with the Communities which have exclusive competence in these areas.

Mr Vidal-Quadras said that the party I represent, and I myself, want to subvert the Spanish Constitution. The positions we advocate have nothing to do with subversion. According to the Spanish Constitution, the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country, to which I belong, has certain exclusive competences in certain areas. On tax issues, for example. Decisions are habitually made in the Council of Ministers of the European Union on fiscal issues while the interested parties are not represented there to defend themselves, as is the case with our Autonomous Community of the Basque Country and the Autonomous Community of Navarre. We do not feel represented by the Madrid government because we have frequent differences on the issue of sovereignty; a sovereignty which has not been granted us as a result of the generosity of the Madrid government, but which originates from the historic rights of the Basque people.

Mr President, Commissioner, we are debating the own-initiative report on the management of regional policy and the Structural Funds presented by Mr Pohjamo, whom I would like to thank for his good work. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled five amendments because we want to highlight some of the aspects relating to the issue we are dealing with. Firstly, while we agree that cooperation with other agents – other than State and regional governments, that is to say, with local communities, NGOs, private bodies, etc. – is beneficial in terms of achieving the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the Union, we do not believe that that cooperation has been satisfactorily respected in all the Member States, but that it has been applied in an unequal fashion. We therefore affectionately urge the Commission to try to ensure that socio-economic and environmental cooperation be applied equally in all regions receiving Community Funds and to ensure that the programming of projects is subject to consultation with the parliaments and governments of the constitutional regions which have legislative powers. We also demand the creation of clear indicators intended to assess the application of this cooperation principle. Furthermore, within the framework of the guidelines for the intermediate evaluation of September 2002, we want the Commission to define indicators for the efficient allocation of the reserve which, as well as financial management, take account of other aspects of management, such as cooperation, additionality and the quality of expenditure. At the same time, we ask that, in the event that unspent resources are reallocated, the appropriations which are not used be directed towards the least-favoured regions which are most active and innovative, as well as measures in favour of sustainable development. Finally, in support of the rapporteur’s idea – with regard to including the quality aspect in the annual monitoring of programmes subsidised by the Commission – we propose an assessment of their contribution to the implementation of the Union’s strategies relating to sustainable development and employment. We hope that our amendments will receive the majority support of Parliament, since they will serve to improve our Community economic and social objectives.

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have just referred to ‘more Europe’ and the fight against terrorism as two of your great objectives, and I share them and wish you every success. Europe cannot be built solely by the governments of the Member States, excluding the other public institutions. I therefore suggest we follow the examples of Germany and the previous Belgian Presidency, in which we have seen the participation of representatives of all their regions and communities. The Spanish Government, on the other hand, repeatedly blocks any participation by the autonomous communities in the European bodies, even when the latter are going to decide on the exclusive competences of those regions, as usually happens in relation to Ecofin and financial and fiscal matters, on which the autonomous communities of the Basque Country and Navarre have full sovereignty. In order to eradicate violence, I would cite the example of the British and Irish Governments, which sponsored the Good Friday agreements and the peace process in Ulster, and I would ask you and the Popular Party not to continue to insist on maintaining your alliance with Herri Batasuna
 – protectors of ETA – with the sole objective of imposing a state of political siege on the Basque Government, and instead to promote democratic dialogue with the majority of the Basque people, aimed at resolving the historic political conflict, who wish to live in peace, and to respect their right to decide their future freely.

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, today, we want to strengthen the new, not only economic, but political and social, identity of Europe. I think that in order to do this we need to find a new internal structure that is suited to the reality of our diversity. Our present reality is not, however, simply shaped by the Member States alone, but there is a greater diversity and richness, represented culturally and socially by the historic peoples and nations of Europe and, politically, by the federated States, constitutional regions and autonomous communities, in particular, and also, of course, on another level, by the purely administrative regions, the provinces and the local authorities. Do you not think, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that, by virtue of the mandate laid down in the Treaty of Nice, that in the Laeken Declaration, this question of European diversity, of the different cultural, social and political realities, should be specifically included as an important part of the debate to take place during the years 2002 and 2003 on the future of the Union and the division of competences between the institutions, in order to seek and find the best possible structure, which will allow us to share, without tension or conflict, the various, necessary levels of competence and sovereignty in existence in Europe?

Mr President, Commissioner, after the sinking of the oil tanker Erika on 12 December 1999, this Parliament and the Council requested a significant strengthening of the Community rules on maritime safety and the prevention of pollution. The Commission responded quickly to these demands by presenting the three proposals known as the Erika I package, which we are still debating two years after that disaster, although we have finally reached agreements on each of them in Council, which are definitive in the case of the first two. In the case of the modification of the Directive on the common rules and standards for organisations which classify, inspect and examine ships on behalf of the maritime administration, from the outset, the parliamentary amendments to Commission’s original proposal focussed, above all, on the practical aspects of the application of the classification system, on improving the transparency of the information relating to the quality of inspections, on the periodic auditing of those organisations and the withdrawal of their Community recognition in the event of serious accidents, as well as the financial liability of those organisations for damages and accidents where is has been proved that that there has been negligence in inspections. After the Council’s adoption of its common position, we moved on to second parliamentary reading, where we insisted on issues relating to resolving the conflicts of interest which may arise between classification societies or organisations and the owners and/or charterers of ships, as well as on financial liability in cases of negligence or omission in judgements. When the Council communicated that it could not accept all Parliament’s amendments, we moved on to the stage of conciliation between the representatives of the two Community institutions. The discussion focussed firstly on the issue of the conflict of interests, where the Council finally accepted that a classification organisation must not be controlled by owners or builders of ships or by other persons or entities which are commercially involved in the construction, equipping, repair or operation of ships. It also focussed on the idea that, at the point of requesting recognition, the classification society and its inspectors should commit themselves in writing, on an individual basis, to not accepting regulatory duties where there is a risk of a conflict of interests and, in particular, where those societies are the owners of the ship which is to be inspected, or have commercial, personal or family connections with those owners. For its part, the parliamentary delegation, while considering that much of the work of the inspectors should be done by the maritime administration and that the latter should have subsidiary responsibility, accepted that it should not be obligatory for the Member States to establish a maximum limit for the financial liability of classification societies in the event of damages due to slight negligence in inspections, although in the event that those Member States wish to establish that maximum limit, that limit should not be less that EUR 2 million and EUR 4 million respectively, depending on whether the damage only affects material objects or also people. However, the delegations of the two institutions considered that this issue should be examined within the framework of the evaluation report, which the Commission will present within three years, on the economic impact of the liability regime and, in particular, its consequences for the financial equilibrium of recognised organisations. If necessary, the Commission will present, in the light of the said evaluation, a proposal for a modification of this directive which deals specifically with the principle of liability and the maximum limit for the financial contribution. In conclusion, I believe that the European Parliament should be satisfied with the final result of the conciliation, since the majority of our amendments have been incorporated, either fully, in a revised form or in spirit, into the joint text, and we therefore propose that this latter text be approved by the House at third reading. Finally, I would like to draw the attention of the relevant legal authorities to the fact that certain people harmed by the Erika accident are yet to receive any compensation for the damage suffered, despite the fact that two years have passed since this tragic event took place.

 Mr President, we have approved the new regulation on action by Member States in the liberalisation of public transport services by rail, road and inland waterway, in order that this may be consolidated as a new single European market. And, with regard to this, our Parliamentary Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled various amendments aimed at preserving aspects relating to the environment and sustainability in the transportation market, such as the rational use of energy and the fulfilment of standards on the control of emissions which contaminate the atmosphere, greenhouse gases, noise, etc, as well as giving priority to alternative forms of transport which make a better contribution to the much hoped-for reduction in traffic congestion. We have argued for the need to defend the quality of transport services, whether these be run by public or private companies, and we have stated that social conditions with regard to the health and safety of employees in these companies should be closely linked to the quality of services offered. We also think that liberalisation should not lead to an abandonment of the idea that passenger transportation is a social instrument and which supports the weakest groups in society, such as schoolchildren, trainees, pensioners and those living with some kind of disability, all of whom should continue to be protected through restrictions on ticket prices. Ticket prices should be standardised in order to facilitate the integration and interoperability of different transportation methods, including cross-border transportation, where timetables and service networks also need to be coordinated. Transport should be cheap and available throughout all regions, and should also guarantee a service to less populated and less prosperous areas at moderate prices. Finally, it is not acceptable to liberalise urban, suburban and regional transportation whilst remaining, as some governments are, opposed to the liberalisation of state transportation, as for example the passenger railways. Although it should be controlled, this market should be open to free competition throughout the EU.

 Mr President, open access to the port services market and equal opportunities in this field are not only appropriate but also a requirement of the Treaties on which the European Union is founded. Regulation and control are needed in this particular field to ensure that no State provides financial assistance to its ports, since this is a serious threat to free competition between Community ports. However, there are certain aspects which should not be exclusively regulated by the EU. Member States and their constitutional bodies with competencies in this field should maintain their capacity to include their own specific standards for the invitation to tender for contracts for supply of port services and for the protection of workers affected. Additionally, pilotage, mooring and the handling of cargo, including stowage and trans-shipment, since they are compulsory services, should not be included in the Community Directive liberalising port services, but their regulation should remain under the control of the Member States and their port authorities, for reasons of the safety of maritime traffic. In an airport, there would be chaos if there were more than one company providing air traffic control. In a port, there should only be one authority for pilotage and one for mooring, for the same reason.

Mr President, for years European shipyards have been condemning the dumping practised by South Korea in relation to the sales prices of the ships built there. Finally, and after so many complaints about it, the Commission has presented an initiative, with the acquiescence of the Council, and has proposed certain provisional measures to us, which consist of a temporary defence mechanism, specifically designed to counteract Korea’s unfair practices, putting a complaint procedure before the World Trade Organisation. Nevertheless, the Commission, in its proposed aid to ship building, only includes container ships and oil tankers. We believe that it should also include special ships for the transportation of gases derived from oil and liquefied natural gas, as well as ferries, bulk carriers and roll-on roll-off car ferries, all of which are included in the complaints presented to the WTO. It is time that Korea realised that the Union is determined to defend its shipbuilding industry in the face of unfair practices by any other country.

Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the European Council has been able to differentiate between Arab and Muslim religion and society, on the one hand, and fanatical Islamic terrorist groups on the other. However, in its conclusions of 21 September, the European Council expresses the need, as you have said, to combat any nationalist tendency, as if to be nationalist were a crime in itself or an attack on human rights. Does the Council not agree that to stress the need to combat peaceful nationalism, which defends the universal right to free self-determination, something which the United Nations approved, by exclusively democratic means, could be seen as a display of intolerance and fascism on the part of the governments of the European Union? While it is true that there are radical nationalist groups, which support terrorism, there are also violent groups with unionist or environmentalist ideologies which also commit violent acts. Does the Council therefore believe that we should combat British unionism or environmentalism, for example, in all its forms? Would it not be better to show prudence and democratic respect whenever we refer to nationalism, unionism, environmentalism or any other ideology?

 Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on behalf of whom I am speaking, put forward ten or so amendments to the draft budget with regard to the four Community initiatives (URBAN, INTERREG, EQUAL and LEADER), for safety and sustainability in transport and tourism. Despite the current circumstances following the tragic events of 11 September, tourism will soon be the largest service industry in the European Union. The World Tourism Organisation anticipates a doubling in the number of tourist arrivals up to a figure of approximately 720 million per year by the year 2020. The 9 million people who already work in the tourism industry will be joined by a further 2 to 3.5 million between now and 2010, to reach 12.5 million people employed. The Committee on Budgets, however, rejected our proposals. Fortunately, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has once again been able to put forward an amendment to this House so that, at European level, resources are assigned to stimulate the promotion, monitoring and evaluation of a tourism policy that is both ecological and socially sustainable. I trust that the majority of my fellow Members here will have the sensitivity necessary to support this reaffirmed proposal with their vote.

Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in the Councils of Ministers, decisions are often adopted which affect the exclusive legislative competences of historic nations such as the Basque Country, Catalonia or Scotland, of regions such as Flanders or Wallonia, of federal states such as Bavaria, Baden-Baden, Rhineland, etc. Do you not believe that, in the event of a conflict of competences resulting from decisions adopted in the Council without the presence or acquiescence of the historic nations, regions or federal states affected, the latter constitutional entities should be empowered to present their case to the European Court of Justice, since that Court has the power under the Treaty to hear and pass judgment on these conflicts? Do you not believe that the European Council at Laeken should include these issues in the future debate on the Union and the distribution of competences between the Union, the Member States and the other institutional bodies?

Mr President, Commissioner, in recent decades the per capita GDP in Europe has been reduced in comparison with that of America, increasing the gap or distance between our prosperity and development and that of the United States, while our levels of employment are also worsening. The conclusion is drawn from this that the Americans do not hinder the activities of private companies through taxation as much as Europeans do and, in accordance with low levels of public expenditure, they have not, like us, promoted action plans, introduced bureaucratic systems or tried to guide their economic operators, who have therefore been able to dedicate themselves purely to working and generating wealth. It seems to me that this analysis does not take account of the very important fact that, over the last 30 years, levels of public investment in the European Union have been reduced to 2% of our GDP in 2000, while in the United States they have maintained a sustainable level and represent 3% of their GDP. If we add to this the fact that our per capita GDP stands at 65% of American GDP, it turns out that their average investment per citizen each year is 2.3 times greater than ours, and this is a more than notable difference which explains the differing developments of our respective economies. I believe that the short-term solution for Europe is not to reduce taxes, but rather, while achieving balanced budgets and no deficit, we must adjust our current public expenditure and increase public investment in viable projects, modernising our infrastructures, supporting technological research and development, involving research institutes and universities in private initiative and promoting training and knowledge in our society. What is completely unacceptable is the policy of the Spanish central government of Mr Aznar, which covers up its real budgetary deficit by financing it with revenue, with the monthly contributions of workers integrated into the state social security system, which compromises even further the uncertain future of pensions, and the workers who are currently contributing do not know whether they will receive those pensions on retirement. This is unacceptable and must be condemned.

Mr President, the first thing that the annual reports on cohesion policy for 1999 point out is that the results have been very poor. During the eleven and seven years, respectively, which these Community Funds have been operating, the average per capita income in Spain, Greece and Portugal, which in 1988 stood at 68%, has risen to 79% of the European average in 1999. In other words, it has increased by an average of one point per year. At this rate, it would take 21 more years for the whole of the European Union to achieve an equal level. I have serious doubts about the political will to eliminate the differences and the genuine solidarity of the governments of the Union. And I say this because, as Mr Nogueira has pointed out, in 1999 the Funds of the cohesion policy for 92-99 represented 0.46% of GDP, while those from Agenda 2000 until 2006 will only represent 0.31%, that is to say, they will be reduced by 15 points. Furthermore, there are some who do not intend to increase their contributions but nevertheless, through these reduced amounts, expect to show solidarity with the new Eastern States which will be part of the enlarged EU. Mr President, if we are really committed to equal opportunities, solidarity and a genuine united Europe, we must stop being miserly and we must all give more money, especially the richest amongst us, for the benefit of the poorest.

Mr President, I belong to and represent the Basque Nationalist Party, the party which has been governing the Basque Country uninterruptedly for more than twenty years. It is a party which, while calling for an independent personality, sovereignty and a right to self-determination for the Basque people, nevertheless firmly rejects and condemns the use of violence and terror as instruments to achieve any political objective and, even more, condemns the unacceptable State terrorism, which we Basques have also suffered, perpetrated by the apparatus of the Spanish State. Our society and Spanish society clearly have a special sensitivity in relation to the issues dealt with by Mr Watson in his complex report on the role of the EU in the fight against terrorism and, in general terms, we agree with the content of the report and also with the amendments presented by the Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left and my own from the Greens/European Free Alliance. Northern Ireland was lucky enough to enjoy the decisive support of US Senator Mitchell, which led to the Good Friday agreements and a genuine peace process, despite the ups and downs that it is suffering along the way. How long will we Basques have to wait for Europe to realise that peace is in its hands, that it must stimulate, promote and oversee a sincere and democratic dialogue between the opposing sides? That would be the best recipe the European Parliament could recommend against terrorism and in order to achieve peace. I particularly value Recital O of the report, which makes it very clear that democratic dialogue based on mutual respect and non-violence is the best means of resolving conflicts, thereby rectifying previous resolutions by this very European Parliament. What I regret is that the attempt to reflect this same idea in the final recommendations has failed. I must, therefore, consider this document to be incomplete and insufficient. However, despite this insufficiency and having reflected on it, I am going to vote in favour of the Watson report in order to give an opportunity to Recital O, that is to say, to democratic dialogue as a means for resolving our conflict.
