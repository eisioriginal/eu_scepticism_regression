 Enlargement is a very complex question and should be analysed from all points of view, from economic considerations to geopolitical repercussions and potential social impact. Above all at a time of economic crisis I think that it is advisable to be as prudent as possible and to learn from the mistakes of the past. I do not share the rapporteur’s view that the EU should launch a campaign in favour of enlargement in the candidate countries, since I do not believe that enlargement has proved successful in all cases or that visa liberalisation has always proved beneficial. For these reasons I did not vote in favour of the proposal. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I would like to congratulate Mr Kelam for his work on a relatively new problem for the EU, but which will be increasingly important in the future. Cyberspace brings new challenges in an ever more interconnected and globalised world. A global and coordinated approach is needed to face these challenges at EU level through the development of a comprehensive EU cyber security strategy within the framework of a wider ranging cooperation with the US, with Brazil, Russia, India and China, and with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.

 Italy applied for financial assistance from the EU Solidarity Fund following the series of earthquakes that struck on 20 May 2012. A heavy earthquake with a magnitude of 5.9 on the Richter scale affected wide parts of Northern Italy and caused severe damage in many towns and villages, in particular around the epicentre, mostly in the provinces of Modena and Ferrara in the region of Emilia-Romagna. On 29 May, a second strong earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 on the Richter scale occurred with the epicentre slightly to the west. Both events were followed by several serious aftershocks. The earthquakes caused 27 deaths, an estimated 350 people were injured and over 45 000 people had to be evacuated. The Italian authorities estimated total damage at EUR 13 273 736 063. Despite the financial difficulties affecting the 2012 budget, I think it is necessary and right for Parliament to send a signal to the victims of these disasters to help them at this difficult time.

 I support the adoption of this trade Protocol between the EU and Israel, not just because Israel offers an interesting development opportunity to our enterprises in the fishery and agricultural sectors, but more particularly because I am opposed to exploiting trade relations with Israel for political ends. Bringing political pressure to bear in matters of trade on the one hand damages the interests of our enterprises and on the other gives an increasingly one-sided image of the EU in the Middle-Eastern conflict, undermining its credibility. I hope that this protocol, like the Agreements on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of industrial products, will be approved as quickly as possible. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 The conflict between Israel and Hamas and other terrorist factions operating in Gaza is asymmetric. On the one hand there is a state that has the right and the duty, like any other state, to protect its citizens from the over 5 000 missiles and rockets launched since 2005, and on the other a terrorist organisation the aim of which is the destruction of the State of Israel, deliberately targeting civilians in order to terrorise the population. The situation is even more worrying if we consider the military and financial support provided by Iran to Hamas and the ambiguous role played by the new Egypt, in which the Muslim Brotherhood is increasingly influential. To forget these facts and turn the victim into the aggressor is not only to encourage extremism but also to allow extremists to voice the claims of the Palestinian people. It is unrealistic to believe that peace can be achieved with Hamas. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I support Mr Bové’s report on promoting the tastes of Europe. Farmers, and especially small-scale farmers, increasingly need aid and legal instruments to cope with global competition in agricultural markets both within the EU and internationally. I think the policy to promote local markets through the development of products with low food miles and information about origin and quality is particularly important for guaranteeing better incomes for farmers. This approach could prove particularly important in mountainous areas where in-quota agriculture is one of the most important ways of preventing the abandonment and degradation of the land and the environment.

 I agree with Ms Costa’s motion on protecting children in the digital world. It has been calculated that children spend up to 40 hours a week in front of the television and are online for 88 minutes a day. In many cases children enter into contact with the internet well before they start schooling. I am therefore convinced of the need to protect them from harmful and violent content, as well as violations of their privacy, through European legislation on the subject. Fiorello Provera,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ‘obscenity’ is the Taliban’s accusation against the 14-year-old Malala, who asked to go to school and for the right to education for girls in Pakistan, and the accusation of obscenity is the excuse to strike Malala down with two shots from a firearm, one to the head and the other to the shoulder. The Taliban’s attack not only has religious or political motivations, but aims to suppress and wipe out fundamental human rights and deny women dignity and the right to education. Such is the culture and lifestyle model the Taliban propose to the Muslim world, with utter contempt for their own lives and the lives of others. We obviously condemn these cowardly and cruel acts, but we would like ‘moderate’ Islam as a whole to raise its voice with us, to condemn these criminals. To remain silent would mean agreeing and conniving, and that is intolerable. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again when we discuss relations between the EU and Israel, this House has divided along ideological lines and dragged a technical agreement into the area of political opposition, ignoring its content. The agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) is not an upgrading of relations between the EU and Israel; this is not an international legal measure defining frontiers and establishing rights of sovereignty. The legal services of Parliament and the Commission have approved it, underlining that the ACAA with Israel does not go beyond the existing legal framework. This is a technical agreement that will allow many European citizens easier access to quality medicinal products at a lower price, with considerable savings for our national health services. Italy will save about EUR 1 billion annually, a considerable sum in these difficult economic times. I therefore think that this agreement should be supported. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Under the Geneva agreement, Russia too has accepted the need for a compromise based on a transition process agreed by the government and by the rebels, whereby the opposition and Mr Assad’s regime would have to share power. At this point it is important to ensure opposition unity on a shared political platform, at least on some key points. We must avoid the Balkanisation of the conflict and its degeneration into combat between ethnic or religious groups. The future must bring a secular, democratic and tolerant Syrian society. Unfortunately, however, there has been recent news of attacks on the Christian community, which fuels fears of possible persecution by a new theocratic and Islamic fundamentalist regime in Syria. Europe must do everything it can to ensure that what happens in Egypt with the Coptic Christian community or in Libya between the various clans also happens in Syria. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have said, this is a protocol of a technical nature relating to the production of pharmaceutical products, and has already been negotiated by the Commission and approved by the Council in 2010. It cannot be considered as an upgrade of relations with Israel, as Baroness Ashton declared here in Parliament. The Commission has also stated that no changes are needed to this agreement and, moreover, the high quality of the medicinal products involved and the economic benefits for national health care systems have been confirmed. The Italian health care system, for example, would save millions of euro in patient care costs. My conviction is that in fact, opposition to this agreement is of a purely political nature, with the aim of boycotting Israel. Those who oppose this agreement for political reasons should therefore also oppose trade agreements with China, which is occupying Tibet, with Russia, occupying part of Georgia, Armenia, occupying Nagorno-Karabakh, and with any states guilty of serious human rights violations, which amounts to two-thirds of humanity.

 The appointment of a European Representative for Human Rights is intended to increase the visibility of European policy in this area. Greater visibility also means greater accountability and the need to report regularly to Parliament on this especially sensitive subject. I support this initiative. Appointing a Special Representative for Human Rights will enable the EU human rights strategy and the associated action plan to be implemented more effectively, by formulating recommendations, by stepping up dialogue with third countries, international, regional and non-governmental organisations active in this sector, by fostering overall coherence in EU action on human rights, and by integrating this dimension across all areas of the Union’s external action. I therefore support Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra’s report. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 The increasing use of the Internet and computer-based technologies makes Internet security a priority. The use and deployment of innovative information and communication technologies (ICT), such as fixed and mobile Internet and cellular networks, smart grids, Internet services such as cloud computing and the Internet of Things, all rely on one simple, but crucial aspect: security, resilience and trust. I am therefore in favour of this EU critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP) initiative to enhance ICT security and resilience at both national and European levels.

 Many people would like to see a new role for European policy in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We all want Europe to promote more effective peace initiatives than have happened so far and to take on a political role more in tune with our financial commitments in the area. To achieve that in such a complicated and difficult situation, the European Union must be seen as credible and unbiased by both parties. Both the Palestinians and the Israelis must be convinced that the Union is only interested in peace and is not prejudiced against either side. Do we really think that the European Union can be regarded as a credible partner by Israel in light of the recent consensual positions reached by the Foreign Affairs Council last May, which totally ignored Israel’s legitimate security demands, surrounded as it is by hostile countries? At a time when the hopes raised by the Arab Spring are being dashed and we see Islamic extremism prevailing in the Maghreb countries, what security assurances can be given by the new Palestinian state if it comes into being, which, by the way, is what we all hope will happen?

Mr President, I will not repeat what has already been said on the territorial dispute and on the energy issue at the root of the conflict. The result is that an agreed separation between the two States, recognised by the international community, is degenerating into a large-scale armed conflict. Another tragic result is that in the Blue Nile region, controlled by the Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement, Sudan is blocking humanitarian aid destined for 200 000 people. As well as providing humanitarian aid, I would like to see Europe conducting a policy that is more committed to supporting the African Union, and not so much in opposition to the Chinese presence or influence in the area, but in order to strengthen pan-African politics and ensure that Africa belongs, a little more, to Africans.

 I would like to thank Ms de Sarnez for her in-depth and meticulous analysis of trade relations between the European Union and China. The results of indiscriminately opening the European market to Chinese goods are there for all to see: relocations and massive job losses in Europe; average annual Chinese growth of 9% while European countries suffer a serious recession; the impotence of European trade policy; and not forgetting that 83% of counterfeit goods seized at the EU’s external borders come from China. In light of all this, we need to respond by asking for at least a certain level of reciprocity from the Chinese in very sensitive sectors such as public procurement and service provision.

 The economic crisis currently affecting Europe is so serious that it is necessary to take more decisive action to protect our industry and our small and medium-sized enterprises, especially when they are subject to dumping or other unfair conduct by operators in countries where there is no rule of law and the safeguarding of social and environmental rights is effectively non-existent. The fact that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has decided to accept a claim from China against the already rather unambitious anti-dumping regulation in force in Europe is, instead, a step in the other direction, which makes it harder to safeguard our businesses and our jobs. Therefore, I cannot agree with the content of this regulation, which could further compound the difficulties of our businesses. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 The Commission should not underestimate the importance of ‘regional airports’, which are distinct from ‘hub airports’ in that their function is mainly tied to the area in which they are located. Unfortunately, these airports are increasingly neglected by EU legislation and have been given secondary importance in recent proposals on the development of the EU transport network. I share Mr Bradbourn’s stance on the monopolisation of many regional airports by individual airlines and their isolation by the transport network. We need to block unfair practices, such as the ‘one bag’ rule imposed by airlines, which cuts passenger spending in airports by up to 70%, with repercussions on the local economies linked to regional airports.

 Mr Rinaldi’s report is very ambitious and gives us a chance to reflect on the effects – and also the causes – of the so-called ‘Arab Spring’. In contrast to the rapporteur, however, I think the view that has been set out is too optimistic and that many of the proposed measures are more pertinent to development cooperation than to international trade. The growing instability and increasingly extremist political trends which are increasingly being seen in countries such as Egypt and Libya prevent me from sharing in the overall feeling of confidence over the so-called ‘Arab Spring’ and the rather premature comparison, in my view, with the fall of the Berlin Wall. The ‘more for more’ principle should be at the heart of EU policy on Mediterranean countries and any increase in European contributions ought to be dependent on real reforms designed to bring about thoroughgoing democracy in these countries. Only then will we be able to discuss a possible review of tariff barriers. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, freedom of worship seems increasingly in danger and, in particular, cases of discrimination and persecution against Christians are becoming increasingly widespread in the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, recently in Nigeria, in South-East Asia, China, India, Pakistan and North Korea. In these countries, there are numerous cases of forced emigration, attacks and arson against places of worship and religious structures, torture and killings, kidnappings and forced conversions. Not less than 10% of Christians around the world, in other words, 200 million people, are minorities in their own countries and potential victims of discrimination. Religious freedom is a fundamental human right, as we all know, but both the European Union and international human rights organisations are, unfortunately, still not very effective at reporting violations and protecting this right. I therefore wish to reiterate the proposal already advanced on other occasions, to set up a specific, accurate, and annual report by the European Parliament to monitor the status of religious freedom in the world and strongly denounce violations where they exist.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what I hope we can do is draw up a thorough report on any violation of freedom of worship, wherever it occurs, and whatever religion is prevented from being upheld, practised or pursued by anyone in the world. Not a discriminatory report against any one religion, but a report that starts from acknowledging the growing number of attacks on Christians around the world, which are becoming more severe and more numerous, as I have already said. I believe, given that this Parliament regards the protection of human rights and of all human rights as fundamental, that the protection of religious rights is perhaps the most fundamental, since they are based not only on human needs but on morals, and therefore we must be united in defending them, and in doing so, we are consistent with the objectives of this Parliament and are consistent with the defence of human rights, which has repeatedly been hailed around the world as a victory for civilisation. I am sure you will be on my side, as I am on yours. Fiorello Provera,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Kosovo is a country with enormous structural problems, as highlighted by the report itself. Chronic and widespread corruption, a judicial system that does not respond to the needs of a democratic country, a highly inefficient public administration, a serious lack of media freedom, insufficient protection of minorities even as regards cultural and religious traditions. Furthermore, the economy is very weak and environmental protection is neglected. On top of all this, crime syndicates are widespread, trafficking arms, people and drugs, as verified by international investigations and reported by authoritative media organisations. In 2010, the Council of Europe also denounced the involvement of Prime Minister Thaçi in organ smuggling and other criminal activities. All of this shows that we are a long way from any suggestion of possible integration, even though we have a duty to accompany Kosovo in its social and democratic development.

 I am against the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia joining the European Union in the immediate future. I agree with the rapporteur’s view that there has been some progress – in fact, important progress; you just have to look at the latest elections, the economic reforms and at the end of the Parliamentary boycott. However, I am puzzled at the idea of accession, because there is still too great a distance between the social and political institutions of this Balkan state and those of the EU Member States. The rushed accession of a country in which there is separation and mistrust between ethnic groups could create a breeding ground for tensions within the EU and slow down the process by which the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia moves towards becoming a pluralist society.

 I voted against this resolution, even if I agree with some of the conclusions contained in Ms Pack’s report. I am not convinced by the underlying theory, the concept that, despite the critical areas, the EU accession process of Bosnia and Herzegovina should take place without pause for thought. There are still too many question marks about the real authority of the Balkan state. There are too many concerns about the effective independence of the judicial system, which is an indispensable requirement for guaranteeing the rule of law. Finally, too many criticisms can be levelled at the country with regard to its economy. In order for the European Union to be a driver of growth and political stability, it is fundamental that there should be a certain level of convergence between Member States, and Bosnia and Herzegovina does not currently have this.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have seen, the persecutions and killings of Christians are continuing on a wide scale in Nigeria. The latest official data says that the Boko Haram armed group, which wants to convert the country to Islam, has killed 1 200 Christians in the last two years and forced 35 000 Christians to flee the country. However, in some Arab countries, too, like Egypt and Iraq, millions of Christians are discriminated against, even killed or forced into exile. There is a sort of growing religious racism against Christians that is being accepted almost with resignation or fatalism. In this situation, the international institutions, including Europe, and important political and religious figures must make their voices heard loud and strong and call upon governments to face their responsibilities. I should add that I would also like to see the so-called moderate Islamic citizens, who quite rightly reject extremism, join us in defending the rights of their Christian fellow citizens. To return to Nigeria, we have mentioned the widespread poverty, the high levels of poverty of so many millions of people in this extraordinarily rich country that could so easily provide amply for all its citizens. As Ms Sargentini says, there is a problem and that is corruption, which is so widespread and pervasive that it has altered the social structures of the country. With corruption, there is no respect for the environment, no free market, no opportunities for trade or young people, and therefore, ultimately, there is no democracy either. In actual fact, Nigeria needs a proper, qualified, extremely honest ruling class, and without this, it cannot really be considered a modern country or a democratic country. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I am in favour of many of the ideas proposed by Mr Saryusz-Wolski on the issue of relations with the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa): the idea that the EU should have its own global, comprehensive approach on the issue; the idea that the growing role of emerging countries, in particular, the BRICS, should be fully acknowledged within the framework of rules and values, above all, those enshrined in the United Nations Charter; the idea that parliamentary diplomacy can contribute decisively to the development of amicable relations, especially in those countries in which parliamentarianism is becoming established; lastly, the idea that developing full political relations with the emerging world must not disregard crucial issues such as the environment, human rights and labour conditions. By contrast, I have great doubts about the request for visa liberalisation with Brazil. Migratory dynamics are too complicated to be addressed by immediately opening up our borders, particularly at a time of economic crisis such as we are currently experiencing. It is for this reason that I decided to abstain from the vote on this report. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I agree with and support the conclusions in Mr Watson’s report. The EU is now the world’s biggest market and the largest donor of development aid. It represents a unique opportunity for promoting human rights and respect for the rules of peaceful coexistence of the community of Member States. Unfortunately, thus far, the cumbersome red tape surrounding the EU’s restrictive measures against regimes that do not respect international law, and the failure of such measures to feed into one another, have meant that they have not always had the desired effect as deterrents and sanctions. It is unjust that sometimes, peoples that are already oppressed or European companies and citizens should have suffered the consequences of sanctions, while the corrupt, violent local elites have managed to evade them. In the same way, it is equally unjust that third countries take and have taken advantage of European respect for the rule of law and fundamental rights. I therefore join Mr Watson in calling for the Council to adopt, as soon as possible, clear rules – to be applied uniformly and subject to periodic review – that will enable the restrictive measures to be more effective.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, the Arab Spring has led not only to political changes but also to new challenges and threats to stability. One of these is the growing phenomenon of arms smuggling. Since the fall of Gaddafi in Libya, the Egyptian authorities have been reporting a sharp increase in arms smuggling in the Sinai Peninsula. Surface-to-air missiles, rockets and anti-aircraft guns have been stolen from army barracks abandoned by Libyan forces and now supply a black market for weapons, destined for the Gaza Strip and Hamas in particular. This is a very worrying phenomenon because these arms are capable of shooting down civilian aircraft during take-off and landing and may end up in the hands of terrorist groups such as Al-Qaida, for example in the Maghreb. How, I ask, can we help to mitigate this growing threat and who are our potential allies? Fiorello Provera

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, it is difficult to be optimistic. If Tehran were to have nuclear weapons, it would seriously destabilise the area between the Mediterranean and the Caucasus and could trigger a nuclear arms race in neighbouring countries that for various reasons are afraid of Tehran, such as Saudi Arabia or Turkey. The latest Iranian Shahab-3 missiles can reach EU Member States such as Greece, Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria, and would make the Tehran regime’s threat to destroy the State of Israel possible. A nuclear Iran really could block the Strait of Hormuz, making any political or military countermeasures extremely risky. We cannot afford a new North Korea in the Middle East.

 The agreement signed with Georgia is an important step for the recognition of the quality of our products abroad.

For these reasons, I share in the Committee on International Trade’s unanimous approval of Mr Moreira’s report.

I agree with, and strongly support, the conclusions of Mr Patriciello on the European space strategy, in their expression both of appreciation and of concern. There is no doubt that space policy is a great opportunity for Europe because it stimulates technological innovation, because it helps to make European citizens more secure, because it creates synergies in a strategic civil and military sector, and, finally, because it creates jobs for highly qualified workers. It is therefore right that the project should play a key role in the Europe 2020 strategy. That said, it is all too plain that in terms of governance, the Commission could and should have drawn up a more ambitious plan. The failure to include it in the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020 risks undermining the investments made so far. The references to cooperation with the United States, Russia and emerging powers are too weak to frame the space policy in an international context. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I support the balanced report by Mr Cutaş. Strengthening relations between Europe and Uzbekistan is a pivotal element of our partnership with the countries of Central Asia. Furthermore, the European textiles industry, which has considerable expertise in processing raw materials, can only benefit from free trade with the world’s third biggest cotton exporter and fifth-largest producer of cotton. However, especially in the textiles industry, closer cooperation must not fail to take into account respect for human rights and for children. As the EU Presidency acknowledged in June, during the cotton harvest the Uzbekistan government uses between 200 000 and 2 million children as a source of labour, closing the schools and dismissing teachers who refuse to send their pupils to work in the plantations. This fact is a serious cause for concern. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

) With the end of the Cold War Central Asia became increasingly important on the international stage, and its importance is destined to become even greater if, as seems probable, relations between East and West continue to intensify in the next few decades. The success of our strategy therefore has a key role in maintaining stable and fruitful relations with countries in Central Asia. Unfortunately, the conclusions of the report by Ms Kiil-Nielsen appear to suggest that Europe is not moving in the right direction. Progress has certainly been made, but not enough for those who wish to establish a long-lasting partnership: we provide limited economic support to these countries; corruption is rife in their political regimes; and there is insufficient respect for fundamental rights, with systematic cases of torture, repression of political opposition and child labour. Finally, as the report points out, dangerous movements with links to Islamic fundamentalism are spreading in the area. For these reasons I voted against the report. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I am opposed to the conclusion of the agreement with Morocco as it will be beneficial neither for Moroccan fishermen nor for European taxpayers. It will not benefit Moroccan fishermen because it will not create new jobs and it will increase the imbalance that already exists between the local fleet and the fishery potential. It will not benefit European taxpayers because they will spend EUR 13.5 million on subsidising the Moroccan fisheries policy without a guarantee that the money will be used in a worthwhile manner. Furthermore, for every euro invested European taxpayers will only gain back EUR 0.65, which is less than half of the average amount generated by similar agreements. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I fully support the conclusions contained in Mr Lisek’s report. The defence sector is undoubtedly one of those most severely affected by the austerity policies implemented as a result of the economic crisis. At this rate, Europe risks being unable to shoulder its international responsibilities and seeing some of its traditional areas of strategic weakness, such as duplication of military capabilities and its inability to carry out operations without US support, intensify. In order to prevent such a scenario from occurring, and to avoid draining funds from other important expenditure headings, the only effective solution, as the report indicates, is to move towards greater cooperation within the Union, with due respect for national prerogatives. This cooperation should cover all areas of defence but, in particular, contract liberalisation, technological research, coordination of planning and sharing of certain capabilities. Greater collaboration would, moreover, enable European countries to strengthen their own strategic autonomy and increase their political influence within the Atlantic Alliance. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

There are many points with which I agree in the report tabled by Mr Siwiec and Mr David: from its emphasis on trade, to the importance it attributes to cultural ties between the younger generations in neighbouring countries and Europe; however, I do not feel I can support it. I do not agree with some of the few conclusions on immigration. The proposal to undertake a rapid liberalisation of the visa regime, for example, seems to be a proposal that will cause hardship both to the indigenous populations and to the migrants, at least until the economic and social systems of Europe and neighbouring countries resemble each other.

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, throughout the world, obstacles, including legislative obstacles, are increasing against freedom of worship. The number of attacks and murders grow each year and affect practitioners of all religions, but Christians in particular. Paradoxically, religious freedom is becoming an increasingly uncertain issue rather than one of the most natural and indisputable freedoms. In Europe and in our Parliament, we constantly proclaim our defence of human rights, but our work to guarantee religious freedoms is still rather ineffective. That is why I am in favour of the proposal, which has been put forward on other occasions, to commission a specific, accurate and yearly report by Parliament to monitor the state of religious freedoms around the world. This report would provide the necessary facts to plan appropriate and preventive political action in line with what was expressed by the High Representative to organise policies which are country-specific in terms of the needs of the country itself.

In fact, however, it has carried out research and set up facilities for military purposes, as verified in recent inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Its nuclear ambitions, which in themselves are worrying, are accompanied by a policy of internal repression and aggression towards other countries in the area, such as Saudi Arabia and particularly Israel. This threat has not only political and military repercussions but also economic and strategic ones, because it may affect oil production and thus have economic and financial consequences that would have a direct impact on us as well. A global threat needs a global response. It is therefore crucial to establish very close cooperation with the United States regarding all measures that may from time to time become necessary, such as imposing further, more incisive sanctions on Tehran. I hope it is not already too late. Fiorello Provera,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will talk about the area I know best, northern Italy. The most important issue for our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) at the moment is access to credit; it is far more important than excessive red tape, the tax burden or international competition, particularly from China. The banks are being forced to recapitalise and get rid of the debts caused by their financial speculation, and so they are not granting any more credit to SMEs, which are too small to have their own capital resources or to provide guarantees. Small businesses are therefore unable to contribute to the country’s economic recovery, even if they are willing to do so. It is therefore essential to expand credit schemes of various kinds in favour of SMEs and to improve information about the availability of the financial instruments at their disposal, the Structural Funds in particular. Without money, there is no research, no equipment renewal and no possibility of investing, and therefore it is impossible to contribute to the country’s wellbeing. Fiorello Provera,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the massacre in Egypt to prevent a demonstration to protest against the burning of a Coptic church by Salafi Muslims shows how far it still is from democracy. Quite apart from the difficulties faced by the Copts when they request authorisation to build a church, according to a law dating back to the Ottoman Empire, there are an increasing number of attacks on Christians by Muslim extremists. The protests, instead of being guaranteed by the military authorities in power in Egypt, are being repressed with bloodshed. Paradoxically, these religious conflicts and these repressions were less frequent at the time of President Mubarak. But there are other worrying signs which are disappointing for the expectations of the so-called Arab Spring. I am referring to the attack on the Israeli embassy and the subsequent withdrawal of the ambassador, the attacks on the gas pipelines in the Sinai, the requests by some political parties to revise the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel and, finally, the huge advances being made by Islamist parties. Since the EU has rightly strengthened its political and financial support for Egypt, would it not be appropriate to apply the Füle-Ashton doctrine of ‘more for more’, and therefore also of ‘less for less’, by directing aid to those political, social and trade union organisations that promote democracy and stability in Egypt?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Eastern partnership is an important political dimension for the European Union, but the obstacles to its future development are currently rather concerning. Dialogue with Belarus remains difficult, while in Ukraine, the Tymoshenko case confirms a relapse on respect for human rights as well as rampant corruption. Parts of Georgia and Azerbaijan are under military occupation and the tension between Azerbaijan and Armenia is increasing, with a risk of ensuing armed conflict. Without losing hope on the future of the Eastern partnership, we must remind these six partner countries of their responsibilities: respect for the fundamental rules of democracy and the resolution of territorial conflicts. Here, I am referring in particular to Nagorno-Karabakh and to Georgia. Europe cannot accept violations of international law guaranteeing territorial integrity as, moreover, this House has already appealed for in its resolution on the South Caucasus, and we cannot repudiate our basic principles on respect for human rights.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in a statement on 5 October Commissioners Füle and Malmström expressed their satisfaction with the outcome of discussions with Tripoli on a cooperation agenda which included the management of migration flows, border management, pan-African policy and international protection for refugees and asylum seekers. This ambitious agenda came to an end for the reasons we know – NATO’s military intervention and the change of regime in Tripoli. I believe that the first objective is to resume cooperation with Libya as soon as possible on these major issues – border management, migration flows, energy supplies and the fight against terrorism. That said, another equally important issue is to support Libya’s new leadership in organising free elections as the first step in a long process that will, I hope, one day make it possible to build a truly democratic and stable country. Building a democracy is much more difficult than winning a war, especially if there is no previous memory of democracy in the country. I wanted to know what practical plans can be put in place in the short term to take action within civil society, especially in culture and education, which are key elements for building a true democracy in people’s hearts and minds.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is convinced that it is both opportune and necessary to create two states which can live together and in peace. The difference of opinion merely lies in understanding how to achieve these goals. The Palestinian Authority’s intention of unilaterally applying to the United Nations for recognition as a state is an initiative which, in my opinion, could harm the peace process and spark off chain reactions in the Middle East. There is clearly an intention to isolate Israel in a diplomatic sense and to present it with a fait accompli
, right at a time when the peace agreements with Egypt are threatened by extremist positions and relations with Turkey are in crisis. The episode of the attack on the Israeli embassy in Cairo is the latest link in this chain. The unilateral initiative by the Palestinians is in conflict with the principle shared by both parties, according to which the only solution to the conflict is bilateral negotiations between the parties. Unilateral recognition could therefore create further instability and make it even more difficult to build a democratic Palestinian state that could live in peace with Israel. I therefore hope that there will be a return to the key principles of the Oslo Accords, based on mutual recognition, peaceful coexistence, security and political rights. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I would like to thank Mrs De Keyser for having wished to develop some points from the report on migration flows arising from instability, which was recently adopted by the European Parliament. In particular, the report insists on the importance of a global, coherent approach based on targeted strategies relating to development, human rights, good governance, social inclusion and promotion of women’s and minority rights in order to promote democracy. I agree with the need to build strong coalitions with other actors on the world stage such as the African Union and the Arab League, in order to promote democratic values more effectively, and for more coordination with the United States.

 Although 156 countries have now signed the Ottawa Convention on the prohibition of the use of mines, some 37 countries have still not signed. Europe should therefore urge those states to sign and ratify the convention. I share the opinion expressed by the rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, which underlines the consequences of the use of mines, both from a humanitarian and from an economic point of view, because in addition to the grief and the mutilation of victims, mines stop vast swathes of land being used for human activities.

 I fully support this report by Mrs Tzavela. The development of broadband can, in fact, be useful for economic recovery, for the support that it guarantees to innovation and the possibility of making transactions faster and simpler. The implementation of high-speed broadband networks in Europe is extremely important for the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. The development of broadband is particularly important for disadvantaged regions, such as mountainous areas, in which new technology can support the creation and facilitate the activities of new small and medium-sized enterprises, leading to the possibility of creating new jobs.

 Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the Nagorno-Karabakh issue is little known and often by means of biased information, but a clear point, which is indisputable and, I would say, fundamental, is the principle of territorial integrity of a sovereign state. The inviolability of borders must be respected: this is the case in Georgia, Moldova, Cyprus and so in Azerbaijan. There have been numerous positions adopted on the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and the following have been pointed out: the 2008 Helsinki declaration, four United Nations Security Council resolutions and even our Parliament has given its views on this issue. The territorial integrity of a sovereign state is guaranteed by international law and questioning this principle means encouraging future military attacks and attempts to change the international status quo, with destabilising consequences for the whole world. Europe has a particular interest in resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh issue because Armenia and Azerbaijan fall within the scope of the Eastern Partnership project which expressly provides for stability and collaboration between partner countries. We should therefore work towards this. Lastly, I would point out that time consolidates Armenia’s position in the occupied territories and this makes an agreement more difficult and the situation in the area riskier.

I share the approach of the rapporteur Mrs Lepage, which intends to give Member States the right to prohibit the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on grounds other than those related to health and the environment, which are assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).

 Without a legally binding global international agreement under which the other industrialised nations undertake to make equivalent commitments and emerging countries undertake to make suitable efforts, there are not sufficient grounds for a unilateral increase in the EU emissions reduction target for 2020. It is too early to recognise the Commission’s evaluation of a possible 25% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels, should the EU objective of increasing energy efficiency be met (20% increase by 2020). Before proceeding along these lines a careful examination is required, along with a thorough investigation of the implications in terms of costs. Within the framework of international climate negotiations, recognition of this result at this stage does not seem appropriate, because in the eyes of the other parties it detracts from the unilateral commitment already made by the European Union (-20% by 2020). It is also too early to recognise the milestones identified on the roadmap, before carrying out the necessary investigations for evaluating the implications for Member States. In view of these considerations, I voted against the report. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Europe is characterised by great territorial diversity and polycentric development. In this context, Europe’s cities represent centres of economic activity, innovation and employment, but they must face up to a number of challenges. I welcome the fact that, under this Urban Agenda, the issue regarding the definition of the concept ‘urban’ is left to the Member States in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. There will thus be more opportunity to adapt interventions according to the demands of each Member State. For this reason I welcomed and voted in favour of this measure. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

I concur with the rapporteur in affirming the great importance of ‘territorial cooperation’, which aims to remove physical, administrative and regulatory obstacles and reduce the ‘border effect’ between regions, promoting their harmonious development. This new approach will also be relevant to mountain regions which could similarly play a leading role in realising the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. However, in order to realise these objectives, territorial cooperation programmes will have to be simplified, and local authorities and the public will need to be more involved by encouraging better communication through a large-scale media and awareness-raising campaign.

 Economic, social and territorial cohesion are fundamental principles in determining all EU policies and activities. I share the rapporteur’s view that the economic crisis will force us to be more innovative and to seek a bigger impact from the available funding. Innovation means creating synergies and an integrated approach between the different sectoral policies in order to achieve the optimal result for growth and development on the ground. I particularly agree with the rapporteur’s assertion that synergies and coordination do not imply one-size-fits-all solutions, but call for close strategic coordination between instruments, policies and actors in order to produce carefully designed interventions and programmes which take into account the territorial specificities and comparative advantages or special features of each region in an integrated place-based approach.

 In a large internal market like Europe’s, there is a need to ensure that consumers’ rights are protected. Mr Schwab’s report has the aim of merging four different directives: those on off-premises sales, on distance sales, on guarantees and on unfair contract terms. It is difficult to reconcile 27 different legal traditions on these subjects. This is probably not the most appropriate point in history to issue regulations of this complexity. It would have been more opportune, in my view, to concentrate on specific aspects and sectors, rather than to try and create a new competency shared between the EU and the Member States. In fact, for certain states, this directive will represent an over-large and over-enthusiastic step forward, while other countries will have to make concessions in the name of European harmonisation. For this reason, although I acknowledge the great effort made by Mr Schwab, I cannot vote in favour of this report. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 This directive is designed to ensure that Member States establish a national regulatory and organisational framework and draw up appropriate national programmes for spent fuel and radioactive waste management, regardless of the perspectives of nuclear power and non-power applications. The Commission’s position is commendable: it makes the Member States responsible for the safe management, including disposal, of the spent fuel and radioactive waste that they generate, through the development of their own programmes. On the other hand, many of the amendments incorporated in the text are questionable. On such a sensitive issue as this, maximum transparency and public information are crucial. However, choices of this kind cannot be restricted to public participation in decision-making alone. In fact, the danger of not laying down precise rules is that we will fail to take the decisions necessary to ensure the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste. For this reason I cannot support this report. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have seen that no country can face the problem of immigration alone. It is essential to have a policy governing large migration movements that supports development cooperation and provides for multilateral and bilateral agreements with the migrants’ countries of origin and of transit. Unfortunately, the new European external action instruments have not been used in the spirit or with the vision of the Treaties, as Italy is now finding. The front-line Member States have in fact had to face the refugee crisis by means of unilateral initiatives, without being able to rely on European solidarity. I therefore call on the Commission to define the cases in which we can talk of a ‘mass influx of displaced persons’ under the terms of Directive 2001/55/EC on temporary protection, thereby setting precise, measurable criteria that can be regarded as permanent. Such clarification is important for promoting an effective common policy on migration and ensuring that the burden is shared. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

The Balkan region is one of the most sensitive areas of the EU’s external borders in terms of illegal migration. This phenomenon is of great significance and has repercussions on the daily lives of many of our citizens, exacerbating the insecurity they face. Before being able to think about the possible admittance of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area, special and detailed plans must be drawn up to contain migratory pressures. In addition, improving controls at external borders must be combined with fighting the corruption of local authorities. I voted against this measure for the reasons stated and to better protect our citizens against illegal immigration. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Through this measure, we are at last able to express our desire to improve the work of rating agencies by enhancing their transparency, integrity, responsibility, independence and reliability. While recognising the role of agencies in supplying information and stimulating market liquidity, it is now quite clear that financial operators have placed too much faith in their judgments and that their actions contributed to causing the financial crisis. There is too much dependence on external credit rating agencies and an oligopoly exists in the sector. I am therefore in favour of establishing an independent European Credit Rating Foundation with responsibility for ratings in the public sector, for companies and for structured finance instruments.

European legislation is too often complex, difficult to understand and difficult to apply. This is why impact assessments can make a significant contribution to improving the quality of EU law making, particularly in terms of reducing the timescales and costs of the legislative process.

Impact assessments should also be completely independent and transparent and be carried out in the early stages of the legislative process. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 The Galileo system will improve the accuracy and the reliability of US Global Positioning System (GPS) information. This new system will be important for ensuring Europe’s autonomy and independence from other global navigation systems and enabling it to claim a share of this booming worldwide high-tech market. As we know, the programme is funded fully by the Union budget with a budget of EUR 3.4 billion until 2014. We know that the indirect benefits of the programme are estimated to be around EUR 60 billion per year, but the Commission has admitted that additional investment will be required in order to reach full operational capacity. As it is not clear how much the Galileo system will cost the taxpayer, I abstained on this measure, not least to reiterate the request to the Commission to clarify the project’s future costs.

 Mr President, the dialogue between the European Union and Russia must be expanded as much as possible in various areas, from the economy to human rights, because there are no alternatives to dialogue. Europe and Russia are, in fact, interdependent, both economically and politically. I am thinking of unresolved international issues such as energy security, the Maghreb, Iran’s nuclear capability, terrorism, the Caucasus, Nagorno-Karabakh, climate change and others. Russia is a strategic partner for Europe, not least because of the synergies that may be built in future. As already happens to some extent, Moscow can supply us with mineral and energy resources as well as collaborate on military security and the fight against terrorism and organised crime Europe can contribute with financial resources, scientific and technological capabilities and our long-standing experience in the field of democracy and human rights. Russia’s future is linked to Europe’s and must be developed with perseverance, without complacency and despite the many difficulties that currently exist. In that respect, the conclusion of the strategic partnership agreement between the European Union and Russia is of great importance for our common future. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Sudan, the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa, is a crossroads between the Arab and African worlds, as well as a mosaic of many heterogeneous ethnic groups. It has seen numerous conflicts since its independence from the United Kingdom in 1956. With the signing of the Naivasha Agreement and the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) (2005), 20 years of conflict between the north and south formally came to an end. In January 2011, as provided for in the CPA, a referendum marked the last leg of the road towards the independence of the south from northern Sudan. In this extremely delicate transition phase, we must keep a balanced approach to both north and south, with particular attention to the needs of the south regarding institution building and governance. The aid given by the EU to South Sudan must be measured in terms of the effective capability of this new state to absorb it. Indeed, we must ensure that future flows of funding to Juba do not end up being used inappropriately or, worse, adding to the already widespread corruption. Europe should also increase its commitment to protect the Christian minorities in the north of the country, who are increasingly the targets of persecution and discrimination. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Azerbaijan actively participates in the European Neighbourhood Policy, is one of the EU’s six Eastern partners, and is among the founders of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly. The core values of these three initiatives are respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law. These initiatives are intended to foster a continuous political dialogue that can deepen ties between member countries and enable Europe to accompany them along the path to reform. We believe that the instrument of the emergency resolution may be inadequate or even counterproductive to the achievement of the desired goal, namely, Azerbaijan steadily progressing towards its objectives of full and modern democracy. The institutions set up under the agreements reached at interparliamentary and intergovernmental level are intended to achieve these ends; these are the right place to demand explanations for possible infringements of rights and effectively encourage good behaviour and democratic reforms.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the attacks on Coptic churches in Egypt and the killing of Christians are signs that religious intolerance is worsening, betraying the spirit of unity shown in Tahrir Square, where Copts and Muslims demonstrated together against the regime. Coexistence and social stability are essential for an orderly transition to democracy, but they are made impossible by this lack of tolerance. The authorities in Cairo must therefore make a greater commitment to protect minorities and to oppose Salafi extremism, which is a negation of the principles of modern democracy to which the Egyptian people aspire. Economic development, with the resumption of foreign investment and, above all, tourism, is unthinkable without tolerance, order and stability. It is therefore in the interests of Egypt and the world that Europe should grant generous aid, but this aid must be conditional upon an effective policy to protect minorities, in line with the ‘more for more’ principle that you, Baroness Ashton, proposed together with Commissioner Füle.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to Bahrain. This little country lies in a strategic position in terms of the balance of the Gulf and energy supply distribution. The presence of a major oil refinery for Saudi crude is well known. I would like to draw your attention to one aspect of this situation which seems particularly worrying to me. Reliable sources have identified Iranian influence on the Shi’ite population of Bahrain. This is in addition to the legitimate aspirations for more substantial reforms in the government of that country. It is difficult to determine how much weight outside influence has had on the recent events in Bahrain, but there is a risk of destabilisation of the region that could extend to eastern regions of Saudi Arabia, home to another large group of Shi’ites. Iran funds Hamas, supports Hezbollah in Lebanon and influences the internal politics of Iraq, where Shi’ite Islam is the predominant component of the government. If the disruption of balance spread to the Gulf, the impact would be obvious and there could be global repercussions. We must be very careful in assessing what happens in the Middle East and distinguish the legitimate aspirations of peoples for greater democracy from external influences which have strategic ambitions in the area.

When we review the European Neighbourhood Policy, it is important to assess the impact of this policy on migration. No Neighbourhood Policy can be fully effective in this area without tackling the causes of instability that trigger migration. This entails regional cooperation, potentially via bilateral agreements, with both the countries of origin and with transit countries. We must cooperate with transit countries and with countries of origin for migration so as to prevent surges. We must help the migrants’ countries of origin to democratise and attain good governance by giving them access to our values and our experience. With regard to the European Neighbourhood Policy, we need an economic agenda which can increase levels of employment and trade agreements that can generate real, market-driven, economic development. Commissioner Füle and High Representative Ashton support, with the ‘more for more’ formula, the concept of conditions for aid which aim to reward the countries most active in terms of democratic reforms and respect for human rights. This approach should be encouraged, as it is consistent with our values, effective for development, and does right by European taxpayers. Fiorello Provera,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this tragically topical own-initiative report was first drawn up more than a year ago to assess the phenomenon of immigration and its structural causes in a pragmatic and balanced manner, regardless of political or ideological prejudices. We wanted to investigate the role of foreign policy and its ability to have an effect on the deep-seated causes of immigration, beyond humanitarian or emergency causes. Wars, ethnic tensions, persistent climate change, human rights violations, a lack of civil and economic liberties, endemic corruption, a lack of institutional representatives of citizens’ needs, such as trade unions, associations, political parties: the set of all these elements represents the field of deployment of European foreign policy and resolving these problems will remove many of the reasons that cause millions of people to emigrate. No development cooperation policy can be fully effective without tackling the causes of instability in migrants’ countries of origin. This involves regional cooperation with both with the country of origin and the country of transit, including through bilateral agreements. The Millennium Development Goals are already very ambitious, but certainly will not be achieved without political stability and without implementing effective mechanisms for preventing conflicts and maintaining peace. The global reach of this policy and its holistic approach require clear ideas and substantial financial resources that are difficult to come by in this moment of crisis. It is therefore advisable to coordinate the actions of the Union with those of other major powers such as the United States to avoid duplication of funding in the same areas or dispersal of financial resources, as has often happened in the past. A global phenomenon must be dealt with by a global policy. We must lead the migrants’ countries of origin to democracy and good governance by making available our values and our experience. Under the European Neighbourhood Policy, we should offer an economic agenda that can increase levels of employment and trade agreements that can generate real economic development consistent with market laws. Commissioner Füle and the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, drew attention, with the slogan ‘more for more’, to the concept of conditionality of aid which aims to reward countries that are most actively setting out on the road to democratic reforms and respect for human rights. This is consistent with our European values, effective for development and – if you will allow me – morally fair to taxpayers. I would like to conclude by stating that a European policy for the management of large migration flows should go hand in hand with acceptance of the concept of ‘burden sharing’, in line with the duty of State solidarity under Article 80 of the Treaty, because no country can face up to an emergency of enormous proportions by itself. Finally, I thank Commissioner Malmström for her support for some or many points in this report, and I hope that Europe can actually work with Italy to address a phenomenon that has an international dimension and that affects every one of us. Fiorello Provera,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, before I come to the report, I would like to respond to Mr Meyer and Mr Tavares. I really respect the opinions of everyone, but it seems to me that their views on Lampedusa and what is happening in Lampedusa are hardly generous. I wanted to inform them that 12 000 people arrived in Lampedusa within the space of three nights. Lampedusa is a small island with 6 000 inhabitants and 12 000 people arrived suddenly in three nights, increasing the population to 20 000. I think it is very difficult for any country to accept such a large number of people arriving in such a short space of time on a small island which has no facilities for such a great number of arrivals. There are currently 1 400 migrants on Lampedusa. Much has been done, and as soon as sea conditions permitted, the migrants were transferred to other centres, primarily in the south of the country. This brings us to the report. I wanted to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the different political parties who, with their different sensibilities, have contributed very effectively to this report. They made a fundamental contribution, in absolute transparency, in the same spirit that inspired us all at the beginning. I also thank Commissioner Malmström for the enthusiasm she has shown for the concept of burden sharing, which should influence her work within the Commission and thus within Council. If she continues to show the same enthusiasm, I think the results will follow. I end by saying that the situation is very difficult to sum up. Insofar as a summing up is possible, I would like to say that any policy will be ineffective and incomplete as long as huge differences persist between the levels of development in the North and South of the world, as long as huge differences persist in the quality of democratic institutions, and as long as there are vast differences in respect for human rights. We must take action as part of a major policy of strategic cooperation and aid that will have an impact on the structural causes that led to these huge inequalities between North and South. If we solve those structural causes, the rest will follow and the world we all live in will probably be a better place. Fiorello Provera,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I also wish to express my sympathy and admiration for the dignity, fortitude and cohesion demonstrated by the Japanese people in the face of the sort of catastrophe that the world has rarely seen in terms of size and severity. The behaviour of the Japanese people is truly an inspiration to all and they deserve our help. The lesson to be learned from this experience is the need to strengthen the European civil protection system through more closely coordinated action and the wider availability of people and resources so that we can act quickly in the event of disaster. With regard to the nuclear option, it would be a mistake to discuss this topic on the emotional tide of current events: the subject is too important and must be addressed with a scientific approach. It is absolutely right to strengthen security measures for present and next-generation power stations and to dismantle those that are older and more unsafe, but we must avoid political exploitation and be cautious and pragmatic, as Mr Brok said. We should remember that in the same Fukushima area, a dam collapsed during the earthquake with many casualties, but this does not lead us to think of dismantling dams or building new ones, hence I call for caution, attention and openness to the future.

 Through this report, Parliament has highlighted important issues that deserve to be emphasised in terms of the growth of European industry. I am referring to the recognition of the strategic role of small and medium-sized enterprises and to the need to make it easier to access credit with simplified funding procedures, as well as the importance of internationalisation as a key factor for competitiveness.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Belder on his excellent work. Whilst the world is watching the revolt in the Arab world, Iran continues to repress dissidents. The arrest of the two leaders of the opposition, Mr Mousavi and Mr Karoubi, is the most obvious proof of this. The West took action against Mr Gaddafi, but it continues to dither over Iran, perhaps because Mr Gaddafi has already fallen whilst Mr Ahmadinejad so far has not. The largest rebellion since the post-electoral revolts of 2009 is currently under way in Iran. What are we waiting for before we freeze all the assets held by Mr Ahmadinejad, the companies controlled by the revolutionary guard and all supporters of the regime who are involved in this repression? What are we waiting for in order to impose travel restrictions on these figures of the regime? Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is the principal financial backer of the Palestinian Authority, providing it with around EUR 1 billion per year, and yet Europe’s political role in the peace process remains marginal. This large-scale financial assistance gives us the right to ask the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to return to the negotiating table. On the issue of the recognition of Palestine, we must be clear. The problem of peaceful coexistence with Israel will not be resolved through unilateral recognition of the Palestinian State, which, moreover, still has not been self-proclaimed. The PNA must instead go back to taking an active role, sit down at the negotiating table and resolve the ongoing disputes, particularly over safe borders, on the status of Jerusalem and on the issue of refugees. Even a partial agreement would strengthen the moderate sections of both sides and reduce the influence of extremism. Fiorello Provera,

Without democracy, economic development will serve only to enrich a few families, as has always been the way in countries that have no social justice. European policy must therefore support Egypt as it embarks on reforms and help the Egyptian people to choose their own future unaided. On the other hand, we must be clear with the future government of Cairo and emphasise that a new and more generous partnership policy will be conditional upon regional security and peace with Israel.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to provide an immediate political response to these emergencies. The urgent interventions requested by Italy are: 1) the transformation of Frontex from a coordination agency to an operative structure with its own people and resources; 2) the implementation of the principle of burden sharing; 3) the use of Europol for investigations on possible terrorist infiltrations and criminal organisation of the traffic in human beings; and 4) the allocation of resources to deal with the emergency. In any case, none of this will resolve the structural causes of the revolutions in the Maghreb, which all arise from the lack of genuine political parties, trade unions, associations, a free press and, above all, lack of respect for human rights. In essence, the institutional tools that characterise true democracy and give the people a voice are missing. Without them, there cannot be economic development, jobs, stability and security for all. This is the real political challenge that Europe must face up to. Fiorello Provera,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the old order is changing in the Maghreb and this crisis raises a multitude of problems that will not be easy to solve. There are risks as well as hopes. It is possible that secular authoritarian regimes could be replaced by aggressive, destabilising Islamic fundamentalist theocracies. We should remember what happened in Iran: it is hard for democratic development to go hand-in-hand with revolution. There are certainly lessons to be learnt from Iran. Another danger is that the economic crisis in the area is likely to worsen, resulting in even greater youth unemployment and large influxes of migrants that Europe can no longer cope with. These events are a sign that our Euro-Mediterranean policy is inadequate and show that the cooperation policy implemented so far is not up to the task of creating the conditions for development and democracy. What has happened is not due solely to the economic crisis, even though it has been severe, but to the lack of social stability, in other words the lack of vehicles to represent the people’s interests, such as trade unions, a free press, political pluralism, a voluntary sector, the rule of law and equal opportunities for everyone. Supporting the countries of this region in their journey should be at the heart of Europe’s policy, alongside economic and trade assistance. This is the way to create true stability: not the stability provided by authoritarian regimes, but stability founded on social consensus, participation and democratic institutions.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Cesare Battisti is not a romantic hero as some have depicted him, but a savage murderer with a history of robbery who has been found guilty of killing four people with shots to the back of the neck. He benefited unjustly from Mr Mitterrand’s doctrine of political asylum and has been protected and idealised by some left-wing French intellectuals. Having fled to Brazil to avoid repatriation and prison, Mr Battisti was saved by President Lula due to an erroneous decision that was probably made for political reasons, with no regard for the suffering of the victims and their relatives. Mrs Figueiredo, Parliament’s request to the Brazilian authorities and to the Commission does not only ask for the respect of legal rules and bilateral agreements, but also aims to affirm the principle that no ideological reason can justify the actions of a murderer and no country may guarantee him impunity. We must never forget that there is ethical value in the moral compensation of victims by serving a punishment. This is at the foundation of the social contract that props up all communities that are civilised, or that aim to be. Giancarlo Scottà,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must thank Ms García Pérez for her long and patient work over the last year to reach an agreement that is as close as possible to Parliament’s position. The course of events started back in 2009 with our own-initiative report on quality products, which highlighted certain important issues on which we have achieved results today and others on which we still have work to do. The outcome we have secured is a success for all those producers, associations and cooperatives that have supported us over these years, and acknowledges their commitment to quality. The importance of their work is highlighted in this report, since the Member States are enabled to promote the establishment and operation of such groups. The positive outcomes obtained are due to the teamwork shown by Parliament’s delegation to the meetings with the other institutions. They include ex officio
 protection, whereby the Member States must protect products with quality marks, even where they are used as ingredients in processed products, without waiting for producers to make a complaint. In contrast to the measures introduced in Mr Nicholson’s report on contractual relations in the milk and milk products sector, production management for quality marks in other sectors has been left out of the report now being debated. It was simply not possible to reach agreement on production planning, a crucial issue for our producers. They wanted this instrument above all to make it possible to balance demand and supply. We will continue working alongside our fellow Members to achieve this outcome as well. Lastly I would like to thank the Italian associations that represent the cooperatives, which have worked with us and will continue to do so. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a substitute member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and a full member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I have had the occasion to work on this dossier. I have the impression that, on this issue, the Commission is not taking the real protagonists of the event – the breeders and the producers – into consideration. The aim of the proposals is to introduce a ban on voluntary labelling – a measure that is precisely not obligatory – which allows producers who choose to do so to provide additional information on the label. Since the same organisations representing breeders and producers have asked for this measure to continue to be provided, it is paradoxical not to concede this possibility. On the contrary, within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, work is being carried out in order that our farmers can provide data relating to the products that they sell in as transparent a way as possible. It therefore seems counterproductive to work, on the one hand, to protect the provision of information to consumers and make it transparent while, on the other hand, abolishing measures, voluntary measures even, that go in the same direction. It is clear that these are choices to be made if the intention is to lower the quality and the standards of agricultural products. There is no other explanation of a comparable measure against breeders committed to providing indications of quality, such as the choice of one type of feed rather than another. For these reasons, I will be voting against certain amendments. Giancarlo Scottà,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard and as has been said, I am concerned about what is happening in Syria, where the conflict is continuing with increasing loss of human life. Neither of the two sides can win via the military approach and the only possible solution is a political one, supported by the government and the opposition. Europe must work to this end. The dangers to avoid are a takeover by Islamic extremism or the Balkanisation of the country along ethnic and religious lines. I hope that Europe adopts a serious and practical stance – which, as we have already heard, it is working on – and I therefore hope for an excellent outcome to put an end to these civilian and military deaths, and everything else.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we have adopted today proposes the creation of a single working and services area for the maritime, mountain and lake areas of the Mediterranean basin, with the participation of national governments and, above all, local and regional authorities. This project rekindles the political ideal of a Europe of the regions, in line with the founding fathers’ original vision for Europe. To highlight the importance of macro-regions, I would like to highlight and bring to your attention an initiative that came about, in part, as a result of the work and ideas of my party’s representatives. It is the agreement to create the macro-region of the Alps, signed in St Gallen, Switzerland, on 29 June by regions belonging to France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria and Germany. The leaders of the three northern Italian regions of Veneto, Lombardy and Piedmont took part in the meeting. I hope this initiative will soon come to fruition, not least in this Chamber, thereby helping Europe evolve towards a genuine Europe of the people and of the regions. That is the only way to overcome the current financial crisis, to add value to our regions and their special quality products, to revive the economy in real terms, and to fully implement the principle of subsidiarity. That is why I voted for Mr Alfonsi’s report. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with my colleague’s report on rural development where it introduces some appreciable elements of simplification such as the reduction in the number of annual progress and summary reports. Under the heading of rural development is the change to the rules on using advisory services, which should help to reduce the administrative burden for Member States. I also agree with Mr De Castro on the need not to exclude support for producer associations in the fruit and vegetable sector, as part of measures to support the establishment and administration of producer associations. I also consider it essential, as the rapporteur stated, that Member States which have opted for regional programmes be allowed calculation of the automatic decommitment of financial resources at Member State level. I also agree with the position of Mr Capoulas Santos in his report on the system of financing by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, and I thank the other Members that I have not mentioned for their work.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Ms Paulsen for her report. I find it very odd that in such a prestigious House, where important decisions will be taken, there are still those who, in an ambiguous, anachronistic spirit of animal welfare, waste precious time and cost all European citizens and taxpayers money, with no benefit to human welfare or health. Faced with a text that is potentially of great interest to animal lovers – I am one too – and that will naturally have positive consequences for animals themselves, people are seeking to table amendments that undermine all the premises of the text and the very meaning of our friends’ welfare, with abstract suggestions of no legal or ethical value. Therefore, I cannot help wondering whether we should be investing – maybe I should say ‘wasting’ – time and resources to deal with proposals devoid of any practical interest for Europeans. Consequently, I shall be voting for Ms Paulsen’s report. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the objectives of the programme for food distribution include reasonable prices, market stabilisation and support for deprived persons. The institutions and national authorities have confirmed the need for full support of the programme through the EU budget, rejecting proposals for cofinancing by the Member States. There has been discussion about food wastage. We recently approved the report by Mr Caronna, which included the problem of the meagre access of the poorest population groups to food. I think that the issues are closely linked: helping to reduce wastage also means helping the most deprived. There are many local initiatives to help people in financial difficulties. I would like to mention the example of food collections, which should play a more prominent part in the programme on which we have been asked to vote. People who wish to donate spontaneously but do not have channels to do so need to be organised and put online. I would like to take the opportunity to thank all those who work towards these goals in their everyday lives. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate my fellow Member on choosing the issues tackled. Why new skills? Changes in the labour market undoubtedly make it necessary to change and acquire new skills. However, what should we do with the skills that represent our heritage and our traditions? Ms Bastos highlights the need to maintain the craft tradition and its associated skills. However, we need to do more. What about the trades that were once pivotal to the economy in certain areas? These areas, for example, in the mountains and foothills, no longer exist, having been abandoned in favour of the cities. One solution which could help create jobs and therefore help with employment might be precisely to rehabilitate certain trades and traditions, which would also help disadvantaged areas. In order to ensure certain jobs continue, we need to invest in the young and give them a leading role in projects, traditions and trades that have fallen into disuse in the areas in question. Training aimed at finding young people jobs in small companies in these areas would have a two-fold benefit, helping to rehabilitate abandoned areas and increasing youth employment.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the key word in this report is ‘consumer’. We often forget who we are addressing when we take decisions. Important decisions have been taken in the report we are discussing, such as the indication of specific nutritional value or the indication of origin, in order to give consumers more correct information. It is a step forward, not the ultimate goal. Indication of origin for agricultural food products –
 the provenance of the main foodstuffs that make up a product –
 should be the first information available to the consumer. There are various cases in which traceability is vital, the latest being the bacteria which unfortunately killed several people. By identifying the provenance of a product it is possible to take swift action or to safeguard the product from incorrect information. The issue of competitiveness is no less important. Often an indication of origin can be a guarantee and a promise of quality. The various quality products of each country have won the trust of consumers. We support the indication of origin because consumers have the right to know what they are eating. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, of all Europe’s policies, the common agricultural policy is the one that has had to be updated the most over the years in order to cope with constant changes occurring on the economic front, including at international level. It has always been updated with two main goals in mind: guaranteeing an income for European farmers and dealing with an ever-decreasing EU budget, while not forgetting a whole host of other objectives linked to quality of production, of the environment, of biodiversity and of water resources. The CAP reform on which we will vote tomorrow is vital if we are to continue to support the income of our farmers, as my colleagues have already mentioned. The aim, then, is not to reduce direct subsidies but to find a balance between such subsidies and rural development, so that the system is rendered simpler and fairer, without the rules of competition being called into question. As regards the objectives of the CAP in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy, the CAP can contribute to the growth of a sustainable economy by responding well to new challenges and taking account of the diversity and richness of agriculture and the specific characteristics of the 27 Member States.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer my contribution by stating the need for a new methodological approach, particularly in the heritage and cultural heritage sector, linked to the intelligent use of new technology. An awareness of the massive potential for improvement that new technologies can offer us, both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, necessarily involves abandoning the ways we worked in the past. New technologies mean new working methods. I myself have witnessed that by using technology intelligently in the monument protection sector, it is possible to obtain significant results, in terms of both the planning and restoration works. Additionally, as a simultaneous by-product, and without incurring additional costs, we can obtain highly accurate geometrical databases that can be used to monitor and manage the artefact in the event of natural disasters, as well as products for scientific education and for promoting the artefact on a global scale, fulfilling criteria for cultural understanding and exchange What I think matters most is that we contribute to a plan of action, whose aim is to help us reach a new awareness of technology, so that new economic opportunities may be created for Europe. I believe especially in the need to train new people and in professional, young and highly qualified individuals, who are able to rise to the challenges posed by the new global market.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, novel foods are food products or ingredients that undergo production processes and involve a change in nutritional value. I have a number of doubts about the new Novel Food Regulation. What relation will it bear to the regulation on genetically modified organisms (GMOs), since cloning is an aspect of genetic engineering and, as with GMOs, it involves actual genetic manipulation? How will the movement of these foods between European countries be regulated? How will the scientific tests needed to test the safety of these novel foods be carried out? What will the criteria be for defining these products and, most of all, how will consumers be informed of the characteristics and nutritional properties of the novel foods they purchase? My central concerns are consumer protection, food safety in the use of these novel products, and correct information. I therefore believe there must be total traceability for consumers, especially for natural products, for which we already find it difficult to guarantee traceability. Giancarlo Scottà,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased with this initiative, which aims to transform the European Heritage Label into a formal action of the European Union in order to increase its effectiveness, visibility, prestige and credibility. To this end, I should like to emphasise the importance of the professionalism of the members of the panel of experts appointed to evaluate the sites, as well as the rigorousness of the procedures for attribution of the label and reviewing its maintenance as time goes on. These elements are essential to ensure the specificity and quality of the label itself. The label must, however, focus entirely on symbolic and educational value, rather than on the beauty of the site – as other initiatives for the promotion of cultural heritage tend to – so as to clearly differentiate it from these. Therefore, I also agree that transnational sites should be held in particular consideration, in virtue of their symbolic importance. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome Mrs Mănescu’s report. Multi-level governance has a key role to play in cohesion policy and, in this respect, the multi-level approach, which provides for cooperation and shared responsibilities across various levels of government, is being put into practice in the management of regional funds. The Commission is promoting initiatives in favour of regional and local authorities. There must be a greater incentive to support such proposals in order to ensure the real coordination and effective implementation of European programmes. The partnership must be guaranteed by a culture based on dialogue between the various parties involved. Cooperation at regional level must be transparent and must ensure fair representation of all concerned. For this reason, it is important to provide appropriate training for subnational representatives through initiatives such as Erasmus for regional and local officials, the financial cost of which must be borne by the Commission. This is likewise useful for exchanging good practices and for improving the quality and effectiveness of cohesion fund management. Giancarlo Scottà,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the third summit between the European Union and Africa is a fundamental opportunity to consolidate relations between the two parties. During this event we will talk about economic growth, sustainable development and political governance, considering several dossiers, including an examination of the agriculture and food safety sector in the context of the Millennium Development Goals. In order to guarantee universal access to food, combat poverty in rural areas and improve the quality of agricultural production, the participation of producers’ organisations and sector associations is required so that they can be committed and aware, and improve the distribution and management of natural resources. The European Union must work to make the best of these opportunities to intensify dialogue and cooperation in support of regional integration in Africa. In particular, the imbalances and corruption of cooperation initiatives must be fought. Governments’ responsibilities must not predominate over those of civil society and the participation of all those involved in strategies of sustainable economic and social growth must be guaranteed.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, cereal price volatility is having severe repercussions on all livestock sectors but also on consumers. Cereal exporting is blocked due to the effect of the heat, fires, drought and floods – as is happening now in Italy. To aggravate the situation, Canada has reduced production following heavy rainfall this summer. Prices have been influenced not only by climate change but also by speculation on international markets. Cereal producers who are awaiting a price increase wait before selling their produce and put it in store, with the result that these agricultural products deteriorate. Speculation and severe climate change have led to a great increase in the prices of cereals used as animal feed and a knock-on increase in meat prices. I believe it is essential for the Commission to ensure timely, targeted action to deal with the volatility in agricultural-product prices through innovative market interventions under the new CAP. The Commission must prevent speculative practices in agriculture to preserve the businesses of farmers and stock breeders and guarantee consumers genuine quality products at fair prices.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to a sector in which conditions for the female workforce continue to be precarious. I refer to the agricultural sector, a sector in which women focus on innovation and, at the same time, on revitalising traditions and preserving agricultural heritage, keeping rural territory alive. Yet female workers encounter a range of obstacles in their working activities, having to reconcile their working life with family life. Mrs Thomsen, in her report, provides a figure which gives us food for thought: in the agricultural sector, 86% of female workers are employed part-time. Furthermore, the entry of young women into this sector is fraught with difficulty and for this reason, women managing the farms are often over 65. On the other hand, some other women assume the position of supporting partner, or rather, they help with their husband’s farm, without being entitled to a legal status and without being appropriately remunerated. I would argue, therefore, that it is necessary to protect women and their employment in a sector in which their work is often temporary and seasonal, support them in the area of health and safety, and ensure they receive fair pay and appropriate recognition for their work.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, future regional and cohesion policy must be aligned with the Europe 2020 strategy priorities, and therefore it must be focused on the objectives of sustainable growth, social inclusion and employment. It needs to support the effective development of the European regions by levelling out the differences between them and enhancing the specific characteristics of the more marginalised areas which are still facing regional development challenges. The projects must take into account the less developed regions, which have been most severely affected by the crisis. New challenges such as population density in certain areas and depopulation in others, in mountain areas, in particular, along with climate change, must be addressed through concrete actions that strengthen local and regional involvement. The multi-level approach must stimulate the integrated development of disadvantaged areas by involving local and regional authorities as well as civil society. I urge the Commission to take into account the specific characteristics of each region, namely the regional dimensions of the various levels of development, and to simplify the management and control procedures for financed projects in order to ensure their effective and prompt execution.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon devotes particular attention to regions with severe and permanent handicaps. This is why I support Mr Provera’s initiative concerning the agricultural, environmental and cultural rehabilitation of these regions. I therefore call for the Commission to set to work as soon as possible on implementing a policy for mountain regions that will tackle the difficulties, declining population and abandonment of mountain regions, with the environmental degradation that that entails. It is crucial to provide for the agricultural activity, quality of life and cultural heritage of those living in disadvantaged conditions, and it is fundamental to ensure that the actions undertaken by the Commission, the Member States and regional and local authorities are in harmony with one another. A fundamental principle of the European Union is subsidiarity, an instrument that is crucial to promoting the development of disadvantaged regions through lasting and well-targeted measures resulting from regional proposals. This is a significant challenge, and the task will be to keep people in these regions, or, better still, to encourage them back there. Giancarlo Scottà,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is both important and necessary to achieve a balance between the need to advance scientific research and the need to protect animal welfare. Protection for animals used in scientific procedures is currently inadequate. New scientific knowledge means that alternatives can be promoted to replace or reduce the use of animals. Methods or procedures must be used that cause as little pain and suffering as possible, but without impeding scientific research designed to fight diseases. It is therefore right to review Europe’s animal protection legislation in order to achieve satisfactory results that both meet the demands of the research industry, given the need to pursue scientific research that benefits human health, and, at the same time, look after the welfare of those animals still needed for scientific purposes.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lyon, ladies and gentlemen, in a context such as this, farms need strong support in order to innovate and make progress. The role of farmers needs to undergo a radical change: by systemising agricultural production farmers become agricultural entrepreneurs, and thus promote economic development. I believe it is fundamentally important for the recovery of countless abandoned areas of land to be used in the creation of short, closed agricultural branches – in other words, systems that link agricultural cultivation directly to sales. These systems can operate and become widespread throughout the European Union. I believe that, under the new common agricultural policy (CAP), the Commission should support the creation of agricultural cooperatives so as to cut production costs and make farmers more competitive. The Commission must commit itself to defining a budget that is sufficient to achieve these objectives. The funding for the new CAP must be linked to results, so as to prevent waste and various kinds of speculation. What is more, at this time of crisis, many young people want to return to farming. However, they are faced with various obstacles: land is too expensive, and rural development policies are difficult to manage; the fact that there are long waiting times for land and that it is granted on the basis of earnings rather than on the basis of the ideas expressed by young entrepreneurs prevents this group from realising its potential. I believe that the Commission must take a supportive and flexible approach to helping young farmers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Spanish Presidency has decided to sign this agreement. This decision has caused some concern, as we have already heard, and in tabling this question my fellow Members are asking for clarification as regards the impact that the negotiations may have on European producers and products. I wished to point out that the creation of a free-trade relationship between the two parties allows for imports into Europe of animal products containing antibiotic growth activators that have not undergone sufficient testing, and of genetically modified agricultural products that could jeopardise farmers’ food safety. I therefore call on the Commission to adopt an authoritative position so as to safeguard European quality production. The Commission must also undertake to ensure that Europe’s high production standards are recognised at international level and that these same standards are required of all imported products. Lastly, I believe that the Commission should take account of the concerns expressed by the various associations in the sector, so as to ensure transparent and fair negotiations that do not harm the European economy.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are being asked to vote on a draft report on information to consumers, but have we really asked ourselves what consumers want? Have these considerations been agreed on behind closed doors in Parliament, or do they reflect the interests of consumers? The latest survey announced by the Commission may not be representative of the increased awareness that consumers have developed in recent years with regard to information about their food choices. It is not only the origin but also the ingredients and other characteristics that are becoming a fundamental part of the decision-making process. Are we aware that the decisions we make today will influence tomorrow’s purchases? Should it not be consumers who determine the market? Why not try to understand, through a new survey or by maintaining ongoing direct dialogue with consumers, what it is that they really want? We must represent consumers as best we can. That is why we are here and, from the meetings I have had, I have discovered that consumers want to be involved more. They do not expect the buying process to be complicated by the inclusion of pointless information on labels, but nor do they expect overly simplistic, misleading choices such as the traffic light system, which risk providing irrelevant information that is not necessary for an informed choice and does not meet their needs. Our approach must not be paternalistic but open to dialogue. Giancarlo Scottà,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with market globalisation and the severe crisis now affecting Europe, including in the agricultural sector, one possible response on the part of the agricultural market is to place emphasis on product quality. I believe that a good EU quality policy can enhance competitiveness and create added value for Europe’s regional economies, since, for many rural areas where production alternatives are few, it is often the one and only opportunity for development. By supporting niche agriculture in these disadvantaged areas, we will create an economy and jobs there. Furthermore, a future quality policy must also be linked to the major potentialities of agriculture which, as in the European case, is modern, dynamic, rich and diversified and can offer not only high quality food products but also services of great value to a constantly evolving society. In my report, I emphasised the importance of keeping the three systems for registration of geographical indications separate, since they represent the link with European regions, representing their traditions, history, taste and unique knowledge handed down over time. I therefore believe that, by keeping the two PDO and PGI systems separate, they take account of the specific differences in the nature and strength of the links between the products and their geographical area of production. Consumers often confuse the geographical indication of where a food product was processed with the place of origin of the agricultural product as such, and are often not aware of how the food chain operates. I therefore consider that only the compulsory indication of the place of production of the primary products can provide consumers with full information on the quality of the products they are buying, since products are subject to a production cycle which exerts considerable influence on their characteristics in terms of quality and food safety. Let us remember that it is our duty to protect what our fellow citizens, who voted for us, produce and eat. Another two issues that I considered important to include in my report are as follows: the importance of an intensive campaign of consumer education and information, which the European Union should undertake concerning the various European labels and the guarantees they represent, and the inclusion in international registries and international recognition through the WTO system of geographical indications. This last point is vitally important if we want to protect against the counterfeiting of our high quality products. I would like to thank Commissioner Cioloş for his attendance and remind him of the importance of sufficiently protecting quality systems, which are our future, and remind him too that the economy of disadvantaged rural areas can be boosted by agricultural sector aid, to safeguard all those niche products that are typical of these areas and that keep the people connected to the locality, which would otherwise be abandoned. This would support respect for the environment and for the landscape and would create, where possible, a tourist and oenogastronomy economy linked to the various regional, cultural and historical differences in the European Union. I would like to thank my colleagues for the support they gave me in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and I hope that the European Parliament will also give its support during the vote tomorrow.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, Commissioner Cioloş. I should like to begin by talking very briefly about the land. The land is that from which we harvest our products and which we must preserve for the future and for those who will have to do the same. That is why, taking this simple thought as a starting point, I should like to move on to producers, to those who work the land, who must be recognised also by those who subsequently enjoy the commercial produce they find in the supermarket or some other shop. It is therefore only right that we respect first the land, which yields the produce, then the processor, if any, but above all the consumer. I should like to make a proposal for the benefit of consumers, and I am not sure whether it will be welcomed or not: why not ask consumers what they want to know? In this way, we will know which potential label consumers are able to read and to understand, and thus perhaps make it much simpler than the complicated labels we have today. Why must consumers not know that they have the choice of drinking a litre of milk from Europe or a litre of milk from Brazil? It will be for them to choose whether a litre of Brazilian milk is better than a litre of milk produced in the European Union. Be that as it may, I consider and I hope that this report will be useful for Commissioner Cioloş by providing further details to help grow that thread I referred to earlier: the land, the producer, the processor, if any, the consumer, safety and, above all on the issue of safety, quality. We have all spoken about quality, and I believe that we are all in favour of raising the quality of our produce even more if it means eating well and eating healthily. Giancarlo Scotta',

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to stress my doubts about the proposal to extend the 2009-2010 intervention period for butter and skimmed milk powder, since this proposal is in danger of turning short-term measures designed for the current crisis in the market into structural measures that would actually restore the dairy farming sector to the position it was in before quotas were introduced. In an effort to make the market measures more balanced, where benefits are not given solely to those Member States involved in butter and skimmed milk powder production, I call for the reintroduction of Community aid for private storage of cheese with a long maturation period. Lastly, I would like to draw your attention to the matter of the origin marking and labelling of dairy products and to the traceability of products: this is a request that comes directly from European consumers – in ever greater numbers – and one that might help us to tackle the crisis in the dairy farming sector. I hope that my fellow Members from the other groups, too, can endorse this proposal. Oreste Rossi  (EFD

 The European Commission must decide once and for all whether it wants to have a Solidarity Fund that responds to serious natural disasters and shows solidarity with those affected rapidly and promptly or whether it wants to indulge in some form of worthless public image exercise. We are dealing here with measures for European civil protection that require prompt provision of assistance to those in difficulty and the European Commission is not capable of releasing the financial assistance to help the earthquake victims of Emilia-Romagna. The proposal to obtain funds through redeployment, from sources that currently amount to EUR 13 million is ridiculous and the Commission should be ashamed of it. I also wish to underline that the European Commission is currently deciding whether to demand that enterprises return the assistance they received for flooding in 1994 and paid out to them by the Italian government, without realising that this would mean certain bankruptcy. I think that the Commission should seriously rethink its position, because it seems to have no knowledge whatsoever of the problems that are being discussed here today, or what it means to be affected by natural disasters.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution is based on a perfectly acceptable principle, which I myself have expressed more than once, underlining both the threat posed by climate change and the fact that it needs to be dealt with at an international level, but by all parties. It is wrong, however, to ask the European Union to take steps unilaterally to cut emissions by 50 % over the levels of the 1990s by 2050. It should be evident that if we continue to depress European industry, we encourage relocation of large enterprises to third countries. Unlike the members of the committee, I consider the Durban Package to be insufficient because no binding global agreement was reached on reduction of emissions. It is sheer madness to think of embarking on the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol unilaterally, in the absence of the United States, the Russian Federation, Japan and Canada, with uncertainty regarding Australia and New Zealand, and knowing that the great polluters such as China, India, Brazil and Indonesia continue to lack emissions reduction targets.

 I support the text of the report on the ‘Offshore Protocol’ because I believe there is a need for increased safety of offshore oil and gas exploitation activities, especially following the dramatic accident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Offshore activities in the Mediterranean are likely to increase due to the discovery of new reserves of fossil fuel, and an accident of such kind could have immediate large-scale effects on a semi-closed sea such as the Mediterranean, causing tragic consequences for its economy and its fragile ecosystems, and undermining the efforts made by EU Mediterranean coastal Member States to achieve and maintain good environmental status in their marine waters as required by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. In view of the importance of this Protocol on exploration and exploitation in the Mediterranean, the removal of harmful waste and the removal of disused installations, I hope that it will be complied with and implemented with provisions on safety and monitoring.

 I am in favour of the text under examination, which seeks the implementation of promotion measures and information provision for agricultural products. I believe that, for consumers to eat properly, they should be properly informed, with the product origin shown on the label. That is the only way of guaranteeing food safety. This policy aims to promote local markets, developing the concept of low food miles and at the same time enhancing market potential in the EU. I also support the promotion of information campaigns on quality wines, aimed at responsible consumption and – this should not be underestimated – the need to educate children on the importance of a healthy, balanced diet based on fruit, vegetables, etc. provided that these are of good quality. The quality policy for agricultural products should therefore on the one hand provide farmers with the tools to identify products with special characteristics and promote them more effectively and on the other protect them from unfair practices.

Mr President, personally, I have not been contacted by any lobby groups in favour of shale gas, despite the fact that I sit on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and am convinced that this is a resource we should be exploiting with the requisite care. What I want to know is why you did not make the same accusation when lots of us received thousands of abusive emails, simply for voting in favour of animal experimentation for scientific purposes.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what concerns me is that I do not think we are the ones being irresponsible by being in favour of the extraction of something that could make Europe self-sufficient in terms of fossil fuels; it is the Greens criticising this stance who are irresponsible because they are fine about keeping themselves warm – obviously I do not think they stay cold – with the same or similar products imported from third countries where mining and drilling is done at the risk of causing earthquakes. You see, if you take oil or gas out from under the ground you create the same voids that are formed by extracting shale gas. So this is fine for other countries but it should not happen in Europe. We have to spend taxpayers’ money paying for stuff from third countries when we could – this is only a possibility – we could be self-sufficient with stuff we produce in Europe. At this point something does not make sense to me and I start to wonder whether the Greens have some other hidden agenda. I will close by saying that I really think caring for the environment is important, but I do not think we should miss this opportunity to extract something that could make Europe economically self-sufficient from the point of view of oil and gas extraction.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Ms Sartori because, with this initiative, we are finally able to discuss a problem that has affected hundreds of thousands of workers who, due to rash decisions that force the European Union to tackle climate change unilaterally and excessively, face losing their jobs. Steelworks, as major energy consumers, are even more crippled by the European Commission’s decision to withdraw some of the ETS quotas already distributed and its determination to set a minimum price for future auctions. This decision by the European Commission, which I criticised during a debate within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, will mainly affect the steelworks themselves, which already lost 10 % of their market share in 2011 and in 2012 stand to lose a further 12 %. The only solution to avoid unfair competition from third countries is to impose import tariffs, in proportion to the difference in the cost of steel production in Europe and in the third country.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am in favour of the text of Ms Costa’s report on protecting children in the digital world, given that the percentage of young people online is constantly growing. I think that it is imperative to protect minors from websites with harmful content with strong elements of violence, racism and discrimination. Moreover, we must not underestimate the presence of child pornography websites, which can put at risk the lives of the very youngest, and of people who try to lure minors. It is for schools to train minors in the practical and critical use of the digital technology associated with the internet. Training allows young people to master digital skills, which have been recognised as among the eight key competences required for those living in a knowledge-based society. With schools, society shares this responsibility, aware as it is of the social and economic advantages of critical, active and safe use of digital media by minors, as opposed to use leading to dependence … (The President cut off the speaker) Oreste Rossi  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this presentation proposes objectives that we all support, such as combating unemployment, reintegrating the unemployed, relaunching small and medium-sized enterprises, guaranteeing the security of pension schemes – but it does not propose any measures for meeting these challenges. For example, it does not go into any depth in considering which resources the Member States should use to deal with the crisis, nor does it criticise the scandalous choice made by the European Commission in financing the banks without using the funds awarded to bring about economic upturn, thus allowing the credit institutions not to help businesses and families but to acquire government securities, ensuring a guaranteed profit for themselves at almost no risk. Accordingly, the decision was taken, in a period of crisis like this, to finance the banks rather than to encourage an improvement in the economic structure. It would have been an excellent proposal to call on the Commission to propose removing the prohibition on direct aid to the States by the European Central Bank. I shall abstain, since the report amounts to a simple declaration of intent, on points that we all support, but which is devoid of content or concrete proposals.Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rosy picture painted by President Barroso contrasts with a reality that is plain to see: millions of workers protesting for job and wage security so as to be able to support their families and hundreds of thousands of small enterprises in difficulty. In Italy there has been a wave of suicides by small business owners, suffering side-by-side with their employees, because your friend Mr Monti only wants to help the banks and could not care less if the whole system of small and medium-sized enterprises, which has been so much a part of our country socially and industrially, disappears. I would also like underline one case that could be seen as emblematic of a Europe that is standing by and watching the death of its industrial, productive and above all manufacturing capacity. Anomalies in European funding have been discussed, but there is one instance of funding that stands out from all the rest. You have awarded the brother of Totò Riina EU funding. The brother, in other words, of the boss of bosses of the Italian mafia. And you granted funding to another boss while he was still in prison. Well that is a disgrace! It is a disgrace that this European super-bureaucracy did not even notice that it was financing somebody with the surname ‘Riina’. Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's discussion, which doubtless reprises other previous discussions, gives us a fairly limited picture of the problem, in my humble opinion. We cannot tackle the social problem and the social aspects and implications of this large-scale restructuring, which do not just affect the companies mentioned by the Commissioner. In Italy, for example, Fiat’s chief executive is misleading the public, and more importantly Fiat’s employees, by saying, ‘Don’t worry, our new products will be sold on the US market’, when everyone knows very well that the US market has no need for more imports; it is quite capable of meeting its future production requirements, even though it seems to have its own problems which are very different from Europe’s. In Europe there is no industrial policy for the automotive sector: we have a European Union which is dilly-dallying and has failed to come up with a sound plan, in view of social and other developments. The market has completely changed, and Europe needs to wake up. It needs to do something, because we need to maintain and conserve the level of quality and the technological and development capacity of manufacturing, especially in a key sector such as the European automotive industry.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Erasmus programme should be defended tooth and claw for the rights and future of our young people. It would be much better to cut the super-high pay and pensions of our senior officials, those untouchables of the European Union, or to reduce the gifts to high finance and the banking system. Some practical suggestions have been made by young people involved in Erasmus. During the Erasmus Day Live initiative, some suggestions were made to President Barroso such as exchanging homes, which could make it easier and less expensive for families, or introducing some working hours (young people want to work, and they could do so in libraries and archives, or in cultural institutions), and regionalisation. Some regions like my own, Piedmont, have suggested intervening along the lines of the principle of subsidiarity. Let us expand the basis for participation in Erasmus, let us give young people the role of offering suggestions and taking action. Erasmus is important. We critics of Europe are more supportive of Erasmus than some pro-Europeans, who want to cut not high-level bureaucracy, not costs or waste – good heavens, no! – but the things that serve the future of young people in Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not find this banking union convincing, because it seems to have no purpose other than to place a fine gravestone over any prospect of adopting the legal principles of the Glass-Steagall Act in Europe. In that respect, how can we not share the concern expressed by Georg Fahrenschon, the president of the German savings banks association, for whom a banking union with centralised supervision in the hands of the European Central Bank (ECB) and a common deposit guarantee fund is like a life assurance policy for ‘systemic’ banks, in other words those banks – not all of them – whose bellies are full of derivative rubbish? We are all well aware of that, but nobody dares say it! This solution will ensure that healthy banks, such as savings banks (not only the German ones but also the ones in Padania) and cooperative banks, which are close to the land, the people and the regions – you may recall the message given out yesterday by 2 million Catalans who want their freedom – will foot the bill so that the sick ones can continue to speculate. I would like to ask a final question: every day, Mario Draghi, the President of the ECB, says that the euro is irreversible. I would like to know if any of you have found an article in the Treaties that allows him to decide which currency the Member States should adopt. I have not found one. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, ladies and gentlemen, if we are about to hold the euro area’s funeral, we must admit that you, just like our Prime Minister, Mr Monti, have exactly the right look and physique for the part. This agreement sounds strange. We wanted to send a reassuring message, but this debate shows that it is built on shaky foundations, perhaps on nothing. For Italy, unless the European Stability Mechanism’s role as a panacea is fully supported by the ECB – something that remains to be seen – Mr Monti’s victory will be exactly like Italy’s football win against Germany: a Pyrrhic victory. Perhaps we can be saved from this danger of a future debacle by Our Lady of Fátima, but certainly not by your indecision, uncertainty or by pulling the wool over our eyes. Is what came out of the corridors of your summit true or not? Namely, the fear of Heads of State or Government that there will be a massive collapse in the banking sector which holds billions of derivatives thanks to your inattention, to tax havens, to everything that you allowed to happen. Why then, are you not straight with us about the heart of this problem: not state securities, but the great banking and financial collapse of the derivatives market, of financial speculation, given free rein by a certain world of finance that rules in Europe, and unfortunately also in my country now? Shame on you! Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that the debate is being held within the wrong frame of reference. The debate is not about having more Europe or less Europe. Current events force us to think about a completely different Europe: participatory, united, regional. A century ago, a certain Luigi Sturzo, exiled in England and writing in the English newspapers, was more modern in his thinking than this House, which refuses to consider Europe’s problems from the point of view of territories and regions, which is to say the productive, hard-working world which is the reality for our people. Today, I would like to represent the people of the industrial triangle of agricultural production of Mantua, Ferrara and Modena, where a major seismic event has caused serious problems for one of the most important productive centres in Europe. However, aside from a few visits by Mr Tajani and Mr Barroso, which I concede are important and which I must acknowledge, there has been no debate on practical issues. There is no central intervention on the ground that responds to the expectations of these communities. This Europe thinks in a Brussels way, like our centralist states! Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when this declaration was written, perhaps no one envisaged that, when the time came to debate it, the spread would have been consistently over 500 and, God forbid, even at 600 for Spain and, God forbid indeed, for Italy too. So, we want to combat speculation. This morning, President Barroso extolled to us the virtues of his solution of creating a European banking union. This, however, actually amounts to a way for the European Union to get its hands on our savings. Banking union will not protect European savers. National governments will lose any powers that they have or want to have over their respective national banking systems, whose contents will be poured into an undifferentiated melting pot of debt. In essence, banking union is an attempt, and quite a blatant one at that, to ward off insolvency in the Spanish banking system today by using the savings of the other euro area Member States, even poor Italy, harshly enough. It seems, then, to be a preventive strike against the growing support for the real reform that could solve the problem of this bankrupt system: in other words, banking separation or the Glass-Steagall Act. Essentially, this means separating savings banks from investment banks, which is the only way to prevent savings from being used to plug gaps or being lost when the speculators fail. We are witnessing the umpteenth attempt to contain a crisis by isolating it, as if the crisis were not affecting the entire euro area. This attempt must be stopped before it is too late.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the previous government was right to put a stop to the constant migration flows in circumstances that certainly did not allow a reception worthy of the name. One reason is that the centres – and the report is very vague on this issue – are regularly destroyed by their delightful occupants, whether they are illegal or irregular migrants, and of course Europe, the muggins in this whole affair, pays for this destruction with its taxes. It is true that the European Union has provided significant aid, but part of this has been, has had to be used to rebuild what the kind third-country nationals have destroyed, at the cost of European taxpayers. And we should have the courage to set this down on paper! Just as with regard to human rights, when these missions take place, we should also be concerned about making sure that the rights of workers are respected, as I have always done when I have been involved. Police forces and staff have to be protected, given that there have been cases of murder. Therefore, the government has done the right thing in regulating this emergency and these flows efficiently and energetically, in an attempt to help protect Europe’s external borders.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that in its laudable desire to help develop, aid and, I would suggest, influence the meaning and direction of the Arab revolutions in the sense of opening up towards democracy and economic development based, obviously, on a productive economy, the Commission has failed to meet its objective by linking all of this to the possibility of exporting agricultural products, etc. Undoubtedly, some pertinent comments have been made on this subject, because if we deprive these countries of their agricultural products, we impoverish them. In addition, why do we not start thinking seriously about the role of our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in order to introduce them there as a real work-training tool, which your bureaucrats cannot do as it can only really be done by those who know how SMEs are created, and that is by our small and medium-sized enterprise owners. Let us therefore encourage them to cooperate. Cooperation and economic recovery can only take place from the bottom up, with serious, concrete actions, not statements of principle and philosophical comments, which achieve nothing.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before making my case I feel that I must tip my hat to Mr López Aguilar, the Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for the very balanced way he conducted the debate and for his most dignified and sober words, which I do not think anyone has dared to refute with any sincerity or good reason. This morning, rather than getting into a series of philosophical or jurisprudential debates, we ought to take a responsible look at our fellow citizens’ right to safety. In particular we need to be thinking about those people such as workers and young people who have been victims of terrorist attacks on trains, perhaps, carrying workers, young people, and so on. We need to think about the right to safety, which must prevail over our personal and political considerations and those of a Eurosceptic group which I do not think will be able to vote in favour, as Mr Batten said. The Lega Nord
 Members of the House, meanwhile, will definitely vote in favour of this measure, not because we are not receptive to the serious and well-founded concerns over privacy, but because we think that right now there is a risk of widespread and possibly nuclear terrorism hanging over the world.

Your ‘non-solutions’ are taking the ship of the European economy and finance straight towards the iceberg of large-scale international speculation, and you do not seem to be aware of it. Let us consider these ‘non-solutions’ – the ‘bail-out fund’, a body not controlled by the EU institutions, but by stakeholders of the international financial lenders, and then this gigantic – the Chair of the European Central Bank (ECB) is not here – but we need to be brave enough to say that there is a gigantic conflict of interest between taxpayers, the European citizens that we represent, and the bosses of the ECB, that is, the gentlemen from the big central banks, which, in turn, are owned by private banks and by private finance.

 Madam President, I will use my explanation of vote – having voted for this report – to draw the attention of the House, or at least what remains of the House, to a very important statement, the statement by the Nobel prize-winning economist, Joseph Stiglitz, who – we read in the periodical of the University of Columbia, where he lectures in economics – has revealed that the decisions of the European Central Bank (ECB) are made according to instructions from a little-known organisation called the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. These statements are, at the very least, worrying. Does the European Union intend to find out whether these significant and weighty statements are true? Because of all the things we find out about derivatives, one thing is certain, and that is that there is an organisation and a mysterious trafficking that allows the system of major international speculation to decide on the policies which then affect actual people, working men and women who are responsible for producing in Member States, and this does not correspond to our vision of a Europe which needs to be a Europe of people and regions, not of bankers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have this morning heard many criticisms of the French President’s electoral posturing on immigration and on Schengen. This criticism has been developed from the point of view and through the lens of populism. Fair enough. I would like to apply the same analysis to the news in all the major European dailies yesterday and today. I am referring to the important stance taken by the greatest progressive European philosopher, the elderly but very clear-sighted Mr Habermas, who has looked at the reform, the fiscal compact, from a very specific point of view. He says that this reform, this pact, should not be approved because it is like wanting to increase, or rather, fooling ourselves that we want to increase, integration among Member States without civic integration among citizens. He says that it highlights the fact that only a democratic Europe, only popular will – even expressed through a referendum I would say, but that is my opinion – could produce politically credible decisions. He calls the European Union arrogant in its dealings with citizens and dominated by speculators. I had grown used to quoting Junger, but from now on, I will quote Habermas when criticising, from a populist and democratic point of view, your bad decisions which impact on the people. Maybe they are taken by the inner circle – the inner circle of the Bilderberg or Trilateral meetings – but they are obviously not taken here. Such decisions are then imposed on the people, without caring one jot about the real economy of those who work and sweat, workers and entrepreneurs. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have heard much harsh criticism of the Dutch Government’s guidelines with regard to family reunification. These criticisms of a country, which, in the full exercise of its sovereignty, is adopting more restrictive rules on such a delicate issue, one so closely related to the fundamental issue of immigrant integration, call to mind an official government document, which will be presented today, of all days, in Rome. This is the eighth report on immigration published by the Italian National Council of Economy and Labour (CNEL) – an Italian constitutional body – showing that the Italian regions and provinces in which integration has been most fully and seriously implemented are those in the north, and particularly in the north-east: that is, precisely those regions – such as the Veneto – governed by the Northern League, a movement which many in this Chamber regard as xenophobic. This leads me to believe that it is precisely the adoption of strict rules, of a substantial immigration filter, that can lead to true integration. Moreover, this is what emerges not from a biased opinion, but from an official government document, with constitutional status in my country. Let us therefore examine these proposed rules. Are they rules fit for the Third Reich or are they reasonable norms? When an immigrant, in order to obtain family reunification, is required to demonstrate that he has a job, a certain economic stability, etc.; when strict measures are called for with regard to the shameful scam of forced marriages or marriages of convenience, all we are asking for is European standards. In short, what we want are standards compatible with European judicial culture. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an excellent and balanced report which also rightly refers to the principle of subsidiarity, and therefore recognises the important and pre-eminent role played by Member States. The report, however, also paints a picture of a multi-speed Europe. As far as my country is concerned, there are two speeds. On the one hand, there are certain cities and regions – for example, Naples and Campania – that are a source of shame for those of us who, for the moment, have identity cards issued by the Italian State, a great source of shame that we continue to denounce. On the other hand, there are the virtuous towns of Padania where we have hundreds of mayors, for example, those of the Northern League, who may be ‘barbarian dreamers’, but who are also civilised people who teach citizens and ensure that they sort their rubbish and who organise the collection and incineration of waste. This civilised part of our country is an example for Europe. So let us move forward in this direction. I welcome the petitions which also inform the European authorities of these situations which, as I have said before, in Campania also pose a threat to European tourists who risk setting foot in those areas.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Ms Alfano can look at the European Parliament website where, modestly speaking, I am described as President of the provisional government of Padania. This is an official document of the European Parliament. Also, when she leaves her mafia homeland to come up north, she can see road signs saying ‘Higher Padania’ or ‘Lower Padania’.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, complying with the rules certainly does not mean abdicating one’s sovereignty. Furthermore I do not believe that the rules referred to and described justify effectively being put in the dock, because this is the earnest desire of many groups that remained silent when democratic demonstrations were repressed elsewhere, in Belgium for example, and three parliamentarians were put in prison because they wanted to commemorate September 11th. Mr Orbán, today all the patriots among us feel Hungarian, feel proud to be Hungarian, and we envy your people for experiencing a new-found freedom after conquering it in the way that it did. Come and visit us in Padania, where you will receive a hero’s welcome, because we welcome those who defend their sovereignty. You will be welcomed as a Prime Minister who, unlike others such as our own Prime Minister, is not a servant to powerful lobbies, and perhaps this is why you do not have the favour of international finance, given that it seems to want to tie the financial hands of a free Hungary, denying it the support that is provided without question to every other country in difficulty. I believe it is time to say that perhaps our peoples should be the ones to open infringement proceedings against those who, without a popular vote, have devolved their sovereignty to others, have abandoned their sovereignty, starting with monetary sovereignty, and I invite you to defend your country's monetary sovereignty. Those of us who have abandoned it anti-democratically and without consultation find ourselves in this fine financial situation. Courage, Mr Orbán, carry on along this route.

 Mr President, I am really afraid that the meagre, disappointing results of the Brussels summit mark an historic moment: the end of the historical inevitability of European unity. That should be a cause for concern, particularly to those who have always shown themselves to be enthusiastic about Europe. The summit was, in fact, a pointless farce that has not calmed speculation, let alone stopped it. One fact certainly makes us realise that investors are afraid of a euro default soon. The European Banking Authority revealed it when it announced that some 40 banks in the European Economic Area have sold EUR 170 billion of credit default swaps (CDS) on Greek, Irish, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish bonds. The soaring CDS market is a sure sign that the markets are afraid of a default, that there is a lack of confidence, that speculation is rising and that investors are waving goodbye to Europe, thus giving speculation free rein. The euro as a currency is heading for disaster, since the markets are tending to reject it. This is the result you have achieved. Congratulations! Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a few hours ago President Van Rompuy declared that the Member States need to renounce their sovereignty in order to find a solution to rescue the economic and financial situation in the euro area and in Europe. This could prove a huge sacrifice for those who, every day, or at least during celebrations, such as the 150th anniversary of the unification of Italy, flock together and pride themselves on symbols of national unity and flags. It may be less of a sacrifice for us representatives of Padania, but I ask President Van Rompuy and the other exponents of the European elite: what will we get in return for renouncing our national sovereignty? A bluff, because where are we going to get, for example, the EUR 400-600 billion in aid that Italy is being promised, at least according to the rumours that are circulating? Certainly not from the International Monetary Fund. As regards intervention by the European Central Bank, there is the seemingly insurmountable obstacle of the Treaties, and so we ask ourselves: are these requests genuine, or are they a bluff? Are we taking things seriously? What are we talking about? I believe that Italy’s present situation, with its three-year government bonds standing at 8%, does not offer much in the way of hope, at least not in the short and medium terms. This is extremely worrying! I should also like to learn more about the Plan B that various States are rumoured to be preparing – it is even being said that Germany is preparing to mark euros with an indelible inscription that is supposed to guarantee the German character of those euros.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would say to Mr Posselt that sovereignty represents the cultural and hence political identity of the Member States. It is inalienable from the point of view of, say, belonging, and the Union that our free countries have built through European integration must never overlook, overshadow or abolish the principle of national sovereignty, which must remain in force unless we accept – which we shall never do – a certain principle: that of the construction of a superstate that destroys the identity and hence also the rights and freedoms of the individual States and the individual regions.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to talk of the usual programme of cuts to financial revenue and the fight against speculation, but I hear little of anything concrete. Instead, one should speak clearly about separating banks that are collection oriented from those that are speculation oriented, such as Goldman Sachs, which, in fact, seems to have become the calling card with which you present us the saviours of Greece and the saviours of Italy. I do not believe in a European Union which imposes these characters as a diktat
, these characters who are all authoritative members of those estimable consortia such as the Trilateral Commission or the Bilderberg Club, which also bring together the protagonists, the heads of the European Union, without admitting any outsiders, because these protagonists are from a place where secret decisions are made – decisions which then have an impact on the people. You always talk about cuts – cuts on the real economy and cuts on salaries and pensions, but never about cuts on the profits made by banks, and never about cuts on finance chiefs. What a great epilogue for our country’s celebrations for 150 years of national unity – the total sell-out of Italian sovereignty to the mighty powers of the lords of the world! Congratulations!

 Opposition to Bulgaria and Romania joining the Schengen area is due to what should be one of the mainstays of European policy: the precautionary principle. In fact, it is to be expected that some Member States, already subject to intense flows of immigration, may be put under increasing strain with the entry into the Schengen area of two countries that do not seem to have achieved sufficient control of their external borders. This is particularly clear with regard to the border between Bulgaria and Turkey. We cannot allow the free movement of citizens unless we are satisfied that this does not lead to increases in petty crime and illegal immigration, reductions in security and risks to public order. The data on the fight against organised crime in these two countries are hardly comforting for those who desire to see a serious and effective EU policy against organised crime. Mario Borghezio,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Angelides report by the US Congress Commission of inquiry has clearly demonstrated that the crisis was avoidable and has pointed the finger at public operators and the financial system, referring to those responsible by name: the Federal Reserve, rating agencies, investment banks and the five major US banks responsible have all been blamed for the ongoing crisis. Even today, these practices are going on. The Commission of inquiry’s findings were preceded by the very serious, yet unheeded, warning that was also given by the crisis committee led by the Nobel Prize-winning economist, Maurice Allais. Unfortunately, the report does not say much about all this and, bowing to the superior knowledge of those economists – nearly all of them in fact – who were unable to predict the crisis, it overlooks today what is a key proposal for those who want to get to the root of the problem: to re-establish the principles of the Glass-Steagall Act, aimed at separating the activities of traditional banks from those of investment and merchant banks – speculation, in other words – and to prohibit the creation and trading of financial derivatives. The report also disregards one of the key aspects of this powerful formula, which is necessary to ensure a financial recovery and to successfully combat corruption through the use of drastic measures. Lastly, how can one ignore the negative impact of the crisis on a serious problem such as immigration? Mario Borghezio,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate comes at a very opportune time, a time that follows an emergency that it would not be right nor intelligent to underestimate, if only we think of what is happening and, unfortunately, will perhaps continue to happen, in Libya. With these scenes in North Africa, do we want to disregard the possibility that there can be an emergency two times, 10 times, God forbid, one hundred times greater? A great French author, Jean Raspail, had predicted it many decades ago, and today we are very close to this situation. So let us give it proper consideration before criminalising a small liberal country such as Denmark, which decides to defend its own borders. I am prepared to praise borders, and we should not criminalise the existence of borders. When controls are needed and when a country considers prioritising the safety of its citizens, it is necessary to respect that decision and that should be democracy according to the rules shared by all European countries. Thus let us pay great attention to and let us reflect with great concern on the danger of a biblical exodus from Africa. This danger exists and is very close, very close indeed … (The President cut off the speaker) Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have two observations to make with regard to the own-initiative report on the common agricultural policy. The first is that the consumer prices of agricultural products must be commensurate with the costs, effort and work, but also with the production costs, if we want European consumers to be able to eat healthy products of European agriculture, of the traditional agriculture that must be preserved. The second comment concerns a signal to the competent European authorities. Are they aware of the report by the Italian Carabinieri of the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies concerning milk quotas? This report clearly shows that the milk production quota, which was supposed to have been exceeded, thus forming the legal basis for the fines levied on Italian dairy farmers, was not in fact exceeded. This is very serious, because these fines could bring thousands of farms in Padania to their knees and drive them to bankruptcy. Free Padania! Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of Greece I will say that one only needs to listen to what has been discussed to realise what stage European governance is at. In fact it is steering by sight, with no precise aims. We have not been told anything for which I would keep my fingers crossed if I were a Greek citizen – perhaps a Greek worker or a small Greek entrepreneur facing ruin. As regards immigration, I have heard Italy criticised for not wanting to accept any refugees. A few hours ago, however, Mrs Malmström issued a public statement saying that when the tragedy of the Libyan exodus began everyone undertook to receive at least 800 refugees per country. In practice, nobody is receiving them, and she highlighted the positive case of Norway. They land in Lampedusa and a few in Malta, and we are the only ones taking them in. Italy has received them. Italy. People were talking about Minister Bossi, and there is also the Home Affairs Minister, Mr Maroni: both ministers are from this racist Lega Nord
 party, which has received the refugees. Unless there is proof to the contrary, that is the truth. Lastly there is the Croatia chapter. It is very important for Croatia to join, but it is also important to remember that the Pope warned the Croats to beware of a bureaucratic, centralist structure. Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, Article 4(2) of the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union states that verification, in accordance with evaluation procedures, that the necessary conditions for the application of the Schengen acquis have been met by the new Member States is an essential requirement for the Council to decide to abolish internal border controls with those States. Now, we believe that there would be an urgent need to establish regulatory and operational conditions preventing undesirable elements, who could undermine the security of Member States, from slipping into the EU unnoticed via Bulgaria and Romania, but our assessment is that those conditions do not exist today. The reports being discussed in Parliament are not reassuring because of the grave deficiencies which still exist at air, land and sea borders, starting with the performance of border controls. It is not surprising that our police forces are faced with numerous cases of illegal immigrants coming from those two countries every day. I suggest that we need to suspend the entry process to the Schengen scheme for Bulgaria and Romania as a precaution, not least in view of the foreseeably enormous pressure on the external borders of these two countries, which are becoming the holes in the Swiss cheese that is the European Union system regarding the entry of illegal immigrants.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this issue has the merit of having brought great hypocrisy to light. The only government within the European Union that has an interior minister from a party which you define as populist is the one that has had the courage to implement the most humanitarian measure: giving 25 000 Tunisian people permission to move freely. This is because we saw in the flesh that they were not 25 000 criminals, but people who had fled Tunisia. It was an emergency, we had to face it with common sense and we have tried to help. This shows a truth, namely that in many situations the real ‘goodies’ are us, the ‘baddies’. We who affirm the need to control immigration and external borders, continue to beg Europe – as Mr Cohn-Bendit has rightly done – to spread what might become 50 000 or 100 000 refugees across its territory, because the people who flee Libya are not criminals. These are the clear words of a movement which defends territory and identity, which is against immigration because it does not want people to be uprooted, and which condemns racism and xenophobia but also hypocrisy.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, despite being a Eurosceptic, I could be in favour of a plan, in view of the 2020 Strategy, to eliminate discrimination, difficulty and marginalisation if we were really being offered incisive action by the European Commission to control the behaviour of Member States. What we have, however, are these speeches about a great future, about great control, spoken by a European Commissioner who still cannot explain to me how it is that in her country, in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, these travellers are forbidden to set up camp whereas they can instead instal themselves close to my home, in Italy and in France. Thus we talk of giving a home to travellers, whilst in some European countries, specifically that of Mrs Reding, these people cannot even set up camp. In today’s edition of the main newspaper in my country, Il Corriere della Sera
, there is an article on a parent, who does not deserve to be called a parent, a traveller, who was arrested in Italy for selling her own little girl to traffickers who wanted to sell her into prostitution. She sold her own little girl. Others send them to do other things. Often it is they who do not to send them to school, despite pressure and attention from the authorities, mediators and charities. Do we want to talk about these problems as well? Do we want to do away with these salami slices of idiotic do-goodery and realise that many of the Roma’s problems are exclusively and principally of their own making? Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank Commissioner Malmström for her hard work week after week in dealing with this epic disaster – because that is what it is. Comments have been made, not only in this House, in an attempt to reduce and make light of what our government, our country and our people have had to face. It has been, and continues to be, an emergency –humanitarian and otherwise – of exceptional dimensions. I believe that our government, and especially our people, have really come out of this well in terms of international public opinion. The people of Lampedusa behaved remarkably in firstly welcoming the migrants and then helping them out of their own pockets, and then, at a certain point, they said ‘we cannot do this any more’, because in addition to the human rights we discuss every day in this House, we must also consider the rights of peoples, including their right to maintain their identity, their activities and, naturally, not to be invaded. The migrants also include illegal immigrants, criminals released from prison. This rightly concerns the countries that must accept them. Furthermore, when the migration takes on the dimension – I repeat – of an invasion, we need to face up to the issue. We are one hundred per cent with our people, no ifs or buts. The European Union must stand up and take note, Commissioner. In addition to human rights, we must consider our rights, the rights of indigenous peoples. For this reason, we fully endorse the efforts being made by Italian Government at the moment in Tunisia, because compared to the modest figures announced by the Commissioner, the Italian Government is offering Tunisia a lot. A lot is being done and we are confident we will achieve tangible results However, we must move from words to deeds and Frontex is not doing what should have been done to put an end to this hateful traffic, because this traffic is the shame of the Mediterranean and the European Union is partly responsible. Therefore, I say put a stop to people trafficking and I say yes to a Marshall Plan for these countries. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that at such a delicate time for the finances of the Member States of Europe, as was said a short time ago, I should like to sound an alarm about an expenditure that is under discussion in the Committee on Budgets: the astonishing case of the vast expenses set aside for the House of European History. I think it would be a disgrace if it were approved. We already own the Eastman Building, but between EUR 26 million and EUR 31 million have been allocated merely for renovation costs, plus EUR 3.3 million for the plans alone. The fixed costs amount to more than EUR 3 million whilst the variable costs come to EUR 3.2 million, plus EUR 3.2 million for a 50-strong staff, EUR 2 million for security and then EUR 13.45 million are required just to manage it. I think we ought to set an example of prudent spending through our institutions. This, however, would be a disgrace. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, of course we must recognise the serious errors of the West. We in Italy have made the mistake of thinking of Mr Gaddafi as ‘our son of a bitch’, as President Roosevelt would have said, while instead, he was simply one of the many sons of … that rule over their people and now even fire on them or make other people fire on them. How on earth has no one in Parliament mentioned the responsibility of the African Heads of State or Government, who, until yesterday morning, thought of him as a brother, pampered him, sent him to the United Nations as a representative leader for the defence of human rights, even leading him to declare himself the king of kings amongst African countries, or have I got the wrong person? Now, Europe is making another mistake: it pretends to ignore an obvious danger, as a great flood of Somalis, Eritreans and others flee Libya’s borders. We need to tackle this with real energy. We should use a Marshall Plan involving the network of small and medium-sized enterprises to help these people, not send weapons. *** Mario Borghezio,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not agree with the report where it says that the Commission should dictate policy on the Roma to the Member States. This approach does not obey the principle of subsidiarity, if it is true – as indeed it is – that these measures must be conceived and carried out at local, regional and national levels, since their impact is then on the regions and their native populations. I completely agree with inclusion, not discrimination, but I am still waiting to hear from Commissioner Reding when Roma camps will finally be allowed in her country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, for if I am not mistaken, they are not allowed there. This report seems to be a little unbalanced, because so many paragraphs call for support for the Roma, be they men, women, children, the elderly (...). None of them call for any measures to severely punish those Roma who show anti-social behaviour, for example. Who stops Roma children going to school, if it is not certain Roma parents? I believe these are topics that we need to have the courage to spell out clearly, defying political correctness. It is not the syrup of do-goodism but serious, surgical measures that will enable us to lance the boil of rackets, child exploitation and organ trafficking. Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Energy 2020 is a vast programme, but we should ask ourselves if we can achieve the target of 20% renewable energy by the due date, not least because the financial crisis is slowing investment. There remains one problem: supporting solar energy. Indeed, we subsidise China, now the world’s leading exporter of solar panels, and India, the leading exporter of wind power equipment. Hence the need to support research into the production of solar panels designed and produced in Europe and to promote the adoption of economies of scale in the photovoltaic-solar sector, by introducing such devices, for example, extensively in European cities. Something very different should have been done: a pan-European energy company should have been set up to safeguard a European public service, given that the distribution networks and their infrastructures already constitute existing, natural monopolies, which should clearly come under the same management. Instead, due to over-enthusiastic economic liberalism, priority was given to other solutions that certainly do not benefit consumers or users, but the shareholders of these big monopolies. We should remember that the production of CO2
 from cars has not dropped for 150 years. We are entitled to wonder if it could be time to dust off research projects into water engines. Mario Borghezio,

 Mr President, this will certainly not be remembered as an exhilarating chapter in Parliament’s history. The criticisms and attacks rained down on the Hungarian Government, in conjunction with the EU Presidency, with regard to the Hungarian media law’s alleged total failure to comply with European legislation, have been reduced to what they really are: an instrumental and specious attempt that, apart from anything else, is based entirely on ideological bias, which is even more shameful when it is used against a country that today has the struggle for freedom encoded in its DNA – and this has indeed been the case throughout its history, which we all remember very well. The political forces that have promoted this far from exhilarating debate are still heavily weighed down by the responsibility for what is certainly not a high level political manoeuvre. Rather, it is seriously invalidated by these purely ideological overtones, and it also has the failing of casting an undeserved shadow on the European Union Presidency, which is being held for the first time – and this is certainly a great political and historical fact – by a former communist country, joined with us today in freedom.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are grateful to the Commissioner for the commitments that have been made, although it should be said that with all the salaries the European Union pays around the world – with 136 diplomatic missions – it could perhaps have realised what was happening sooner. In fact, the situation was not even foreseen by the representatives of the Socialist International, one of whose members was the nice Tunisian dictator, whose brilliant social and political management of that country led to all this. We want to learn from the Commission why it does not talk to us clearly about sharing out these people among the various European countries. It is not fair – as the coastal states have been saying for a long time – that this problem should only affect the countries that have a Mediterranean sea border with North African countries. That is a fundamental point, and it is also fundamental to remember that Frontex has very limited resources: I have heard that two experts have been sent. There is a massive crisis taking place in Lampedusa, not least in humanitarian terms, which needs to be tackled with a task force of appropriate size in order to remedy the mistakes and failures of the recent past. The situation is extremely serious and it may also get worse from a public health point of view, since water has perhaps already begun to run out in Lampedusa. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council needs to look at the fact that Europe’s production system has no defence against the volatility of oil prices on the markets, because futures markets are being held hostage to sophisticated international financial speculation, meaning that prices now have very little to do with the fundamental principles of supply and demand. The Council must set itself the goal of providing the European Union with a practical instrument with which to create a regulated market, open to selected traders and managed by a completely trustworthy European partner. This is the thrust of an Italian Government proposal to create a European oil exchange aimed at establishing a stable oil market, which would be of huge benefit to businesses and consumers. Speculators’ enthusiasm for commodities is influencing oil prices, which are no longer based on the spot market, since the cumulative effect of advances and speculative manoeuvres ends up determining supply and demand in the real market. A European exchange would transform the current ‘non-market’ of paper barrels into an efficient, regulated and monitored real market based on real barrels of oil. We ought to discuss this with the Council as well. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a law has been passed in the United States requiring the Federal Reserve to detail how much of the USD 3 300 billion rescue package has gone to which banks. I wonder whether it would be subversive to ask you to adopt the same transparency criteria, unless the finance and banking super-lobby blocks it. Let us consider the situation: what future is there for this forced Union of free countries, which is based on the stronger countries bailing out the weaker ones? Technically, do we want to acknowledge reality, which is that the euro is a virtually bankrupt currency? How can we think of forcing countries with a weak economy to use it? Is a centralised monetary policy acceptable for countries that have such decidedly diverse interest rates? Mr Trichet himself, who has denied the danger of the European Central Bank becoming insolvent, does, however, admit that one of the reasons behind increasing its capital is to face up to the credit risk, in other words, the insolvency of the bonds purchased. It is also time for new stress tests on the largest banks and to give greater weight to high-risk bank debts, as the Minister for the Economy has requested.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, in the prevailing relativism of European politics, there is one word that is taboo: Christianophobia. For many years, however, serious and often tragic reports have been coming in from reliable and indisputable sources about the persecution of Christians on several continents. Europe needs to wake up, open its eyes and take concrete action. It needs to send out clear messages, such as the one we were expecting from Baroness Ashton. She could, for example, have quoted Pope Benedict’s inspired words for the World Day of Peace a few days ago, when he pointed out that to deny religious freedom is an insult to God and to human dignity, as well as a threat to security and peace. Concrete action is needed. What are we waiting for – as I asked straight away – to send a commission to check the situation of our Coptic Christian brethren in Egypt, an officially moderate country where they have practically no fundamental human rights at all, not even in public office, in the civil service? Wake up, wretched Europe, and remember your Christian roots! Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the New York Times 
revelations, investigations are ongoing in the United States into the secret club of nine banks – one of which is European – whose executives meet every Wednesday to agree what action to take on derivatives. The Crisis Committee was completely unaware and Europe is a mere spectator. The Federal Reserve had to account for the USD 13 trillion spent to bail out the banks. Would you mind telling us what the Fed asked for the European bank rescue packages? Is it not the critical situation in the banks – and not state budgets – that requires the sum in the European rescue fund to be doubled and the preparation of a EUR 2 000 billion bail-out? What is stopping us calling on the European Central Bank to account transparently and in detail for its actions as was done in the United States for the Fed? This would put paid to suspicions that  it acted and continues to act discretionally and not in the common interest of the citizens and taxpayers of the European Union’s Member States. Why on earth have discussions never been held over the adoption of measures to impose a genuine and effective separation between commercial banks and speculative banks, as in the Glass-Steagall Act?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the responses concerning Mr Assange’s case and his imprisonment on account of his ideas of freedom are reminiscent of those of Pontius Pilate. I would like us to consider three points: 1. This is a case of fumus persecutionis
, because the accusations are very weak; 2. the United States is putting pressure on a European country to extradite, even though it has not yet specified the legal grounds for this request; 3. a citizen’s European bank accounts have been closed, meaning that he cannot receive any financial assistance in Europe from his supporters. What is more, all the statistics confirm that the European public is in favour of these principles of freedom, that it wants Internet freedom, that it is in favour of freedom, despite the doubts and the problems that have emerged in the wake of this initiative, which I personally do not fully support. Nevertheless, we would like President Barroso to state what the limits are and what the protection of human rights and of freedom of expression is really and truly founded on. Are we looking at a virtual Guantánamo here? Are we facing the threat of an Orwellian total censorship of the Internet? That is the danger, and we need answers on this matter. It is also important to keep a check on Mr Assange’s prison conditions, because in Italy, not even Mafia members are held in complete isolation. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ears of the President of the European Central Bank, Mr Trichet, must really be burning as this debate continues. If we were in the ancient Roman senate, a senator would surely stand up in his toga and say to Mr Trichet: ‘Quousque tandem abutere
, Trichete, patientia nostra?
’ – how long are you going to try our patience, Mr Trichet? In effect, we must ask ourselves whether the right road is to avoid the dissolution of the euro – a very difficult task – or instead prevent the rescue of the euro from ruining the economies of our Member States after the europhile policies of Mr Prodi and so on have destroyed our industries, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, in Padania for example, bringing only redundancies and unemployment benefit. Why should the countries which are surviving the crisis be bled dry to the tune of almost EUR 100 billion to save Ireland which, with its policy of 12.5% business tax,, has until now been competing unfairly with the other countries? Where was European governance if, one month after passing its stress tests, the Anglo Irish Bank plunged to a deficit of EUR 8 billion? Where was Mr Trichet? Are we sure that the Irish bailout does not violate the Treaty of Maastricht? Fortunately there is a constitutional court in Germany that will declare that the absorption of another country’s deficit onto Germany’s books is unconstitutional. So it is time to say bye-bye euro, bye-bye euro. Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should like to express my sincere and earnest thanks to the rapporteur, whose skills and rigour have been put to good use in guaranteeing Member States that granting free passage to Taiwanese nationals and abolishing visas will not cause problems for the European Union. I am not so convinced about the latest work regarding Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania. Now there is even talk of abolishing visas for Turkey. In those situations, I am not convinced that the Commission and Parliament have done their job well, namely: ensuring the safety of European citizens. Therefore, I applaud the report and the vote in the European Parliament – which will surely be positive – all the more. History is not impermanent. People of a certain age remember what it was that what was once called Nationalist China represented for decades: it was a banner of freedom. The West must not forget who defended the principles of liberty when they were under threat elsewhere. Still now, in terms of human rights, I think a basic distinction must be made. The Chinese of Taiwan are therefore also welcome in my home region of Padania. The presence of such important and skilled individuals in the region already provides ample illustration of the ability of Taiwanese people to integrate into our society. Unlike other countries, Taiwan also has the merit of not exporting socio-political messages against the principles of liberty, the protection of human rights and respect for ethnic and religious minorities to the European Union together with its goods. The citizens of Taiwan are therefore welcome in the European Union and in Padania. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply wanted to call the attention of the President of the European Parliament to a judgment made several days ago. It is a matter that surely falls under the capacities of the Commissioner, to whom I extend my greetings. In my opinion, it is a very serious judgment, because it relativises the content of a very important European Union directive on terrorism. In fact, I believe that it is not possible to support an extensive attitude to protecting citizens who request the right of asylum and the right to be recognised as a refugee to those who belong to terrorist organisations. If this principle were to become accepted, as it did in this extremely serious decision of the European Court of Justice, we shall give many terrorists the chance to benefit from protection that they do not deserve. Too many people have died in Europe as a result of acts of terrorism to allow a situation of this type. I therefore urge the Commission to modify the directive so as to avoid extensive and indecent interpretations of the statement that the European Union rightly made in the fight against terrorism.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should have listened to the advice of the Nobel laureate, Maurice Allais, who called for a clear separation between business banks, credit banks and speculative banks, in accordance with the principles of the Glass-Steagall Act, which is not discussed in this report. As far as the proposal to tax European taxpayers is concerned, my response is ‘No tax in Europe!’ If this European Union proposal goes ahead, you can rest assured that we will have our own Tea Party here as well: there will be a mass protest. The European public has no intention of paying for a service they are not getting and they are perfectly right. We are continuing to fund the banks. However, what are the banks doing in the midst of this economic and financial crisis? They are buying securities, even ones that contain dodgy derivatives and so on. They are still buying them. And what is the ECB doing while this is going on? The ECB – set up to be an unchallengeable body – is letting it go on. It seems clear to me that this is a Europe for bankers. If even the Masonic leaders claim this to be true, I do not see why we cannot claim it too. We believe that there is only one way to combat speculation effectively: transactions carried out at the same time as negotiations are paid for, and only in cash. Mrs Merkel dared to say it and she was shouted down. There must be some reason for that. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Madam President, this is an important and significant report for the protection of women. The European institutions, however, suffer from the major fault of not practising what they preach. Last Friday and Saturday, a meeting attended by the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, the President of Parliament and President Van Rompuy was held with dignitaries from the most important European Masonic lodges, yet not a single word was said about the fact that most of these lodges do not allow women to join. More seriously, the meeting was held inside the European Parliament, behind closed doors, and not even Parliament’s own staff were allowed in. All that stands in contrast to the principles of transparency that should govern all activities of the European institutions. Mario Borghezio,

 Mr President, we will vote against this report not least because the rapporteur proposes exerting pressure on the Commission and the Council to speed up the process of visa liberalisation for Kosovo. Do we realise what we are discussing? Do we realise that Kosovo is finding it difficult to reintegrate the thousands of Roma who sought asylum in Germany? This is an extremely sensitive situation for the entire European Union. Do we realise that visa liberalisation – which I have heard said will be used only by students and respectable people, even though I personally do not agree at all with that optimistic statement – will simply mean that Europe becomes a hotbed of Roma? We really do not need this, considering the serious problems we are facing with integration and resolving the extremely severe problem of the Roma. As far as Albania is concerned, I would like to point out that the Commission again proposed in May that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina should be able to allow their citizens to circulate within the Schengen area with electronic passports. The proposal was not, however, taken forward due to Albania’s shortcomings with regard to reintegrating repatriated Albanians. I believe that security and control issues exist that weigh on visa liberalisation like boulders. We need to think about this very carefully: visas are necessary, and how! Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also award the prize for hypocrisy to Mrs Reding, who forgot to describe – at least according to the texts – the situation of the Roma in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, where the problem of expelling Roma does not exist simply because the setting up of Roma camps is not allowed by law; it is forbidden. Thus, there are many different ‘Europes’. I hope that this is an indication of what is to come: at this European Council, at last, a Head of State or Government felt compelled to teach the European Commission a clear lesson in patriotism. The Commission must not, not even through its Commissioners, allow itself to insult a Member State, in particular, a Member State such as France which could give us all a lesson on the concepts of freedom and humanity. There is a huge difference between what you call European law and the law of the peoples. European law is perhaps the right to enter other people’s houses and steal, not to send your children to school and to exploit them, as asserted not by racist populism, but – according to Le Monde
 – as asserted by the Prime Minister of Romania during the ‘déjeuner de fiel
’ – the ‘lunch as bitter as bile’ – on 16 September. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we did not vote for the motion for a resolution by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which is certainly more balanced, because of one key point to which we wish to draw your attention: the call for the European Commission, for Europe, to speed up the process to integrate Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen area. We feel – and we already sounded this alarm at the time of enlargement – that these countries have not yet adopted strict control policies for the issue of identity cards and recognition of nationality. Are the Commission and Parliament aware that in these countries certificates can be obtained with great ease from non-European countries enabling, thanks to the freedom of movement, illegal entry into the Schengen area? We must pay close attention to this matter, and it is completely irresponsible not to have done so, and to be pressing for the enlargement of the Schengen area, contrary to common sense. Lastly, I would like to voice my hope that, when we next meet, at least one of the do-gooder MEPs who are so supportive of the Roma will report that he or she has taken in – they can afford this on an MEP’s salary – a nice Roma family, and are feeding a few extra mouths. It is not hard to show with actions, instead of just with words, that you are a do-gooder. Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to the attacks against the French Government, like those against the Italian Government previously, and also to some very strong attacks against the Commission. These accusations are completely spurious in actual fact. I have not heard any reference to the statistics supplied by the French police authorities showing that, in the 18 months following the exodus of Roma from Bulgaria and Romania, the number of thefts rose by more than 250%. In this connection, perhaps Romania and Bulgaria should be forced to answer some questions, after they were very irresponsibly allowed to enter the European Union without this problem having first been resolved. We must speak frankly to those people, too, who come over as guests of other states. We must tell them to respect the citizens of their host states and not enter their homes illegally and perform acts unbecoming of a guest. They must be respected and they must be protected – in the words of those who speak of high principles – but we must also consider the victims of their crimes: the other honest citizens of the European Union who, perhaps with good reason, do not always enjoy having the Roma as their neighbours. These are the uncomfortable facts that the majority of citizens and people think and that certain do-gooders do not have the courage to admit, because, the truth is, sometimes you also have to have the political courage to say ...

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am very pleased that you are the guardian of the treaties. In actual fact, the Commission also guards the Commission’s own secrets so well that it is very difficult for us MEPs, for example, to obtain extensive and, above all, in-depth information about what takes place behind closed doors in your meetings, despite the fact that the Commissioners have not been elected by our peoples and should therefore feel all the more bound to observe their duty of communication and transparency. For example, I am still waiting for an answer – and not the ironic answer I have been given – to my question so that I can circulate the truth in the newspapers. Is or was President Barroso a member of the Bilderberg Club or not? Does he frequent it or not? The answer I was given, and which I published in my press releases, in other words, was as follows: ‘Mr Borghezio, you know more than us about the Bilderberg Group’ is a little odd, and I would therefore like more information on the subject. For example, what information has the international press given on the background to the financial crisis? The Lisbon strategy was quoted; that is very interesting. It is like looking at a set of Chinese boxes when you come to establish the true owners of the large financial groups to which the leading newspapers and mass media belong; they could be based in tax havens for all we know. I believe that you would do very well to champion an initiative aimed at really disclosing what goes on behind the scenes of politics, finance and the economy. These are very interesting subjects and have widespread relevance to citizens, who have a right to be kept fully informed. I note, and would emphasise, the silence of the left wing with regard to the Bilderberg Club and the Trilateral Commission. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the measures for the supervision of the European financial system must – and this should be better emphasised in the report – have a priority objective, which must be very clear and strongly supported: to establish strict rules to control the derivatives market as this is one of the main causes, if not the main cause, of the current financial crisis. Here, instead, we are, above all, designing a centralised institution, to some extent copied from the model of the ECB. This is not good, because at this point it is not known or fully clear what the role of the national supervisory bodies will be – the Banca d'Italia
 in our country. It seems that they are being watered down somewhat to the role of agent, which is not a particularly well-defined role. Instead, oversight should begin in our countries. In Italy, for example, it happens via a system of local branches which can monitor situations well. Furthermore, why should the headquarters of the European agency be in Frankfurt? Who decided that? Based on what criteria, if not in order – I would say – to make it conformant with the European Central Bank? We propose it be sited in Milan, for example, which is a major financial and banking market, including from a geo-economic point of view due to its position at the centre of Europe. I believe that this plan should generally go much deeper, with measures that require courage to implement, such as introducing a separation between commercial and investment banks in European legislation, based on the principles of the old US law. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, while we are discussing these various issues, there is a lively debate under way in the United States on what I consider to be a crucial question, namely, a return to the principles of the Glass-Steagall Act and the separation of ordinary banks from the speculating banks that caused the extremely serious problems for which our economies and peoples are paying a heavy price. While solutions are being put to us here, 10 days ago, behind closed doors in the secrecy of the Bilderberg Club meetings, a large number of senior bureaucrats and European political leaders came together, probably to lay down instructions for the directives that will subsequently be presented to the European Parliament, which will have no other choice but to consider them. Moreover, this morning I heard Mr Barroso’s appeal to provide aid to our Greek friends. I would not want the aid mainly going to his friend, the shipowner Spiros Latsis. There is a clear conflict of interest here for Mr Barroso, who should account for this. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how long will the euro last in its current form? Are we perhaps headed towards its destructuring within a year or two? I do not agree with creating a new supplementary deficit of EUR 750 billion to cover an earlier one or that these measures are sufficient for building the socio-economic future of 500 million Europeans, nor do I agree with the dogma of saving the euro as it is, because it should be done by keeping the euro as low as possible and reducing the interest rate to inject capital into productive investments for our industries, which are gasping for air, rather than into public financing. I do not agree with the European Commission expecting to review and audit the accounting of Member States’ budgets before the national parliaments: farewell to sovereignty. I disagree with an economic and financial strategy that fails to contemplate specific needs. Mario Borghezio  (EFD
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, an industrial policy that focuses exclusively on companies operating internationally and using advanced technologies is not the best route to success. We must not forget the whole small and medium enterprise sector, including both small-scale manufacturers and retailers. Innovation policy should be aimed at them also. In particular, this strategy should guarantee conditions that place small and medium-sized enterprises on an equal footing with their competitors outside the EU by adopting safeguard clauses and strong, effective measures to combat the extremely serious problem of counterfeiting, including through effective trade defence instruments. It is important that governance of the Europe 2020 strategy should not rest in the hands of the Commission alone, but should be carried out at different levels, including the national and macro-regional levels. We need to start formulating a policy and strategy that focus on the local level and the reality of manufacturing on the ground, and I would like to stress here the need for attention to be paid to the manufacturing situation in Padania. In other words, we are asking for more attention to be paid to the actual manufacturing situation on the ground, focusing, in particular, on the SME structure, as I said, which is the backbone of manufacturing in every country in Europe and is therefore where the real hope for the future of manufacturing and development of the European Union lies. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that we are here discussing and examining the content of this Europe 2020 strategy, while in Athens workers are dying, and a country, a nation is on the edge of a precipice, paints a rather telling, or, I would go so far as to say, grotesque, picture of European politics. It is absolutely remarkable that in a situation of this kind, the Commission does not feel that it should take a good, long look at itself, because it is not as though it does not realise that this crisis, which in some respects has now reached, I would say, dramatic proportions, is a consequence of many serious mistakes, as demonstrated by the failure of the Lisbon strategy. Many mistakes and one defendant in the dock: the euro. You come here saying, in all your statements, that Greece is a one-off, but will you be saying that when – although let us hope not – another similar situation arises, for example in Spain: will that be another one-off? We here are a bit tired of hearing the one-off excuse: the subprime crisis was also a one-off. It is hard to believe and very difficult to accept what the Commission is saying when the European Union has not yet decided to clean up Europe’s banks and to tell savers, manufacturers and the real economy how much muck there still is in European banks, in order to develop a strategy. We must keep these points in mind and remember that a serious strategy must be based on the real economy, on the small and medium-sized enterprise system, and naturally it must give a responsible role to workers, through their participation, too. Matteo Salvini,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, procedure is one thing: we delegate choices regarding trade policy to the Commission, and that is only right. However, the substance of the matter is something else. What we, the group of the Northern League, representing the regions of Northern Italy, are worried about are the decisions on trade, the progressive reduction of duties, the lack of any industrial policy, and concession of advantages to multinationals. In other words, it is acceptable that Parliament should delegate decisions to the Commission at a technical level, but it is not a good thing that we are slaves and victims of the outdated economic and industrial policy of the World Trade Organisation, which favours the large foreign powers, making no effort to defend our manufacturers. I am not sure if you are aware of the number of small and medium-sized enterprises that are closing in Lombardy and Veneto due to trade agreements that offer no protection to our products. It would be a mistake to believe that research and innovation alone will take us very far. There is a real risk that we will become like the countries of Eastern or Northern Europe, the United States or Asia, where all of the shopping malls now belong to the large multinationals. Therefore, as Parliament, we should delegate the power to adopt these acts regarding trade policy to the Commission, in the hope, however, that the Commission will revise, modernise and defend a manufacturing and trade system that will otherwise disappear.

 With all due respect for your work and that of others, I invite you to come and see for yourself the extent to which agreements with the World Trade Organisation have a positive or negative effect on enterprises in Northern Italy. In half an hour we will be speaking about the Chinese photovoltaic industry. I think that Europe, as it is structured today, counts for little or nothing. I do not know whether the individual states would count for more. What I do know is that the trade policy pursued in this regard by the European Commission is a complete failure for our enterprises. A completely free market is of no use to anyone. Matteo Salvini,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I feel ashamed. While enterprises are closing and workers being made redundant, you come here and tell us we are the most open market in the world and that this investigation will issue its findings in nine months. Somebody here seems to have forgotten why he is being paid a salary by the European taxpayers. If Mr De Gucht says that the trade war is not China’s fault, that is nonetheless an indication that someone has declared war. We can hardly argue with the fact that many enterprises are closing and laying off their workers, or is this not the case in Brussels? Instead of MEPs, I would like to see here today those workers who have lost their jobs and those businesspeople who have seen 30 or 40 or 50 years of work go up smoke for reasons that are obvious to us all. Does anyone here really doubt that China engages in unfair trade, exploits workers, illegally subsidises its enterprises and ignores environmental issues? Does anyone have any questions that cannot be resolved in nine days rather than nine months? I am ashamed to represent a Europe that by the end of this investigation will have no photovoltaic industry left. For some people, the words ‘import duty’ are taboo. Well then certain people should either impose import duties to get things done, or otherwise resign, because nine months is too long to spend investigating the obvious. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by Ms Collin-Langen. The text adopted by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is a balanced text that seems to take account of the real reasons why some of the Directive’s objectives have not been achieved. However, I would have given greater consideration to the impact this crisis has had on citizens and the consequent widespread mistrust of consumer credit. Within the European Union, the situation can vary significantly from Member State to Member State.

 I decided to vote in favour of this report because the measure will simplify the current regulatory framework and will introduce new administrative and technical requirements concerning the environment, safety and market surveillance for two- and three-wheeled vehicles and quadricycles. The issues that, to my mind, require further attention are identification of the scope of the proposal for a regulation to remove some inconsistencies and reflect the categories of manufacture, make the timetable for application simple and clear to prevent problems for manufacturers with having to introduce the new features required by the regulation too quickly, and introduction of environmental requirements that manufacturers do not find it excessively difficult to comply with.

 I decided to vote in favour of this measure because it updates the rules on the type-approval of agricultural and forestry vehicles with a view to ensuring the functioning of the internal market, while at the same time providing for a high level of environmental protection and road safety. One aspect worthy of mention is access to vehicle repair and maintenance information. The justifiable need to provide information for the repair of vehicles has been balanced by the need to protect information valuable to competitors, especially in Asia, who want to copy the best technical solutions in the sector.

 I hardly need to say that the single market has certainly benefited citizens and businesses. For this reason I voted in favour. The problem, however, is that, unlike our competitors such as the US, the trade policy pursued by the European Commission with third countries does not put us in a position to protect our interests. Similarly, the single market cannot be invoked as the solution to every problem in Europe. Often it is actually poorly conceived directives, like the Services Directive, that give our workers and businesses enormous problems. Bring on the single market, but let it not be an instrument designed solely around the needs of multinationals. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted against this proposal and I am pleased that there was a majority of MEPs who shared my position. The relevant committee for this matter asked the Council to present a female candidate and, having been ignored, reacted negatively to the recommendation to appoint Yves Mersch as a Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB). I do not have sufficient information to say whether Mr Mersch deserves this post or not, but I cannot fail to take into consideration the fact that appointing a man would mean that there would be no women on the ECB’s Executive Board until 2018.

 I voted in favour of this provision. Some European Court of Justice rulings and the strict rules imposed by the World Trade Organisation severely restrict our freedom to legislate to protect European industry and workers against counterfeit goods and goods produced without respect for social and environmental standards.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has been awarded a Nobel Prize, no less! If only its citizens could hear some of the speeches made in this Parliament. Where is all this dialogue, this respect for human rights and tolerance? I hope that the Commission presses ahead with its project that from a technical, economic and social point of view is useful for dialogue, useful to consumers, useful to enterprises and useful to workers in Israel, be they Jews, Christians or Muslims. Israel has provided us with a model to strive for and to compete with in terms of pharmaceutical research, The sad thing is that we do not hear the same kind of indignation in this House from hypocritical left-wing parties when human rights are ignored in other parts of the world, in North Africa, in the Middle East. You can continue this Israel-Palestine derby all you like, but nobody will ever win it. I hope that this agreement will be a small contribution to peace in the area.

Under this agreement some of the benefits of the internal market would be extended to aligned sectors and facilitate access to the Israeli market, removing technical barriers to trade for industrial products.

Other important questions are also dealt with, such as removal of trade barriers, the introduction of measures to ensure better market access, including for investment, the protection of intellectual property rights, the opening up of public procurement markets to ensure full reciprocity and convergence on mutual recognition of regulatory standards.

On the contrary, such a labelling system has proved to be effective, enabling consumers to make informed choices regarding their purchases, by ensuring that additional information is provided in a harmonised and certified manner.

On several occasions, Parliament asked to have the issue of geographical indications included in ACTA, but Commissioner De Gucht was not able to negotiate this with his counterparts. The doubts over the infringement of fundamental rights are too serious to approve such an agreement.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as usual, I fear that someone is wasting your time and trying to hoodwink citizens, entrepreneurs and Internet users in Europe, in Italy and, as far as I am concerned, in Padania. We are debating an agreement involving just a handful of countries, one that excludes 95% of countries engaged in exporting counterfeit goods, so effectively it is much ado about nothing. The Commissioner talks about defending businesses and jobs, and then goes and signs free trade agreements with Morocco, Korea, Pakistan and India. We remove tariffs, barriers and protections to help banks, insurance companies and multinationals from Northern Europe, and then try to muzzle the web by selling it as a way of defending our businesses. No one is falling for it any more, Commissioner. Go and inspect the ports in northern Europe, the port of Rotterdam for example, if you want to fight counterfeiting; do not try and gag anyone. If you really want to do something tangible about it, take the first plane to China, India or Indonesia and bring home something tangible, or else resign. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted in favour of this report. This is a big step forward in protecting people with coeliac disease. The Commission’s proposal has been improved by the Members’ amendments, especially those by Italian Members. There is profound ignorance about coeliac disease in various Member States: it is neither a fad, nor an allergy. Coeliac disease is an illness and the words ‘gluten free’ on food products cannot be trivialised as a simple claim or allergen. Coeliacs cannot eat any gluten whatsoever.

 The motion for a resolution, which is the result of the work carried out by the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, is very interesting and contains references which I believe will be useful in helping the Commission understand possible future single market scenarios. However I voted against the resolution because I believe there are premises in the text that are wrong. Rating the single market too highly as a solution to the crisis or claiming that its completion would automatically lead to growth throughout the Union means saying things that are not true.

 I voted against Mr Fjellner’s report, even though the Commission’s proposal is, without doubt, an improvement on the previous scheme of generalised tariff preferences, and despite the fact that the Council introduced a number of additional restrictions for the GSP+ scheme during negotiations with Parliament. Unfortunately, however, a country such as Pakistan – a serious threat to EU textile businesses, which continue to hold strong – would soon be able to benefit from the GSP+ scheme.

 The mobilisation of funds to help the regions affected by the tragic events in Liguria is a necessity. The European Union Solidarity Fund is a very important instrument that brings Europeans much closer together than many political or legislative initiatives. When casting my vote in favour, my thoughts turned to those people who were bereaved and lost everything in the floods. Given that these events are happening more and more frequently, I think that the time has come, in collaboration with the European Commission, to establish a programme to identify suitable instruments with which to invest in innovation and prevention in Europe.

 I voted in favour of the report. I think it is right that at last we have a general legislative instrument valid for any future macro-financial assistance for third countries. I supported the main proposals made by the rapporteur, even though I did not share his concern regarding the need to involve our Parliament more fully in future measures of macro-financial assistance. In my opinion, the procedure initially proposed by the European Commission, which provided for the involvement of the Council but not of the European Parliament could have been maintained. However, the members of the Committee on International Trade preferred to bring in changes that will make negotiations with the Council very long and difficult to resolve. I express my hope, in any case, that the rapporteur will be successful in the negotiations with the colegislator. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted for the report and I congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work. The problems that China creates for our production system are well known: for many years now, my political movement, Lega Nord
, has been expressing its concern over the relocation of our enterprises to Asia, the social dumping that adversely affects our workers, and the risks associated with the arrival on our territory of products that are dangerous and do not comply with our rules. For these reasons, it is right that the European Commission should make a serious, concrete commitment to demanding reciprocity and setting in motion a genuine strategy to protect our production system and revitalise a genuine industrial policy.

 I want to vote against this measure and I would like to explain the political reasons that led me to make this decision. We need to give a signal to the European Commission so that it will represent us effectively at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Yet another European defeat in a dispute with China at the WTO would today force Parliament to delete an article in our Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation. It is wrong not to stand up more strongly to international bodies like the WTO. It is wrong not to defend our industry. It is wrong not to ask China for reciprocal openings for our products and services. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 My vote in favour of this measure is not just a duty. In actual fact, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules require the European Union to remove the rules imposing restrictions on the import of products from other members of the WTO. Since Russia has now become a member of the WTO, unless we had voted to repeal certain rules today, we would have been subject to certain sanctions which would have damaged our production and our businesses.

 I voted with absolute conviction against this report. I understand Mr Rinaldi’s position, but I do not share his enthusiastically positive stance on the outcomes of the so-called Arab Spring. I do not agree on his call for the creation of a free trade area with the countries of North Africa, which would seriously damage our textiles industry and agriculture, which have already been hampered by an unprecedented crisis. Lastly, I do not approve of the general tone of the report, which focuses exclusively on protecting and promoting the interests of the other party, while completely forgetting to refer to and defend legitimate EU trading interests. It seems more like a report by the Committee on Development than one by the Committee on International Trade. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted in favour of this agreement, as I did for the similar measure relating to Liberia. However, I remain doubtful about the actual possibility of its implementation by the Central African Republic. The European Commission will be responsible for monitoring in order to ensure that the forestry heritage of this country does not suffer irreversible damage and that a stop is put to illegal logging, a real scourge afflicting the entire African continent. In any case, my vote in favour was also meant as a vote of faith in the two parties to the agreement. I sincerely hope that the forest law enforcement, governance and trade (FLEGT) measures will prove to be effective and useful for preserving nature and creating development in certain areas of the planet.

Therefore, my vote in favour was also meant as a vote of faith in the two parties to the agreement.

 I voted in favour of these amendments to the European Fisheries Fund. The measure will involve no cost to the EU because the funds advanced to Member States in economic difficulties will be offset before the end of the programme.

 I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for her success in proposing numerous amendments within the Committee on International Trade to a proposal from the Commission that contained some highly unacceptable passages such as the extension of time limits for reaching the decision to introduce trade duties. These actions are necessary in order to safeguard our production system and therefore require speed, not more bureaucracy or time-wasting. I voted in favour of this very technical measure, also because it was necessary to bring these regulations in line with the new comitology procedure. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted in favour of this resolution because it is always necessary to underline the fact that trade with our international partners must always take place in a context of respect for human rights.

 I voted for this report. The text lists many of the problems relating to the application of the rules on waste management. The references to respect for the principle of subsidiarity are quite correct, as – even more so – are the references to the major interests that see the Mafia and organised crime in general involved in waste disposal, especially in some regions. Everyone is monitoring the situation in Campania, but we must also underline that in Italy – especially in northern regions around the Po, but also in some cases in the South – there are instances of excellent management of the waste cycle, which can set an example for the whole of Europe. In order to achieve these results, it is very important that local citizens improve their selection of local politicians. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 As I already mentioned in yesterday’s debate, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Cutaș. However, I demand that the European Commission should act on this important vote and quickly exert all necessary pressure on the government of Uzbekistan to put paid to the use of children in the cotton harvest. Europe cannot enter into agreements with countries that act in such a way. Cotton is a very important raw material for the textiles industry in my Padania. However, we have to insist that it be harvested in accordance with human rights. Children should be in school, not working in fields. Matteo Salvini,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we will support this report and we thank the rapporteur for his work. I am the seventh or eighth person to take the floor to say the same thing. If the Commission really believes that what we debate in Parliament counts for something, it should take action tomorrow, not with a report, or a threat, or a proposal for a measure. If it is true, and here the whole House is saying the same thing, from left to right – that thousands of children are forcibly sent to work in the cotton fields (and I think that the evidence now proves that it is so), then we vote in favour of this report. Yet if, tomorrow morning, no practical action against the government of Uzbekistan is taken by the European Commission, it will mean that we have lost, and we have wasted our time here tonight, as well as helping to destroy the credibility of Parliament, the Commission and the European institutions, and that we have several hundred thousand children on our consciences. Children who, if the debate continues so slowly, will continue next year to do what they have been forced to do for decades. Therefore, we support this report. However, I hope that at eight, when the debate ends, and with tomorrow’s vote, the problem will not be shelved, and I hope that the Commission will act, today rather than tomorrow.

 I voted for this report. The rapporteur, Mr Sturdy, and the Committee on International Trade (INTA) have done excellent work. In any case, it is right to emphasise that certain states may raise barriers to legitimately protect their own economy and their own consumers. Of course, the text is lacking one important consideration which is that at some point, even the European Union might need to start protecting its own fabric of production rather than limiting itself to only requesting reductions in duties and the removal of non-tariff barriers. In my opinion, a real trade policy should not limit itself to this alone and should consider the interests of European small and medium-sized enterprises first and foremost. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I would like to explain my vote in favour of the report on the modernisation of customs, because this is an important and much-needed text that enables the Commission to postpone the entry into force of a regulation adopted in 2008 and slated for implementation in 2013. Our delegation would have preferred to purge the text of references to the non-preferential origin principle, which we do not support, has nothing to do with the text of the report, and which we will fight if it is put forward again during the debate on the legislative proposal.

 I would like to declare my vote in favour of Ms McClarkin’s report on the implementation of the Professional Qualifications Directive. There is no doubt that the ability to carry out one’s profession in all Member States is a significant feature of the internal market.

 The purpose of this text is to provide a right and necessary basis for guiding the Commission on consumer protection. It is a complex and important issue that thus requires further consideration in the future. The report has brought to light important principles such as the importance of the consumer’s role in developing EU policies and the dissatisfaction being shown by citizens, with increasing concerns over sectors such as finance and insurance. Mr Triantaphyllides’ report also includes important points on the need to bolster consumer protection in sectors which are currently growing quickly, such as e-commerce. That is why I voted in favour of this text. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I would like to express my vote in favour of Mr Creutzmann’s report. The online gambling market is in a state of continual growth and its turnover has now exceeded EUR 10 billion. For these reasons, the issue of protecting consumers, specifically those who are weaker and more at risk, is extremely delicate and important. At the same time, we must ensure that the revenue generated for Member States through taxation of online gambling is not curtailed by the worrying presence of illegal gambling games which, other than providing an opportunity to launder enormous sums of illegally obtained money, place less cautious consumers in grave danger. I believe that it is of fundamental importance to ensure that national regulators work in close collaboration with each other. Greater exchange of information across Europe could prevent cases whereby unregulated providers exploit regulatory gaps and play national regulatory bodies off against each other. For this reason, the Commission and the Member States should take immediate steps to protect European consumers from bogus providers. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for having made such a complex subject and report accessible to everyone. I welcome the document, as it invites the Commission to simplify and safeguard the different legal practices in the various Member States, as well as the refusal to introduce new rules for tenders below European thresholds. Furthermore, the report dedicates a lot of space to the protection of small and medium-sized enterprises in respect of their ability to access European contract tenders. Finally, I would like to underline that simplifying legislative procedures not only offers many advantages to local administrators; it also helps to eradicate the wasting of funds. I therefore invite the Commission to continue along this route towards improving legal clarity. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

I would like to explain my strong opposition to this report, not just for the specific topic discussed in the text – the mutual evaluation tool, in relation to which, despite the delays and inconsistencies, it is possible to discern some positive aspects – but to the Commission’s attitude to such a complex issue. Unfortunately, in fact, the report only examines a marginal part of the Services Directive that is of little importance. Meanwhile, it fails to address the serious problems that the directive is causing, such as the lack of consumer protection, the little autonomy left to local authorities, and the calling into question of small manufacturing operations on which entire families have depended for generations.

 I voted in favour of implementing the United Nations Protocol on arms trafficking, which has, in any case, already been ratified by Italy.

I feel duty-bound to vote in favour of renewing trade preferences with Balkan countries, including Serbia, that currently have a stabilisation and association agreement in place with the European Union. Firstly, I feel this way on the basis of the Commission’s favourable take on simplifying commercial agreements with countries, such as China, that do not have association agreements with the European Union and whose products often undermine our competitiveness. Secondly, the text on which we reached final agreement offers the possibility of limiting the damage that allowing access for these goods could cause to our market. Matteo Salvini,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a snapshot of a disaster: it talks about a strategy for Europe, but we see no strategy. It is a snapshot of a hopeless disaster. Thank you for the report, which offers no way out at all. Somebody will have to explain to me what the Commission’s farsightedness entails. The details put forward here actually portray a debacle of what Europe is not. The prevailing interests are those of certain Northern European countries that want to liberalise everything and trade, regardless of social dumping and the imbalances we have with our so-called partners, but without any interest or protection for our small and medium-sized enterprises. It is essentially British and German interests that are being defended both by the Commission and by the report. I smile when I see in the report that the Member States and the Commission are being urged to communicate better, since the people of the European Union are sick to death of globalisation because of the loss of productivity. If, in your view, we can solve things by communicating better, then we really have not understood where to go.Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Enlargement is a very complex question and should be analysed from all points of view, from economic considerations to geopolitical repercussions and potential social impact. Above all at a time of economic crisis I think that it is advisable to be as prudent as possible and to learn from the mistakes of the past. I do not share the rapporteur’s view that the EU should launch a campaign in favour of enlargement in the candidate countries, since I do not believe that enlargement has proved successful in all cases or that visa liberalisation has always proved beneficial.

 Italy applied for financial assistance from the EU Solidarity Fund following the series of earthquakes that struck on 20 May 2012. A heavy earthquake with a magnitude of 5.9 on the Richter scale affected wide parts of Northern Italy and caused severe damage in many towns and villages, in particular around the epicentre, mostly in the provinces of Modena and Ferrara in the region of Emilia-Romagna. On 29 May, a second strong earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 on the Richter scale occurred with the epicentre slightly to the west. Both events were followed by several serious aftershocks. The earthquakes caused 27 deaths, an estimated 350 people were injured and over 45 000 people had to be evacuated. The Italian authorities estimated total damage at EUR 13 273 736 063. Despite the financial difficulties affecting the 2012 budget, I think it is necessary and right for Parliament to send a signal to the victims of these disasters to help them at this difficult time.

 I support the adoption of this trade Protocol between the EU and Israel, not just because Israel offers an interesting development opportunity to our enterprises in the fishery and agricultural sectors, but more particularly because I am opposed to exploiting trade relations with Israel for political ends. Bringing political pressure to bear in matters of trade on the one hand damages the interests of our enterprises and on the other gives an increasingly one-sided image of the EU in the Middle-Eastern conflict, undermining its credibility.

 The conflict between Israel and Hamas and other terrorist factions operating in Gaza is asymmetric. On the one hand there is a state that has the right and the duty, like any other state, to protect its citizens from the over 5 000 missiles and rockets launched since 2005, and on the other a terrorist organisation the aim of which is the destruction of the State of Israel, deliberately targeting civilians in order to terrorise the population. The situation is even more worrying if we consider the military and financial support provided by Iran to Hamas and the ambiguous role played by the new Egypt, in which the Muslim Brotherhood is increasingly influential. To forget these facts and turn the victim into the aggressor is not only to encourage extremism but also to allow extremists to voice the claims of the Palestinian people. It is unrealistic to believe that peace can be achieved with Hamas. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I support Mr Bové’s report on promoting the tastes of Europe. Farmers, and especially small-scale farmers, increasingly need aid and legal instruments to cope with global competition in agricultural markets both within the EU and internationally. I think the policy to promote local markets through the development of products with low food miles and information about origin and quality is particularly important for guaranteeing better incomes for farmers. This approach could prove particularly important in mountainous areas where in-quota agriculture is one of the most important ways of preventing the abandonment and degradation of the land and the environment.

 I agree with Ms Costa’s motion on protecting children in the digital world. It has been calculated that children spend up to 40 hours a week in front of the television and are online for 88 minutes a day.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ‘obscenity’ is the Taliban’s accusation against the 14-year-old Malala, who asked to go to school and for the right to education for girls in Pakistan, and the accusation of obscenity is the excuse to strike Malala down with two shots from a firearm, one to the head and the other to the shoulder. The Taliban’s attack not only has religious or political motivations, but aims to suppress and wipe out fundamental human rights and deny women dignity and the right to education. Such is the culture and lifestyle model the Taliban propose to the Muslim world, with utter contempt for their own lives and the lives of others. We obviously condemn these cowardly and cruel acts, but we would like ‘moderate’ Islam as a whole to raise its voice with us, to condemn these criminals.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again when we discuss relations between the EU and Israel, this House has divided along ideological lines and dragged a technical agreement into the area of political opposition, ignoring its content. The agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) is not an upgrading of relations between the EU and Israel; this is not an international legal measure defining frontiers and establishing rights of sovereignty. The legal services of Parliament and the Commission have approved it, underlining that the ACAA with Israel does not go beyond the existing legal framework. This is a technical agreement that will allow many European citizens easier access to quality medicinal products at a lower price, with considerable savings for our national health services. Italy will save about EUR 1 billion annually, a considerable sum in these difficult economic times. I therefore think that this agreement should be supported. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Under the Geneva agreement, Russia too has accepted the need for a compromise based on a transition process agreed by the government and by the rebels, whereby the opposition and Mr Assad’s regime would have to share power. At this point it is important to ensure opposition unity on a shared political platform, at least on some key points. We must avoid the Balkanisation of the conflict and its degeneration into combat between ethnic or religious groups. The future must bring a secular, democratic and tolerant Syrian society. Unfortunately, however, there has been recent news of attacks on the Christian community, which fuels fears of possible persecution by a new theocratic and Islamic fundamentalist regime in Syria. Europe must do everything it can to ensure that what happens in Egypt with the Coptic Christian community or in Libya between the various clans also happens in Syria. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have said, this is a protocol of a technical nature relating to the production of pharmaceutical products, and has already been negotiated by the Commission and approved by the Council in 2010. It cannot be considered as an upgrade of relations with Israel, as Baroness Ashton declared here in Parliament. The Commission has also stated that no changes are needed to this agreement and, moreover, the high quality of the medicinal products involved and the economic benefits for national health care systems have been confirmed. The Italian health care system, for example, would save millions of euro in patient care costs. My conviction is that in fact, opposition to this agreement is of a purely political nature, with the aim of boycotting Israel. Those who oppose this agreement for political reasons should therefore also oppose trade agreements with China, which is occupying Tibet, with Russia, occupying part of Georgia, Armenia, occupying Nagorno-Karabakh, and with any states guilty of serious human rights violations, which amounts to two-thirds of humanity.

 The appointment of a European Representative for Human Rights is intended to increase the visibility of European policy in this area. Greater visibility also means greater accountability and the need to report regularly to Parliament on this especially sensitive subject. I support this initiative. Appointing a Special Representative for Human Rights will enable the EU human rights strategy and the associated action plan to be implemented more effectively, by formulating recommendations, by stepping up dialogue with third countries, international, regional and non-governmental organisations active in this sector, by fostering overall coherence in EU action on human rights, and by integrating this dimension across all areas of the Union’s external action.

 Many people would like to see a new role for European policy in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We all want Europe to promote more effective peace initiatives than have happened so far and to take on a political role more in tune with our financial commitments in the area. To achieve that in such a complicated and difficult situation, the European Union must be seen as credible and unbiased by both parties. Both the Palestinians and the Israelis must be convinced that the Union is only interested in peace and is not prejudiced against either side. Do we really think that the European Union can be regarded as a credible partner by Israel in light of the recent consensual positions reached by the Foreign Affairs Council last May, which totally ignored Israel’s legitimate security demands, surrounded as it is by hostile countries? At a time when the hopes raised by the Arab Spring are being dashed and we see Islamic extremism prevailing in the Maghreb countries, what security assurances can be given by the new Palestinian state if it comes into being, which, by the way, is what we all hope will happen?

Mr President, I will not repeat what has already been said on the territorial dispute and on the energy issue at the root of the conflict. The result is that an agreed separation between the two States, recognised by the international community, is degenerating into a large-scale armed conflict. Another tragic result is that in the Blue Nile region, controlled by the Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement, Sudan is blocking humanitarian aid destined for 200 000 people. As well as providing humanitarian aid, I would like to see Europe conducting a policy that is more committed to supporting the African Union, and not so much in opposition to the Chinese presence or influence in the area, but in order to strengthen pan-African politics and ensure that Africa belongs, a little more, to Africans.

 I would like to thank Ms de Sarnez for her in-depth and meticulous analysis of trade relations between the European Union and China. The results of indiscriminately opening the European market to Chinese goods are there for all to see: relocations and massive job losses in Europe; average annual Chinese growth of 9% while European countries suffer a serious recession; the impotence of European trade policy; and not forgetting that 83% of counterfeit goods seized at the EU’s external borders come from China.

 The economic crisis currently affecting Europe is so serious that it is necessary to take more decisive action to protect our industry and our small and medium-sized enterprises, especially when they are subject to dumping or other unfair conduct by operators in countries where there is no rule of law and the safeguarding of social and environmental rights is effectively non-existent. The fact that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has decided to accept a claim from China against the already rather unambitious anti-dumping regulation in force in Europe is, instead, a step in the other direction, which makes it harder to safeguard our businesses and our jobs. Therefore, I cannot agree with the content of this regulation, which could further compound the difficulties of our businesses. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 The Commission should not underestimate the importance of ‘regional airports’, which are distinct from ‘hub airports’ in that their function is mainly tied to the area in which they are located. Unfortunately, these airports are increasingly neglected by EU legislation and have been given secondary importance in recent proposals on the development of the EU transport network. I share Mr Bradbourn’s stance on the monopolisation of many regional airports by individual airlines and their isolation by the transport network. We need to block unfair practices, such as the ‘one bag’ rule imposed by airlines, which cuts passenger spending in airports by up to 70%, with repercussions on the local economies linked to regional airports.

 Mr Rinaldi’s report is very ambitious and gives us a chance to reflect on the effects – and also the causes – of the so-called ‘Arab Spring’. In contrast to the rapporteur, however, I think the view that has been set out is too optimistic and that many of the proposed measures are more pertinent to development cooperation than to international trade. The growing instability and increasingly extremist political trends which are increasingly being seen in countries such as Egypt and Libya prevent me from sharing in the overall feeling of confidence over the so-called ‘Arab Spring’ and the rather premature comparison, in my view, with the fall of the Berlin Wall. The ‘more for more’ principle should be at the heart of EU policy on Mediterranean countries and any increase in European contributions ought to be dependent on real reforms designed to bring about thoroughgoing democracy in these countries. Only then will we be able to discuss a possible review of tariff barriers. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, freedom of worship seems increasingly in danger and, in particular, cases of discrimination and persecution against Christians are becoming increasingly widespread in the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, recently in Nigeria, in South-East Asia, China, India, Pakistan and North Korea. In these countries, there are numerous cases of forced emigration, attacks and arson against places of worship and religious structures, torture and killings, kidnappings and forced conversions. Not less than 10% of Christians around the world, in other words, 200 million people, are minorities in their own countries and potential victims of discrimination. Religious freedom is a fundamental human right, as we all know, but both the European Union and international human rights organisations are, unfortunately, still not very effective at reporting violations and protecting this right. I therefore wish to reiterate the proposal already advanced on other occasions, to set up a specific, accurate, and annual report by the European Parliament to monitor the status of religious freedom in the world and strongly denounce violations where they exist.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what I hope we can do is draw up a thorough report on any violation of freedom of worship, wherever it occurs, and whatever religion is prevented from being upheld, practised or pursued by anyone in the world. Not a discriminatory report against any one religion, but a report that starts from acknowledging the growing number of attacks on Christians around the world, which are becoming more severe and more numerous, as I have already said. I believe, given that this Parliament regards the protection of human rights and of all human rights as fundamental, that the protection of religious rights is perhaps the most fundamental, since they are based not only on human needs but on morals, and therefore we must be united in defending them, and in doing so, we are consistent with the objectives of this Parliament and are consistent with the defence of human rights, which has repeatedly been hailed around the world as a victory for civilisation. I am sure you will be on my side, as I am on yours. Fiorello Provera,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Kosovo is a country with enormous structural problems, as highlighted by the report itself. Chronic and widespread corruption, a judicial system that does not respond to the needs of a democratic country, a highly inefficient public administration, a serious lack of media freedom, insufficient protection of minorities even as regards cultural and religious traditions. Furthermore, the economy is very weak and environmental protection is neglected. On top of all this, crime syndicates are widespread, trafficking arms, people and drugs, as verified by international investigations and reported by authoritative media organisations. In 2010, the Council of Europe also denounced the involvement of Prime Minister Thaçi in organ smuggling and other criminal activities. All of this shows that we are a long way from any suggestion of possible integration, even though we have a duty to accompany Kosovo in its social and democratic development.

 I know that the Council of Europe accusation mentions President Thaçi by name 27 times, and that this news was also reported by the BBC. I am not the courts and it is not up to me to verify any judicial accountability. However, the Council of Europe’s accusation is a very serious one, made by an authoritative council, which I think deserves some consideration. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I am against the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia joining the European Union in the immediate future. I agree with the rapporteur’s view that there has been some progress – in fact, important progress; you just have to look at the latest elections, the economic reforms and at the end of the Parliamentary boycott. However, I am puzzled at the idea of accession, because there is still too great a distance between the social and political institutions of this Balkan state and those of the EU Member States. The rushed accession of a country in which there is separation and mistrust between ethnic groups could create a breeding ground for tensions within the EU and slow down the process by which the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia moves towards becoming a pluralist society.

 I voted against this resolution, even if I agree with some of the conclusions contained in Ms Pack’s report. I am not convinced by the underlying theory, the concept that, despite the critical areas, the EU accession process of Bosnia and Herzegovina should take place without pause for thought. There are still too many question marks about the real authority of the Balkan state. There are too many concerns about the effective independence of the judicial system, which is an indispensable requirement for guaranteeing the rule of law. Finally, too many criticisms can be levelled at the country with regard to its economy. In order for the European Union to be a driver of growth and political stability, it is fundamental that there should be a certain level of convergence between Member States, and Bosnia and Herzegovina does not currently have this.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have seen, the persecutions and killings of Christians are continuing on a wide scale in Nigeria. The latest official data says that the Boko Haram armed group, which wants to convert the country to Islam, has killed 1 200 Christians in the last two years and forced 35 000 Christians to flee the country. However, in some Arab countries, too, like Egypt and Iraq, millions of Christians are discriminated against, even killed or forced into exile. There is a sort of growing religious racism against Christians that is being accepted almost with resignation or fatalism. In this situation, the international institutions, including Europe, and important political and religious figures must make their voices heard loud and strong and call upon governments to face their responsibilities. I should add that I would also like to see the so-called moderate Islamic citizens, who quite rightly reject extremism, join us in defending the rights of their Christian fellow citizens. To return to Nigeria, we have mentioned the widespread poverty, the high levels of poverty of so many millions of people in this extraordinarily rich country that could so easily provide amply for all its citizens. As Ms Sargentini says, there is a problem and that is corruption, which is so widespread and pervasive that it has altered the social structures of the country. With corruption, there is no respect for the environment, no free market, no opportunities for trade or young people, and therefore, ultimately, there is no democracy either. In actual fact, Nigeria needs a proper, qualified, extremely honest ruling class, and without this, it cannot really be considered a modern country or a democratic country. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I am in favour of many of the ideas proposed by Mr Saryusz-Wolski on the issue of relations with the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa): the idea that the EU should have its own global, comprehensive approach on the issue; the idea that the growing role of emerging countries, in particular, the BRICS, should be fully acknowledged within the framework of rules and values, above all, those enshrined in the United Nations Charter; the idea that parliamentary diplomacy can contribute decisively to the development of amicable relations, especially in those countries in which parliamentarianism is becoming established; lastly, the idea that developing full political relations with the emerging world must not disregard crucial issues such as the environment, human rights and labour conditions. By contrast, I have great doubts about the request for visa liberalisation with Brazil. Migratory dynamics are too complicated to be addressed by immediately opening up our borders, particularly at a time of economic crisis such as we are currently experiencing. It is for this reason that I decided to abstain from the vote on this report. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I agree with and support the conclusions in Mr Watson’s report. The EU is now the world’s biggest market and the largest donor of development aid. It represents a unique opportunity for promoting human rights and respect for the rules of peaceful coexistence of the community of Member States. Unfortunately, thus far, the cumbersome red tape surrounding the EU’s restrictive measures against regimes that do not respect international law, and the failure of such measures to feed into one another, have meant that they have not always had the desired effect as deterrents and sanctions. It is unjust that sometimes, peoples that are already oppressed or European companies and citizens should have suffered the consequences of sanctions, while the corrupt, violent local elites have managed to evade them. In the same way, it is equally unjust that third countries take and have taken advantage of European respect for the rule of law and fundamental rights. I therefore join Mr Watson in calling for the Council to adopt, as soon as possible, clear rules – to be applied uniformly and subject to periodic review – that will enable the restrictive measures to be more effective.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, the Arab Spring has led not only to political changes but also to new challenges and threats to stability. One of these is the growing phenomenon of arms smuggling. Since the fall of Gaddafi in Libya, the Egyptian authorities have been reporting a sharp increase in arms smuggling in the Sinai Peninsula. Surface-to-air missiles, rockets and anti-aircraft guns have been stolen from army barracks abandoned by Libyan forces and now supply a black market for weapons, destined for the Gaza Strip and Hamas in particular. This is a very worrying phenomenon because these arms are capable of shooting down civilian aircraft during take-off and landing and may end up in the hands of terrorist groups such as Al-Qaida, for example in the Maghreb. How, I ask, can we help to mitigate this growing threat and who are our potential allies? Fiorello Provera

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, it is difficult to be optimistic. If Tehran were to have nuclear weapons, it would seriously destabilise the area between the Mediterranean and the Caucasus and could trigger a nuclear arms race in neighbouring countries that for various reasons are afraid of Tehran, such as Saudi Arabia or Turkey. The latest Iranian Shahab-3 missiles can reach EU Member States such as Greece, Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria, and would make the Tehran regime’s threat to destroy the State of Israel possible. A nuclear Iran really could block the Strait of Hormuz, making any political or military countermeasures extremely risky. We cannot afford a new North Korea in the Middle East. The new sanctions imposed by Europe are certainly a positive step, but time is running out to find a diplomatic solution to this crisis and avoid the military option. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 The agreement signed with Georgia is an important step for the recognition of the quality of our products abroad. It is tangible proof of the fact that partnership agreements can be the driving force behind the protection of geographical indications. For these reasons, I share in the Committee on International Trade’s unanimous approval of Mr Moreira’s report. If the Commission could manage to strike more agreements like this one – perhaps with countries whose brand culture is not yet like our own – that would be of huge benefit to foreign consumers and European producers.

I agree with, and strongly support, the conclusions of Mr Patriciello on the European space strategy, in their expression both of appreciation and of concern. There is no doubt that space policy is a great opportunity for Europe because it stimulates technological innovation, because it helps to make European citizens more secure, because it creates synergies in a strategic civil and military sector, and, finally, because it creates jobs for highly qualified workers. It is therefore right that the project should play a key role in the Europe 2020 strategy. That said, it is all too plain that in terms of governance, the Commission could and should have drawn up a more ambitious plan. The failure to include it in the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020 risks undermining the investments made so far. The references to cooperation with the United States, Russia and emerging powers are too weak to frame the space policy in an international context. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I support the balanced report by Mr Cutaş. Strengthening relations between Europe and Uzbekistan is a pivotal element of our partnership with the countries of Central Asia. Furthermore, the European textiles industry, which has considerable expertise in processing raw materials, can only benefit from free trade with the world’s third biggest cotton exporter and fifth-largest producer of cotton. However, especially in the textiles industry, closer cooperation must not fail to take into account respect for human rights and for children. As the EU Presidency acknowledged in June, during the cotton harvest the Uzbekistan government uses between 200 000 and 2 million children as a source of labour, closing the schools and dismissing teachers who refuse to send their pupils to work in the plantations. This fact is a serious cause for concern. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

) With the end of the Cold War Central Asia became increasingly important on the international stage, and its importance is destined to become even greater if, as seems probable, relations between East and West continue to intensify in the next few decades. The success of our strategy therefore has a key role in maintaining stable and fruitful relations with countries in Central Asia. Unfortunately, the conclusions of the report by Ms Kiil-Nielsen appear to suggest that Europe is not moving in the right direction. Progress has certainly been made, but not enough for those who wish to establish a long-lasting partnership: we provide limited economic support to these countries; corruption is rife in their political regimes; and there is insufficient respect for fundamental rights, with systematic cases of torture, repression of political opposition and child labour. Finally, as the report points out, dangerous movements with links to Islamic fundamentalism are spreading in the area. For these reasons I voted against the report. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I am opposed to the conclusion of the agreement with Morocco as it will be beneficial neither for Moroccan fishermen nor for European taxpayers. It will not benefit Moroccan fishermen because it will not create new jobs and it will increase the imbalance that already exists between the local fleet and the fishery potential. It will not benefit European taxpayers because they will spend EUR 13.5 million on subsidising the Moroccan fisheries policy without a guarantee that the money will be used in a worthwhile manner. Furthermore, for every euro invested European taxpayers will only gain back EUR 0.65, which is less than half of the average amount generated by similar agreements. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I fully support the conclusions contained in Mr Lisek’s report. The defence sector is undoubtedly one of those most severely affected by the austerity policies implemented as a result of the economic crisis. At this rate, Europe risks being unable to shoulder its international responsibilities and seeing some of its traditional areas of strategic weakness, such as duplication of military capabilities and its inability to carry out operations without US support, intensify. In order to prevent such a scenario from occurring, and to avoid draining funds from other important expenditure headings, the only effective solution, as the report indicates, is to move towards greater cooperation within the Union, with due respect for national prerogatives. This cooperation should cover all areas of defence but, in particular, contract liberalisation, technological research, coordination of planning and sharing of certain capabilities. Greater collaboration would, moreover, enable European countries to strengthen their own strategic autonomy and increase their political influence within the Atlantic Alliance. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

There are many points with which I agree in the report tabled by Mr Siwiec and Mr David: from its emphasis on trade, to the importance it attributes to cultural ties between the younger generations in neighbouring countries and Europe; however, I do not feel I can support it. I do not agree with some of the few conclusions on immigration. The proposal to undertake a rapid liberalisation of the visa regime, for example, seems to be a proposal that will cause hardship both to the indigenous populations and to the migrants, at least until the economic and social systems of Europe and neighbouring countries resemble each other. The same holds true for the idea of separating the issues of immigration and security, a key connection helping to prevent social tensions in poverty-stricken areas. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, throughout the world, obstacles, including legislative obstacles, are increasing against freedom of worship. The number of attacks and murders grow each year and affect practitioners of all religions, but Christians in particular. Paradoxically, religious freedom is becoming an increasingly uncertain issue rather than one of the most natural and indisputable freedoms. In Europe and in our Parliament, we constantly proclaim our defence of human rights, but our work to guarantee religious freedoms is still rather ineffective. That is why I am in favour of the proposal, which has been put forward on other occasions, to commission a specific, accurate and yearly report by Parliament to monitor the state of religious freedoms around the world. This report would provide the necessary facts to plan appropriate and preventive political action in line with what was expressed by the High Representative to organise policies which are country-specific in terms of the needs of the country itself.

 Iran continues to claim that it wants to develop a nuclear programme for civilian purposes. In fact, however, it has carried out research and set up facilities for military purposes, as verified in recent inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Its nuclear ambitions, which in themselves are worrying, are accompanied by a policy of internal repression and aggression towards other countries in the area, such as Saudi Arabia and particularly Israel. This threat has not only political and military repercussions but also economic and strategic ones, because it may affect oil production and thus have economic and financial consequences that would have a direct impact on us as well. A global threat needs a global response. It is therefore crucial to establish very close cooperation with the United States regarding all measures that may from time to time become necessary, such as imposing further, more incisive sanctions on Tehran. I hope it is not already too late. Fiorello Provera,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will talk about the area I know best, northern Italy. The most important issue for our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) at the moment is access to credit; it is far more important than excessive red tape, the tax burden or international competition, particularly from China. The banks are being forced to recapitalise and get rid of the debts caused by their financial speculation, and so they are not granting any more credit to SMEs, which are too small to have their own capital resources or to provide guarantees. Small businesses are therefore unable to contribute to the country’s economic recovery, even if they are willing to do so. It is therefore essential to expand credit schemes of various kinds in favour of SMEs and to improve information about the availability of the financial instruments at their disposal, the Structural Funds in particular. Without money, there is no research, no equipment renewal and no possibility of investing, and therefore it is impossible to contribute to the country’s wellbeing. Fiorello Provera,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the massacre in Egypt to prevent a demonstration to protest against the burning of a Coptic church by Salafi Muslims shows how far it still is from democracy. Quite apart from the difficulties faced by the Copts when they request authorisation to build a church, according to a law dating back to the Ottoman Empire, there are an increasing number of attacks on Christians by Muslim extremists. The protests, instead of being guaranteed by the military authorities in power in Egypt, are being repressed with bloodshed. Paradoxically, these religious conflicts and these repressions were less frequent at the time of President Mubarak. But there are other worrying signs which are disappointing for the expectations of the so-called Arab Spring. I am referring to the attack on the Israeli embassy and the subsequent withdrawal of the ambassador, the attacks on the gas pipelines in the Sinai, the requests by some political parties to revise the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel and, finally, the huge advances being made by Islamist parties. Since the EU has rightly strengthened its political and financial support for Egypt, would it not be appropriate to apply the Füle-Ashton doctrine of ‘more for more’, and therefore also of ‘less for less’, by directing aid to those political, social and trade union organisations that promote democracy and stability in Egypt?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Eastern partnership is an important political dimension for the European Union, but the obstacles to its future development are currently rather concerning. Dialogue with Belarus remains difficult, while in Ukraine, the Tymoshenko case confirms a relapse on respect for human rights as well as rampant corruption. Parts of Georgia and Azerbaijan are under military occupation and the tension between Azerbaijan and Armenia is increasing, with a risk of ensuing armed conflict. Without losing hope on the future of the Eastern partnership, we must remind these six partner countries of their responsibilities: respect for the fundamental rules of democracy and the resolution of territorial conflicts. Here, I am referring in particular to Nagorno-Karabakh and to Georgia. Europe cannot accept violations of international law guaranteeing territorial integrity as, moreover, this House has already appealed for in its resolution on the South Caucasus, and we cannot repudiate our basic principles on respect for human rights.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in a statement on 5 October Commissioners Füle and Malmström expressed their satisfaction with the outcome of discussions with Tripoli on a cooperation agenda which included the management of migration flows, border management, pan-African policy and international protection for refugees and asylum seekers. This ambitious agenda came to an end for the reasons we know – NATO’s military intervention and the change of regime in Tripoli. I believe that the first objective is to resume cooperation with Libya as soon as possible on these major issues – border management, migration flows, energy supplies and the fight against terrorism. That said, another equally important issue is to support Libya’s new leadership in organising free elections as the first step in a long process that will, I hope, one day make it possible to build a truly democratic and stable country. Building a democracy is much more difficult than winning a war, especially if there is no previous memory of democracy in the country. I wanted to know what practical plans can be put in place in the short term to take action within civil society, especially in culture and education, which are key elements for building a true democracy in people’s hearts and minds.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is convinced that it is both opportune and necessary to create two states which can live together and in peace. The difference of opinion merely lies in understanding how to achieve these goals. The Palestinian Authority’s intention of unilaterally applying to the United Nations for recognition as a state is an initiative which, in my opinion, could harm the peace process and spark off chain reactions in the Middle East. There is clearly an intention to isolate Israel in a diplomatic sense and to present it with a fait accompli
, right at a time when the peace agreements with Egypt are threatened by extremist positions and relations with Turkey are in crisis. The episode of the attack on the Israeli embassy in Cairo is the latest link in this chain. The unilateral initiative by the Palestinians is in conflict with the principle shared by both parties, according to which the only solution to the conflict is bilateral negotiations between the parties. Unilateral recognition could therefore create further instability and make it even more difficult to build a democratic Palestinian state that could live in peace with Israel. I therefore hope that there will be a return to the key principles of the Oslo Accords, based on mutual recognition, peaceful coexistence, security and political rights. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I would like to thank Mrs De Keyser for having wished to develop some points from the report on migration flows arising from instability, which was recently adopted by the European Parliament. In particular, the report insists on the importance of a global, coherent approach based on targeted strategies relating to development, human rights, good governance, social inclusion and promotion of women’s and minority rights in order to promote democracy.

 Although 156 countries have now signed the Ottawa Convention on the prohibition of the use of mines, some 37 countries have still not signed.

 I fully support this report by Mrs Tzavela. The development of broadband can, in fact, be useful for economic recovery, for the support that it guarantees to innovation and the possibility of making transactions faster and simpler. The implementation of high-speed broadband networks in Europe is extremely important for the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.

 Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the Nagorno-Karabakh issue is little known and often by means of biased information, but a clear point, which is indisputable and, I would say, fundamental, is the principle of territorial integrity of a sovereign state. The inviolability of borders must be respected: this is the case in Georgia, Moldova, Cyprus and so in Azerbaijan. There have been numerous positions adopted on the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and the following have been pointed out: the 2008 Helsinki declaration, four United Nations Security Council resolutions and even our Parliament has given its views on this issue. The territorial integrity of a sovereign state is guaranteed by international law and questioning this principle means encouraging future military attacks and attempts to change the international status quo, with destabilising consequences for the whole world. Europe has a particular interest in resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh issue because Armenia and Azerbaijan fall within the scope of the Eastern Partnership project which expressly provides for stability and collaboration between partner countries. We should therefore work towards this. Lastly, I would point out that time consolidates Armenia’s position in the occupied territories and this makes an agreement more difficult and the situation in the area riskier.

 Without a legally binding global international agreement under which the other industrialised nations undertake to make equivalent commitments and emerging countries undertake to make suitable efforts, there are not sufficient grounds for a unilateral increase in the EU emissions reduction target for 2020. It is too early to recognise the Commission’s evaluation of a possible 25% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels, should the EU objective of increasing energy efficiency be met (20% increase by 2020). Before proceeding along these lines a careful examination is required, along with a thorough investigation of the implications in terms of costs. Within the framework of international climate negotiations, recognition of this result at this stage does not seem appropriate, because in the eyes of the other parties it detracts from the unilateral commitment already made by the European Union (-20% by 2020). It is also too early to recognise the milestones identified on the roadmap, before carrying out the necessary investigations for evaluating the implications for Member States. In view of these considerations, I voted against the report. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Europe is characterised by great territorial diversity and polycentric development. In this context, Europe’s cities represent centres of economic activity, innovation and employment, but they must face up to a number of challenges.

This new approach will also be relevant to mountain regions which could similarly play a leading role in realising the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.

 Economic, social and territorial cohesion are fundamental principles in determining all EU policies and activities. I share the rapporteur’s view that the economic crisis will force us to be more innovative and to seek a bigger impact from the available funding. Innovation means creating synergies and an integrated approach between the different sectoral policies in order to achieve the optimal result for growth and development on the ground. I particularly agree with the rapporteur’s assertion that synergies and coordination do not imply one-size-fits-all solutions, but call for close strategic coordination between instruments, policies and actors in order to produce carefully designed interventions and programmes which take into account the territorial specificities and comparative advantages or special features of each region in an integrated place-based approach.

 In a large internal market like Europe’s, there is a need to ensure that consumers’ rights are protected. Mr Schwab’s report has the aim of merging four different directives: those on off-premises sales, on distance sales, on guarantees and on unfair contract terms. It is difficult to reconcile 27 different legal traditions on these subjects. This is probably not the most appropriate point in history to issue regulations of this complexity. It would have been more opportune, in my view, to concentrate on specific aspects and sectors, rather than to try and create a new competency shared between the EU and the Member States. In fact, for certain states, this directive will represent an over-large and over-enthusiastic step forward, while other countries will have to make concessions in the name of European harmonisation. For this reason, although I acknowledge the great effort made by Mr Schwab, I cannot vote in favour of this report. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 This directive is designed to ensure that Member States establish a national regulatory and organisational framework and draw up appropriate national programmes for spent fuel and radioactive waste management, regardless of the perspectives of nuclear power and non-power applications. The Commission’s position is commendable: it makes the Member States responsible for the safe management, including disposal, of the spent fuel and radioactive waste that they generate, through the development of their own programmes. On the other hand, many of the amendments incorporated in the text are questionable. On such a sensitive issue as this, maximum transparency and public information are crucial. However, choices of this kind cannot be restricted to public participation in decision-making alone. In fact, the danger of not laying down precise rules is that we will fail to take the decisions necessary to ensure the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste. For this reason I cannot support this report. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have seen that no country can face the problem of immigration alone. It is essential to have a policy governing large migration movements that supports development cooperation and provides for multilateral and bilateral agreements with the migrants’ countries of origin and of transit. Unfortunately, the new European external action instruments have not been used in the spirit or with the vision of the Treaties, as Italy is now finding. The front-line Member States have in fact had to face the refugee crisis by means of unilateral initiatives, without being able to rely on European solidarity. I therefore call on the Commission to define the cases in which we can talk of a ‘mass influx of displaced persons’ under the terms of Directive 2001/55/EC on temporary protection, thereby setting precise, measurable criteria that can be regarded as permanent. Such clarification is important for promoting an effective common policy on migration and ensuring that the burden is shared. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

The Balkan region is one of the most sensitive areas of the EU’s external borders in terms of illegal migration. This phenomenon is of great significance and has repercussions on the daily lives of many of our citizens, exacerbating the insecurity they face. Before being able to think about the possible admittance of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area, special and detailed plans must be drawn up to contain migratory pressures. In addition, improving controls at external borders must be combined with fighting the corruption of local authorities. I voted against this measure for the reasons stated and to better protect our citizens against illegal immigration. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Through this measure, we are at last able to express our desire to improve the work of rating agencies by enhancing their transparency, integrity, responsibility, independence and reliability. While recognising the role of agencies in supplying information and stimulating market liquidity, it is now quite clear that financial operators have placed too much faith in their judgments and that their actions contributed to causing the financial crisis. There is too much dependence on external credit rating agencies and an oligopoly exists in the sector. I am therefore in favour of establishing an independent European Credit Rating Foundation with responsibility for ratings in the public sector, for companies and for structured finance instruments.

European legislation is too often complex, difficult to understand and difficult to apply. This is why impact assessments can make a significant contribution to improving the quality of EU law making, particularly in terms of reducing the timescales and costs of the legislative process. I support this measure because, by taking the requirements of Member States into greater consideration, it will be possible to evaluate the possible social, environmental, financial and economic consequences of a legal act. Impact assessments should also be completely independent and transparent and be carried out in the early stages of the legislative process. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 The Galileo system will improve the accuracy and the reliability of US Global Positioning System (GPS) information. This new system will be important for ensuring Europe’s autonomy and independence from other global navigation systems and enabling it to claim a share of this booming worldwide high-tech market. As we know, the programme is funded fully by the Union budget with a budget of EUR 3.4 billion until 2014. We know that the indirect benefits of the programme are estimated to be around EUR 60 billion per year, but the Commission has admitted that additional investment will be required in order to reach full operational capacity. As it is not clear how much the Galileo system will cost the taxpayer, I abstained on this measure, not least to reiterate the request to the Commission to clarify the project’s future costs.

 Mr President, the dialogue between the European Union and Russia must be expanded as much as possible in various areas, from the economy to human rights, because there are no alternatives to dialogue. Europe and Russia are, in fact, interdependent, both economically and politically. I am thinking of unresolved international issues such as energy security, the Maghreb, Iran’s nuclear capability, terrorism, the Caucasus, Nagorno-Karabakh, climate change and others. Russia is a strategic partner for Europe, not least because of the synergies that may be built in future. As already happens to some extent, Moscow can supply us with mineral and energy resources as well as collaborate on military security and the fight against terrorism and organised crime Europe can contribute with financial resources, scientific and technological capabilities and our long-standing experience in the field of democracy and human rights. Russia’s future is linked to Europe’s and must be developed with perseverance, without complacency and despite the many difficulties that currently exist. In that respect, the conclusion of the strategic partnership agreement between the European Union and Russia is of great importance for our common future. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Croatia asked to join the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in 2005. Since this country is on one of the main drug smuggling routes into the European Union, I consider it important to have factual, objective information from Croatia on these problems.

Sudan, the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa, is a crossroads between the Arab and African worlds, as well as a mosaic of many heterogeneous ethnic groups. It has seen numerous conflicts since its independence from the United Kingdom in 1956. With the signing of the Naivasha Agreement and the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) (2005), 20 years of conflict between the north and south formally came to an end. In January 2011, as provided for in the CPA, a referendum marked the last leg of the road towards the independence of the south from northern Sudan. In this extremely delicate transition phase, we must keep a balanced approach to both north and south, with particular attention to the needs of the south regarding institution building and governance. The aid given by the EU to South Sudan must be measured in terms of the effective capability of this new state to absorb it. Indeed, we must ensure that future flows of funding to Juba do not end up being used inappropriately or, worse, adding to the already widespread corruption. Europe should also increase its commitment to protect the Christian minorities in the north of the country, who are increasingly the targets of persecution and discrimination. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Azerbaijan actively participates in the European Neighbourhood Policy, is one of the EU’s six Eastern partners, and is among the founders of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly. The core values of these three initiatives are respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law. These initiatives are intended to foster a continuous political dialogue that can deepen ties between member countries and enable Europe to accompany them along the path to reform. We believe that the instrument of the emergency resolution may be inadequate or even counterproductive to the achievement of the desired goal, namely, Azerbaijan steadily progressing towards its objectives of full and modern democracy. The institutions set up under the agreements reached at interparliamentary and intergovernmental level are intended to achieve these ends; these are the right place to demand explanations for possible infringements of rights and effectively encourage good behaviour and democratic reforms.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the attacks on Coptic churches in Egypt and the killing of Christians are signs that religious intolerance is worsening, betraying the spirit of unity shown in Tahrir Square, where Copts and Muslims demonstrated together against the regime. Coexistence and social stability are essential for an orderly transition to democracy, but they are made impossible by this lack of tolerance. The authorities in Cairo must therefore make a greater commitment to protect minorities and to oppose Salafi extremism, which is a negation of the principles of modern democracy to which the Egyptian people aspire. Economic development, with the resumption of foreign investment and, above all, tourism, is unthinkable without tolerance, order and stability. It is therefore in the interests of Egypt and the world that Europe should grant generous aid, but this aid must be conditional upon an effective policy to protect minorities, in line with the ‘more for more’ principle that you, Baroness Ashton, proposed together with Commissioner Füle.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to Bahrain. This little country lies in a strategic position in terms of the balance of the Gulf and energy supply distribution. The presence of a major oil refinery for Saudi crude is well known. I would like to draw your attention to one aspect of this situation which seems particularly worrying to me. Reliable sources have identified Iranian influence on the Shi’ite population of Bahrain. This is in addition to the legitimate aspirations for more substantial reforms in the government of that country. It is difficult to determine how much weight outside influence has had on the recent events in Bahrain, but there is a risk of destabilisation of the region that could extend to eastern regions of Saudi Arabia, home to another large group of Shi’ites. Iran funds Hamas, supports Hezbollah in Lebanon and influences the internal politics of Iraq, where Shi’ite Islam is the predominant component of the government. If the disruption of balance spread to the Gulf, the impact would be obvious and there could be global repercussions. We must be very careful in assessing what happens in the Middle East and distinguish the legitimate aspirations of peoples for greater democracy from external influences which have strategic ambitions in the area.

When we review the European Neighbourhood Policy, it is important to assess the impact of this policy on migration. No Neighbourhood Policy can be fully effective in this area without tackling the causes of instability that trigger migration. This entails regional cooperation, potentially via bilateral agreements, with both the countries of origin and with transit countries. We must cooperate with transit countries and with countries of origin for migration so as to prevent surges. We must help the migrants’ countries of origin to democratise and attain good governance by giving them access to our values and our experience. With regard to the European Neighbourhood Policy, we need an economic agenda which can increase levels of employment and trade agreements that can generate real, market-driven, economic development. Commissioner Füle and High Representative Ashton support, with the ‘more for more’ formula, the concept of conditions for aid which aim to reward the countries most active in terms of democratic reforms and respect for human rights. This approach should be encouraged, as it is consistent with our values, effective for development, and does right by European taxpayers. Fiorello Provera,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this tragically topical own-initiative report was first drawn up more than a year ago to assess the phenomenon of immigration and its structural causes in a pragmatic and balanced manner, regardless of political or ideological prejudices. We wanted to investigate the role of foreign policy and its ability to have an effect on the deep-seated causes of immigration, beyond humanitarian or emergency causes. Wars, ethnic tensions, persistent climate change, human rights violations, a lack of civil and economic liberties, endemic corruption, a lack of institutional representatives of citizens’ needs, such as trade unions, associations, political parties: the set of all these elements represents the field of deployment of European foreign policy and resolving these problems will remove many of the reasons that cause millions of people to emigrate. No development cooperation policy can be fully effective without tackling the causes of instability in migrants’ countries of origin. This involves regional cooperation with both with the country of origin and the country of transit, including through bilateral agreements. The Millennium Development Goals are already very ambitious, but certainly will not be achieved without political stability and without implementing effective mechanisms for preventing conflicts and maintaining peace. The global reach of this policy and its holistic approach require clear ideas and substantial financial resources that are difficult to come by in this moment of crisis. It is therefore advisable to coordinate the actions of the Union with those of other major powers such as the United States to avoid duplication of funding in the same areas or dispersal of financial resources, as has often happened in the past. A global phenomenon must be dealt with by a global policy. We must lead the migrants’ countries of origin to democracy and good governance by making available our values and our experience. Under the European Neighbourhood Policy, we should offer an economic agenda that can increase levels of employment and trade agreements that can generate real economic development consistent with market laws. Commissioner Füle and the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, drew attention, with the slogan ‘more for more’, to the concept of conditionality of aid which aims to reward countries that are most actively setting out on the road to democratic reforms and respect for human rights. This is consistent with our European values, effective for development and – if you will allow me – morally fair to taxpayers. I would like to conclude by stating that a European policy for the management of large migration flows should go hand in hand with acceptance of the concept of ‘burden sharing’, in line with the duty of State solidarity under Article 80 of the Treaty, because no country can face up to an emergency of enormous proportions by itself. Finally, I thank Commissioner Malmström for her support for some or many points in this report, and I hope that Europe can actually work with Italy to address a phenomenon that has an international dimension and that affects every one of us. Fiorello Provera,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, before I come to the report, I would like to respond to Mr Meyer and Mr Tavares. I really respect the opinions of everyone, but it seems to me that their views on Lampedusa and what is happening in Lampedusa are hardly generous. I wanted to inform them that 12 000 people arrived in Lampedusa within the space of three nights. Lampedusa is a small island with 6 000 inhabitants and 12 000 people arrived suddenly in three nights, increasing the population to 20 000. I think it is very difficult for any country to accept such a large number of people arriving in such a short space of time on a small island which has no facilities for such a great number of arrivals. There are currently 1 400 migrants on Lampedusa. Much has been done, and as soon as sea conditions permitted, the migrants were transferred to other centres, primarily in the south of the country. This brings us to the report. I wanted to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the different political parties who, with their different sensibilities, have contributed very effectively to this report. They made a fundamental contribution, in absolute transparency, in the same spirit that inspired us all at the beginning. I also thank Commissioner Malmström for the enthusiasm she has shown for the concept of burden sharing, which should influence her work within the Commission and thus within Council. If she continues to show the same enthusiasm, I think the results will follow. I end by saying that the situation is very difficult to sum up. Insofar as a summing up is possible, I would like to say that any policy will be ineffective and incomplete as long as huge differences persist between the levels of development in the North and South of the world, as long as huge differences persist in the quality of democratic institutions, and as long as there are vast differences in respect for human rights. We must take action as part of a major policy of strategic cooperation and aid that will have an impact on the structural causes that led to these huge inequalities between North and South. If we solve those structural causes, the rest will follow and the world we all live in will probably be a better place. Fiorello Provera,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I also wish to express my sympathy and admiration for the dignity, fortitude and cohesion demonstrated by the Japanese people in the face of the sort of catastrophe that the world has rarely seen in terms of size and severity. The behaviour of the Japanese people is truly an inspiration to all and they deserve our help. The lesson to be learned from this experience is the need to strengthen the European civil protection system through more closely coordinated action and the wider availability of people and resources so that we can act quickly in the event of disaster. With regard to the nuclear option, it would be a mistake to discuss this topic on the emotional tide of current events: the subject is too important and must be addressed with a scientific approach. It is absolutely right to strengthen security measures for present and next-generation power stations and to dismantle those that are older and more unsafe, but we must avoid political exploitation and be cautious and pragmatic, as Mr Brok said. We should remember that in the same Fukushima area, a dam collapsed during the earthquake with many casualties, but this does not lead us to think of dismantling dams or building new ones, hence I call for caution, attention and openness to the future.

 Through this report, Parliament has highlighted important issues that deserve to be emphasised in terms of the growth of European industry. I am referring to the recognition of the strategic role of small and medium-sized enterprises and to the need to make it easier to access credit with simplified funding procedures, as well as the importance of internationalisation as a key factor for competitiveness. The link between innovation and the industrial world through continuous relations between enterprises and universities is also crucial and includes the sale of results and encouraging their use. For this reason, I support the contents and the proposals of the report by Mr Lange. Fiorello Provera,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Belder on his excellent work. Whilst the world is watching the revolt in the Arab world, Iran continues to repress dissidents. The arrest of the two leaders of the opposition, Mr Mousavi and Mr Karoubi, is the most obvious proof of this. The West took action against Mr Gaddafi, but it continues to dither over Iran, perhaps because Mr Gaddafi has already fallen whilst Mr Ahmadinejad so far has not. The largest rebellion since the post-electoral revolts of 2009 is currently under way in Iran. What are we waiting for before we freeze all the assets held by Mr Ahmadinejad, the companies controlled by the revolutionary guard and all supporters of the regime who are involved in this repression? What are we waiting for in order to impose travel restrictions on these figures of the regime? Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is the principal financial backer of the Palestinian Authority, providing it with around EUR 1 billion per year, and yet Europe’s political role in the peace process remains marginal. This large-scale financial assistance gives us the right to ask the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to return to the negotiating table. On the issue of the recognition of Palestine, we must be clear. The problem of peaceful coexistence with Israel will not be resolved through unilateral recognition of the Palestinian State, which, moreover, still has not been self-proclaimed. The PNA must instead go back to taking an active role, sit down at the negotiating table and resolve the ongoing disputes, particularly over safe borders, on the status of Jerusalem and on the issue of refugees. Even a partial agreement would strengthen the moderate sections of both sides and reduce the influence of extremism. Fiorello Provera,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fall of President Mubarak has paved the way for democracy, but it is also a tremendous opportunity to liberate the Egyptian people. The reform of the country’s democratic institutions will allow for, amongst other things, further development of the economy and the possibility of spreading prosperity to all members of society, even the weakest. Without democracy, economic development will serve only to enrich a few families, as has always been the way in countries that have no social justice. European policy must therefore support Egypt as it embarks on reforms and help the Egyptian people to choose their own future unaided. On the other hand, we must be clear with the future government of Cairo and emphasise that a new and more generous partnership policy will be conditional upon regional security and peace with Israel.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to provide an immediate political response to these emergencies. The urgent interventions requested by Italy are: 1) the transformation of Frontex from a coordination agency to an operative structure with its own people and resources; 2) the implementation of the principle of burden sharing; 3) the use of Europol for investigations on possible terrorist infiltrations and criminal organisation of the traffic in human beings; and 4) the allocation of resources to deal with the emergency. In any case, none of this will resolve the structural causes of the revolutions in the Maghreb, which all arise from the lack of genuine political parties, trade unions, associations, a free press and, above all, lack of respect for human rights. In essence, the institutional tools that characterise true democracy and give the people a voice are missing. Without them, there cannot be economic development, jobs, stability and security for all. This is the real political challenge that Europe must face up to. Fiorello Provera,  
on behalf of the EFD Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the old order is changing in the Maghreb and this crisis raises a multitude of problems that will not be easy to solve. There are risks as well as hopes. It is possible that secular authoritarian regimes could be replaced by aggressive, destabilising Islamic fundamentalist theocracies. We should remember what happened in Iran: it is hard for democratic development to go hand-in-hand with revolution. There are certainly lessons to be learnt from Iran. Another danger is that the economic crisis in the area is likely to worsen, resulting in even greater youth unemployment and large influxes of migrants that Europe can no longer cope with. These events are a sign that our Euro-Mediterranean policy is inadequate and show that the cooperation policy implemented so far is not up to the task of creating the conditions for development and democracy. What has happened is not due solely to the economic crisis, even though it has been severe, but to the lack of social stability, in other words the lack of vehicles to represent the people’s interests, such as trade unions, a free press, political pluralism, a voluntary sector, the rule of law and equal opportunities for everyone. Supporting the countries of this region in their journey should be at the heart of Europe’s policy, alongside economic and trade assistance. This is the way to create true stability: not the stability provided by authoritarian regimes, but stability founded on social consensus, participation and democratic institutions.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Cesare Battisti is not a romantic hero as some have depicted him, but a savage murderer with a history of robbery who has been found guilty of killing four people with shots to the back of the neck. He benefited unjustly from Mr Mitterrand’s doctrine of political asylum and has been protected and idealised by some left-wing French intellectuals. Having fled to Brazil to avoid repatriation and prison, Mr Battisti was saved by President Lula due to an erroneous decision that was probably made for political reasons, with no regard for the suffering of the victims and their relatives. Mrs Figueiredo, Parliament’s request to the Brazilian authorities and to the Commission does not only ask for the respect of legal rules and bilateral agreements, but also aims to affirm the principle that no ideological reason can justify the actions of a murderer and no country may guarantee him impunity. We must never forget that there is ethical value in the moral compensation of victims by serving a punishment. This is at the foundation of the social contract that props up all communities that are civilised, or that aim to be. Giancarlo Scottà,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must thank Ms García Pérez for her long and patient work over the last year to reach an agreement that is as close as possible to Parliament’s position. The course of events started back in 2009 with our own-initiative report on quality products, which highlighted certain important issues on which we have achieved results today and others on which we still have work to do. The outcome we have secured is a success for all those producers, associations and cooperatives that have supported us over these years, and acknowledges their commitment to quality. The importance of their work is highlighted in this report, since the Member States are enabled to promote the establishment and operation of such groups. The positive outcomes obtained are due to the teamwork shown by Parliament’s delegation to the meetings with the other institutions. They include ex officio
 protection, whereby the Member States must protect products with quality marks, even where they are used as ingredients in processed products, without waiting for producers to make a complaint. In contrast to the measures introduced in Mr Nicholson’s report on contractual relations in the milk and milk products sector, production management for quality marks in other sectors has been left out of the report now being debated. It was simply not possible to reach agreement on production planning, a crucial issue for our producers. They wanted this instrument above all to make it possible to balance demand and supply. We will continue working alongside our fellow Members to achieve this outcome as well. Lastly I would like to thank the Italian associations that represent the cooperatives, which have worked with us and will continue to do so. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a substitute member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and a full member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I have had the occasion to work on this dossier. I have the impression that, on this issue, the Commission is not taking the real protagonists of the event – the breeders and the producers – into consideration. The aim of the proposals is to introduce a ban on voluntary labelling – a measure that is precisely not obligatory – which allows producers who choose to do so to provide additional information on the label. Since the same organisations representing breeders and producers have asked for this measure to continue to be provided, it is paradoxical not to concede this possibility. On the contrary, within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, work is being carried out in order that our farmers can provide data relating to the products that they sell in as transparent a way as possible. It therefore seems counterproductive to work, on the one hand, to protect the provision of information to consumers and make it transparent while, on the other hand, abolishing measures, voluntary measures even, that go in the same direction. It is clear that these are choices to be made if the intention is to lower the quality and the standards of agricultural products. There is no other explanation of a comparable measure against breeders committed to providing indications of quality, such as the choice of one type of feed rather than another. For these reasons, I will be voting against certain amendments. Giancarlo Scottà,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard and as has been said, I am concerned about what is happening in Syria, where the conflict is continuing with increasing loss of human life. Neither of the two sides can win via the military approach and the only possible solution is a political one, supported by the government and the opposition. Europe must work to this end. The dangers to avoid are a takeover by Islamic extremism or the Balkanisation of the country along ethnic and religious lines. I hope that Europe adopts a serious and practical stance – which, as we have already heard, it is working on – and I therefore hope for an excellent outcome to put an end to these civilian and military deaths, and everything else.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we have adopted today proposes the creation of a single working and services area for the maritime, mountain and lake areas of the Mediterranean basin, with the participation of national governments and, above all, local and regional authorities. This project rekindles the political ideal of a Europe of the regions, in line with the founding fathers’ original vision for Europe. To highlight the importance of macro-regions, I would like to highlight and bring to your attention an initiative that came about, in part, as a result of the work and ideas of my party’s representatives. It is the agreement to create the macro-region of the Alps, signed in St Gallen, Switzerland, on 29 June by regions belonging to France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria and Germany. The leaders of the three northern Italian regions of Veneto, Lombardy and Piedmont took part in the meeting. I hope this initiative will soon come to fruition, not least in this Chamber, thereby helping Europe evolve towards a genuine Europe of the people and of the regions. That is the only way to overcome the current financial crisis, to add value to our regions and their special quality products, to revive the economy in real terms, and to fully implement the principle of subsidiarity. That is why I voted for Mr Alfonsi’s report. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with my colleague’s report on rural development where it introduces some appreciable elements of simplification such as the reduction in the number of annual progress and summary reports. Under the heading of rural development is the change to the rules on using advisory services, which should help to reduce the administrative burden for Member States. I also agree with Mr De Castro on the need not to exclude support for producer associations in the fruit and vegetable sector, as part of measures to support the establishment and administration of producer associations. I also consider it essential, as the rapporteur stated, that Member States which have opted for regional programmes be allowed calculation of the automatic decommitment of financial resources at Member State level. I also agree with the position of Mr Capoulas Santos in his report on the system of financing by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, and I thank the other Members that I have not mentioned for their work.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Ms Paulsen for her report. I find it very odd that in such a prestigious House, where important decisions will be taken, there are still those who, in an ambiguous, anachronistic spirit of animal welfare, waste precious time and cost all European citizens and taxpayers money, with no benefit to human welfare or health. Faced with a text that is potentially of great interest to animal lovers – I am one too – and that will naturally have positive consequences for animals themselves, people are seeking to table amendments that undermine all the premises of the text and the very meaning of our friends’ welfare, with abstract suggestions of no legal or ethical value. Therefore, I cannot help wondering whether we should be investing – maybe I should say ‘wasting’ – time and resources to deal with proposals devoid of any practical interest for Europeans. Consequently, I shall be voting for Ms Paulsen’s report. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the objectives of the programme for food distribution include reasonable prices, market stabilisation and support for deprived persons. The institutions and national authorities have confirmed the need for full support of the programme through the EU budget, rejecting proposals for cofinancing by the Member States. There has been discussion about food wastage. We recently approved the report by Mr Caronna, which included the problem of the meagre access of the poorest population groups to food. I think that the issues are closely linked: helping to reduce wastage also means helping the most deprived. There are many local initiatives to help people in financial difficulties. I would like to mention the example of food collections, which should play a more prominent part in the programme on which we have been asked to vote. People who wish to donate spontaneously but do not have channels to do so need to be organised and put online. I would like to take the opportunity to thank all those who work towards these goals in their everyday lives. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate my fellow Member on choosing the issues tackled. Why new skills? Changes in the labour market undoubtedly make it necessary to change and acquire new skills. However, what should we do with the skills that represent our heritage and our traditions? Ms Bastos highlights the need to maintain the craft tradition and its associated skills. However, we need to do more. What about the trades that were once pivotal to the economy in certain areas? These areas, for example, in the mountains and foothills, no longer exist, having been abandoned in favour of the cities. One solution which could help create jobs and therefore help with employment might be precisely to rehabilitate certain trades and traditions, which would also help disadvantaged areas. In order to ensure certain jobs continue, we need to invest in the young and give them a leading role in projects, traditions and trades that have fallen into disuse in the areas in question. Training aimed at finding young people jobs in small companies in these areas would have a two-fold benefit, helping to rehabilitate abandoned areas and increasing youth employment.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the key word in this report is ‘consumer’. We often forget who we are addressing when we take decisions. Important decisions have been taken in the report we are discussing, such as the indication of specific nutritional value or the indication of origin, in order to give consumers more correct information. It is a step forward, not the ultimate goal. Indication of origin for agricultural food products –
 the provenance of the main foodstuffs that make up a product –
 should be the first information available to the consumer. There are various cases in which traceability is vital, the latest being the bacteria which unfortunately killed several people. By identifying the provenance of a product it is possible to take swift action or to safeguard the product from incorrect information. The issue of competitiveness is no less important. Often an indication of origin can be a guarantee and a promise of quality. The various quality products of each country have won the trust of consumers. We support the indication of origin because consumers have the right to know what they are eating. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, of all Europe’s policies, the common agricultural policy is the one that has had to be updated the most over the years in order to cope with constant changes occurring on the economic front, including at international level. It has always been updated with two main goals in mind: guaranteeing an income for European farmers and dealing with an ever-decreasing EU budget, while not forgetting a whole host of other objectives linked to quality of production, of the environment, of biodiversity and of water resources. The CAP reform on which we will vote tomorrow is vital if we are to continue to support the income of our farmers, as my colleagues have already mentioned. The aim, then, is not to reduce direct subsidies but to find a balance between such subsidies and rural development, so that the system is rendered simpler and fairer, without the rules of competition being called into question. As regards the objectives of the CAP in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy, the CAP can contribute to the growth of a sustainable economy by responding well to new challenges and taking account of the diversity and richness of agriculture and the specific characteristics of the 27 Member States.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer my contribution by stating the need for a new methodological approach, particularly in the heritage and cultural heritage sector, linked to the intelligent use of new technology. An awareness of the massive potential for improvement that new technologies can offer us, both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, necessarily involves abandoning the ways we worked in the past. New technologies mean new working methods. I myself have witnessed that by using technology intelligently in the monument protection sector, it is possible to obtain significant results, in terms of both the planning and restoration works. Additionally, as a simultaneous by-product, and without incurring additional costs, we can obtain highly accurate geometrical databases that can be used to monitor and manage the artefact in the event of natural disasters, as well as products for scientific education and for promoting the artefact on a global scale, fulfilling criteria for cultural understanding and exchange What I think matters most is that we contribute to a plan of action, whose aim is to help us reach a new awareness of technology, so that new economic opportunities may be created for Europe. I believe especially in the need to train new people and in professional, young and highly qualified individuals, who are able to rise to the challenges posed by the new global market.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, novel foods are food products or ingredients that undergo production processes and involve a change in nutritional value. I have a number of doubts about the new Novel Food Regulation. What relation will it bear to the regulation on genetically modified organisms (GMOs), since cloning is an aspect of genetic engineering and, as with GMOs, it involves actual genetic manipulation? How will the movement of these foods between European countries be regulated? How will the scientific tests needed to test the safety of these novel foods be carried out? What will the criteria be for defining these products and, most of all, how will consumers be informed of the characteristics and nutritional properties of the novel foods they purchase? My central concerns are consumer protection, food safety in the use of these novel products, and correct information. I therefore believe there must be total traceability for consumers, especially for natural products, for which we already find it difficult to guarantee traceability. Giancarlo Scottà,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased with this initiative, which aims to transform the European Heritage Label into a formal action of the European Union in order to increase its effectiveness, visibility, prestige and credibility. To this end, I should like to emphasise the importance of the professionalism of the members of the panel of experts appointed to evaluate the sites, as well as the rigorousness of the procedures for attribution of the label and reviewing its maintenance as time goes on. These elements are essential to ensure the specificity and quality of the label itself. The label must, however, focus entirely on symbolic and educational value, rather than on the beauty of the site – as other initiatives for the promotion of cultural heritage tend to – so as to clearly differentiate it from these. Therefore, I also agree that transnational sites should be held in particular consideration, in virtue of their symbolic importance. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome Mrs Mănescu’s report. Multi-level governance has a key role to play in cohesion policy and, in this respect, the multi-level approach, which provides for cooperation and shared responsibilities across various levels of government, is being put into practice in the management of regional funds. The Commission is promoting initiatives in favour of regional and local authorities. There must be a greater incentive to support such proposals in order to ensure the real coordination and effective implementation of European programmes. The partnership must be guaranteed by a culture based on dialogue between the various parties involved. Cooperation at regional level must be transparent and must ensure fair representation of all concerned. For this reason, it is important to provide appropriate training for subnational representatives through initiatives such as Erasmus for regional and local officials, the financial cost of which must be borne by the Commission. This is likewise useful for exchanging good practices and for improving the quality and effectiveness of cohesion fund management. Giancarlo Scottà,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the third summit between the European Union and Africa is a fundamental opportunity to consolidate relations between the two parties. During this event we will talk about economic growth, sustainable development and political governance, considering several dossiers, including an examination of the agriculture and food safety sector in the context of the Millennium Development Goals. In order to guarantee universal access to food, combat poverty in rural areas and improve the quality of agricultural production, the participation of producers’ organisations and sector associations is required so that they can be committed and aware, and improve the distribution and management of natural resources. The European Union must work to make the best of these opportunities to intensify dialogue and cooperation in support of regional integration in Africa. In particular, the imbalances and corruption of cooperation initiatives must be fought. Governments’ responsibilities must not predominate over those of civil society and the participation of all those involved in strategies of sustainable economic and social growth must be guaranteed.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, cereal price volatility is having severe repercussions on all livestock sectors but also on consumers. Cereal exporting is blocked due to the effect of the heat, fires, drought and floods – as is happening now in Italy. To aggravate the situation, Canada has reduced production following heavy rainfall this summer. Prices have been influenced not only by climate change but also by speculation on international markets. Cereal producers who are awaiting a price increase wait before selling their produce and put it in store, with the result that these agricultural products deteriorate. Speculation and severe climate change have led to a great increase in the prices of cereals used as animal feed and a knock-on increase in meat prices. I believe it is essential for the Commission to ensure timely, targeted action to deal with the volatility in agricultural-product prices through innovative market interventions under the new CAP. The Commission must prevent speculative practices in agriculture to preserve the businesses of farmers and stock breeders and guarantee consumers genuine quality products at fair prices.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to a sector in which conditions for the female workforce continue to be precarious. I refer to the agricultural sector, a sector in which women focus on innovation and, at the same time, on revitalising traditions and preserving agricultural heritage, keeping rural territory alive. Yet female workers encounter a range of obstacles in their working activities, having to reconcile their working life with family life. Mrs Thomsen, in her report, provides a figure which gives us food for thought: in the agricultural sector, 86% of female workers are employed part-time. Furthermore, the entry of young women into this sector is fraught with difficulty and for this reason, women managing the farms are often over 65. On the other hand, some other women assume the position of supporting partner, or rather, they help with their husband’s farm, without being entitled to a legal status and without being appropriately remunerated. I would argue, therefore, that it is necessary to protect women and their employment in a sector in which their work is often temporary and seasonal, support them in the area of health and safety, and ensure they receive fair pay and appropriate recognition for their work.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, future regional and cohesion policy must be aligned with the Europe 2020 strategy priorities, and therefore it must be focused on the objectives of sustainable growth, social inclusion and employment. It needs to support the effective development of the European regions by levelling out the differences between them and enhancing the specific characteristics of the more marginalised areas which are still facing regional development challenges. The projects must take into account the less developed regions, which have been most severely affected by the crisis. New challenges such as population density in certain areas and depopulation in others, in mountain areas, in particular, along with climate change, must be addressed through concrete actions that strengthen local and regional involvement. The multi-level approach must stimulate the integrated development of disadvantaged areas by involving local and regional authorities as well as civil society. I urge the Commission to take into account the specific characteristics of each region, namely the regional dimensions of the various levels of development, and to simplify the management and control procedures for financed projects in order to ensure their effective and prompt execution.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon devotes particular attention to regions with severe and permanent handicaps. This is why I support Mr Provera’s initiative concerning the agricultural, environmental and cultural rehabilitation of these regions. I therefore call for the Commission to set to work as soon as possible on implementing a policy for mountain regions that will tackle the difficulties, declining population and abandonment of mountain regions, with the environmental degradation that that entails. It is crucial to provide for the agricultural activity, quality of life and cultural heritage of those living in disadvantaged conditions, and it is fundamental to ensure that the actions undertaken by the Commission, the Member States and regional and local authorities are in harmony with one another. A fundamental principle of the European Union is subsidiarity, an instrument that is crucial to promoting the development of disadvantaged regions through lasting and well-targeted measures resulting from regional proposals. This is a significant challenge, and the task will be to keep people in these regions, or, better still, to encourage them back there. Giancarlo Scottà,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is both important and necessary to achieve a balance between the need to advance scientific research and the need to protect animal welfare. Protection for animals used in scientific procedures is currently inadequate. New scientific knowledge means that alternatives can be promoted to replace or reduce the use of animals. Methods or procedures must be used that cause as little pain and suffering as possible, but without impeding scientific research designed to fight diseases. It is therefore right to review Europe’s animal protection legislation in order to achieve satisfactory results that both meet the demands of the research industry, given the need to pursue scientific research that benefits human health, and, at the same time, look after the welfare of those animals still needed for scientific purposes.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lyon, ladies and gentlemen, in a context such as this, farms need strong support in order to innovate and make progress. The role of farmers needs to undergo a radical change: by systemising agricultural production farmers become agricultural entrepreneurs, and thus promote economic development. I believe it is fundamentally important for the recovery of countless abandoned areas of land to be used in the creation of short, closed agricultural branches – in other words, systems that link agricultural cultivation directly to sales. These systems can operate and become widespread throughout the European Union. I believe that, under the new common agricultural policy (CAP), the Commission should support the creation of agricultural cooperatives so as to cut production costs and make farmers more competitive. The Commission must commit itself to defining a budget that is sufficient to achieve these objectives. The funding for the new CAP must be linked to results, so as to prevent waste and various kinds of speculation. What is more, at this time of crisis, many young people want to return to farming. However, they are faced with various obstacles: land is too expensive, and rural development policies are difficult to manage; the fact that there are long waiting times for land and that it is granted on the basis of earnings rather than on the basis of the ideas expressed by young entrepreneurs prevents this group from realising its potential. I believe that the Commission must take a supportive and flexible approach to helping young farmers. An information policy must also be launched, starting in schools and universities, in order to promote a … (The President cut off the speaker) Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Spanish Presidency has decided to sign this agreement. This decision has caused some concern, as we have already heard, and in tabling this question my fellow Members are asking for clarification as regards the impact that the negotiations may have on European producers and products. I wished to point out that the creation of a free-trade relationship between the two parties allows for imports into Europe of animal products containing antibiotic growth activators that have not undergone sufficient testing, and of genetically modified agricultural products that could jeopardise farmers’ food safety. I therefore call on the Commission to adopt an authoritative position so as to safeguard European quality production. The Commission must also undertake to ensure that Europe’s high production standards are recognised at international level and that these same standards are required of all imported products. Lastly, I believe that the Commission should take account of the concerns expressed by the various associations in the sector, so as to ensure transparent and fair negotiations that do not harm the European economy.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are being asked to vote on a draft report on information to consumers, but have we really asked ourselves what consumers want? Have these considerations been agreed on behind closed doors in Parliament, or do they reflect the interests of consumers? The latest survey announced by the Commission may not be representative of the increased awareness that consumers have developed in recent years with regard to information about their food choices. It is not only the origin but also the ingredients and other characteristics that are becoming a fundamental part of the decision-making process. Are we aware that the decisions we make today will influence tomorrow’s purchases? Should it not be consumers who determine the market? Why not try to understand, through a new survey or by maintaining ongoing direct dialogue with consumers, what it is that they really want? We must represent consumers as best we can. That is why we are here and, from the meetings I have had, I have discovered that consumers want to be involved more. They do not expect the buying process to be complicated by the inclusion of pointless information on labels, but nor do they expect overly simplistic, misleading choices such as the traffic light system, which risk providing irrelevant information that is not necessary for an informed choice and does not meet their needs. Our approach must not be paternalistic but open to dialogue. Giancarlo Scottà,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with market globalisation and the severe crisis now affecting Europe, including in the agricultural sector, one possible response on the part of the agricultural market is to place emphasis on product quality. I believe that a good EU quality policy can enhance competitiveness and create added value for Europe’s regional economies, since, for many rural areas where production alternatives are few, it is often the one and only opportunity for development. By supporting niche agriculture in these disadvantaged areas, we will create an economy and jobs there. Furthermore, a future quality policy must also be linked to the major potentialities of agriculture which, as in the European case, is modern, dynamic, rich and diversified and can offer not only high quality food products but also services of great value to a constantly evolving society. In my report, I emphasised the importance of keeping the three systems for registration of geographical indications separate, since they represent the link with European regions, representing their traditions, history, taste and unique knowledge handed down over time. I therefore believe that, by keeping the two PDO and PGI systems separate, they take account of the specific differences in the nature and strength of the links between the products and their geographical area of production. Consumers often confuse the geographical indication of where a food product was processed with the place of origin of the agricultural product as such, and are often not aware of how the food chain operates. I therefore consider that only the compulsory indication of the place of production of the primary products can provide consumers with full information on the quality of the products they are buying, since products are subject to a production cycle which exerts considerable influence on their characteristics in terms of quality and food safety. Let us remember that it is our duty to protect what our fellow citizens, who voted for us, produce and eat. Another two issues that I considered important to include in my report are as follows: the importance of an intensive campaign of consumer education and information, which the European Union should undertake concerning the various European labels and the guarantees they represent, and the inclusion in international registries and international recognition through the WTO system of geographical indications. This last point is vitally important if we want to protect against the counterfeiting of our high quality products. I would like to thank Commissioner Cioloş for his attendance and remind him of the importance of sufficiently protecting quality systems, which are our future, and remind him too that the economy of disadvantaged rural areas can be boosted by agricultural sector aid, to safeguard all those niche products that are typical of these areas and that keep the people connected to the locality, which would otherwise be abandoned. This would support respect for the environment and for the landscape and would create, where possible, a tourist and oenogastronomy economy linked to the various regional, cultural and historical differences in the European Union. I would like to thank my colleagues for the support they gave me in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and I hope that the European Parliament will also give its support during the vote tomorrow.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, Commissioner Cioloş. I should like to begin by talking very briefly about the land. The land is that from which we harvest our products and which we must preserve for the future and for those who will have to do the same. That is why, taking this simple thought as a starting point, I should like to move on to producers, to those who work the land, who must be recognised also by those who subsequently enjoy the commercial produce they find in the supermarket or some other shop. It is therefore only right that we respect first the land, which yields the produce, then the processor, if any, but above all the consumer. I should like to make a proposal for the benefit of consumers, and I am not sure whether it will be welcomed or not: why not ask consumers what they want to know? In this way, we will know which potential label consumers are able to read and to understand, and thus perhaps make it much simpler than the complicated labels we have today. Why must consumers not know that they have the choice of drinking a litre of milk from Europe or a litre of milk from Brazil? It will be for them to choose whether a litre of Brazilian milk is better than a litre of milk produced in the European Union. Be that as it may, I consider and I hope that this report will be useful for Commissioner Cioloş by providing further details to help grow that thread I referred to earlier: the land, the producer, the processor, if any, the consumer, safety and, above all on the issue of safety, quality. We have all spoken about quality, and I believe that we are all in favour of raising the quality of our produce even more if it means eating well and eating healthily. Giancarlo Scotta',

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to stress my doubts about the proposal to extend the 2009-2010 intervention period for butter and skimmed milk powder, since this proposal is in danger of turning short-term measures designed for the current crisis in the market into structural measures that would actually restore the dairy farming sector to the position it was in before quotas were introduced. In an effort to make the market measures more balanced, where benefits are not given solely to those Member States involved in butter and skimmed milk powder production, I call for the reintroduction of Community aid for private storage of cheese with a long maturation period. Lastly, I would like to draw your attention to the matter of the origin marking and labelling of dairy products and to the traceability of products: this is a request that comes directly from European consumers – in ever greater numbers – and one that might help us to tackle the crisis in the dairy farming sector. I hope that my fellow Members from the other groups, too, can endorse this proposal. Oreste Rossi  (EFD

 The European Commission must decide once and for all whether it wants to have a Solidarity Fund that responds to serious natural disasters and shows solidarity with those affected rapidly and promptly or whether it wants to indulge in some form of worthless public image exercise. We are dealing here with measures for European civil protection that require prompt provision of assistance to those in difficulty and the European Commission is not capable of releasing the financial assistance to help the earthquake victims of Emilia-Romagna. The proposal to obtain funds through redeployment, from sources that currently amount to EUR 13 million is ridiculous and the Commission should be ashamed of it. I also wish to underline that the European Commission is currently deciding whether to demand that enterprises return the assistance they received for flooding in 1994 and paid out to them by the Italian government, without realising that this would mean certain bankruptcy. I think that the Commission should seriously rethink its position, because it seems to have no knowledge whatsoever of the problems that are being discussed here today, or what it means to be affected by natural disasters.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution is based on a perfectly acceptable principle, which I myself have expressed more than once, underlining both the threat posed by climate change and the fact that it needs to be dealt with at an international level, but by all parties. It is wrong, however, to ask the European Union to take steps unilaterally to cut emissions by 50 % over the levels of the 1990s by 2050. It should be evident that if we continue to depress European industry, we encourage relocation of large enterprises to third countries. Unlike the members of the committee, I consider the Durban Package to be insufficient because no binding global agreement was reached on reduction of emissions. It is sheer madness to think of embarking on the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol unilaterally, in the absence of the United States, the Russian Federation, Japan and Canada, with uncertainty regarding Australia and New Zealand, and knowing that the great polluters such as China, India, Brazil and Indonesia continue to lack emissions reduction targets.

 I support the text of the report on the ‘Offshore Protocol’ because I believe there is a need for increased safety of offshore oil and gas exploitation activities, especially following the dramatic accident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Offshore activities in the Mediterranean are likely to increase due to the discovery of new reserves of fossil fuel, and an accident of such kind could have immediate large-scale effects on a semi-closed sea such as the Mediterranean, causing tragic consequences for its economy and its fragile ecosystems, and undermining the efforts made by EU Mediterranean coastal Member States to achieve and maintain good environmental status in their marine waters as required by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. In view of the importance of this Protocol on exploration and exploitation in the Mediterranean, the removal of harmful waste and the removal of disused installations, I hope that it will be complied with and implemented with provisions on safety and monitoring.

 I am in favour of the text under examination, which seeks the implementation of promotion measures and information provision for agricultural products. I believe that, for consumers to eat properly, they should be properly informed, with the product origin shown on the label. That is the only way of guaranteeing food safety. This policy aims to promote local markets, developing the concept of low food miles and at the same time enhancing market potential in the EU. I also support the promotion of information campaigns on quality wines, aimed at responsible consumption and – this should not be underestimated – the need to educate children on the importance of a healthy, balanced diet based on fruit, vegetables, etc. provided that these are of good quality. The quality policy for agricultural products should therefore on the one hand provide farmers with the tools to identify products with special characteristics and promote them more effectively and on the other protect them from unfair practices.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what concerns me is that I do not think we are the ones being irresponsible by being in favour of the extraction of something that could make Europe self-sufficient in terms of fossil fuels; it is the Greens criticising this stance who are irresponsible because they are fine about keeping themselves warm – obviously I do not think they stay cold – with the same or similar products imported from third countries where mining and drilling is done at the risk of causing earthquakes. You see, if you take oil or gas out from under the ground you create the same voids that are formed by extracting shale gas. So this is fine for other countries but it should not happen in Europe. We have to spend taxpayers’ money paying for stuff from third countries when we could – this is only a possibility – we could be self-sufficient with stuff we produce in Europe. At this point something does not make sense to me and I start to wonder whether the Greens have some other hidden agenda. I will close by saying that I really think caring for the environment is important, but I do not think we should miss this opportunity to extract something that could make Europe economically self-sufficient from the point of view of oil and gas extraction.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Ms Sartori because, with this initiative, we are finally able to discuss a problem that has affected hundreds of thousands of workers who, due to rash decisions that force the European Union to tackle climate change unilaterally and excessively, face losing their jobs. Steelworks, as major energy consumers, are even more crippled by the European Commission’s decision to withdraw some of the ETS quotas already distributed and its determination to set a minimum price for future auctions. This decision by the European Commission, which I criticised during a debate within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, will mainly affect the steelworks themselves, which already lost 10 % of their market share in 2011 and in 2012 stand to lose a further 12 %. The only solution to avoid unfair competition from third countries is to impose import tariffs, in proportion to the difference in the cost of steel production in Europe and in the third country.

Moreover, we must not underestimate the presence of child pornography websites, which can put at risk the lives of the very youngest, and of people who try to lure minors. It is for schools to train minors in the practical and critical use of the digital technology associated with the internet.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this presentation proposes objectives that we all support, such as combating unemployment, reintegrating the unemployed, relaunching small and medium-sized enterprises, guaranteeing the security of pension schemes – but it does not propose any measures for meeting these challenges. For example, it does not go into any depth in considering which resources the Member States should use to deal with the crisis, nor does it criticise the scandalous choice made by the European Commission in financing the banks without using the funds awarded to bring about economic upturn, thus allowing the credit institutions not to help businesses and families but to acquire government securities, ensuring a guaranteed profit for themselves at almost no risk. Accordingly, the decision was taken, in a period of crisis like this, to finance the banks rather than to encourage an improvement in the economic structure. It would have been an excellent proposal to call on the Commission to propose removing the prohibition on direct aid to the States by the European Central Bank.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rosy picture painted by President Barroso contrasts with a reality that is plain to see: millions of workers protesting for job and wage security so as to be able to support their families and hundreds of thousands of small enterprises in difficulty. In Italy there has been a wave of suicides by small business owners, suffering side-by-side with their employees, because your friend Mr Monti only wants to help the banks and could not care less if the whole system of small and medium-sized enterprises, which has been so much a part of our country socially and industrially, disappears. I would also like underline one case that could be seen as emblematic of a Europe that is standing by and watching the death of its industrial, productive and above all manufacturing capacity. Anomalies in European funding have been discussed, but there is one instance of funding that stands out from all the rest. You have awarded the brother of Totò Riina EU funding. The brother, in other words, of the boss of bosses of the Italian mafia. And you granted funding to another boss while he was still in prison. Well that is a disgrace!

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's discussion, which doubtless reprises other previous discussions, gives us a fairly limited picture of the problem, in my humble opinion. We cannot tackle the social problem and the social aspects and implications of this large-scale restructuring, which do not just affect the companies mentioned by the Commissioner. In Italy, for example, Fiat’s chief executive is misleading the public, and more importantly Fiat’s employees, by saying, ‘Don’t worry, our new products will be sold on the US market’, when everyone knows very well that the US market has no need for more imports; it is quite capable of meeting its future production requirements, even though it seems to have its own problems which are very different from Europe’s. In Europe there is no industrial policy for the automotive sector: we have a European Union which is dilly-dallying and has failed to come up with a sound plan, in view of social and other developments. The market has completely changed, and Europe needs to wake up. It needs to do something, because we need to maintain and conserve the level of quality and the technological and development capacity of manufacturing, especially in a key sector such as the European automotive industry.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Erasmus programme should be defended tooth and claw for the rights and future of our young people. It would be much better to cut the super-high pay and pensions of our senior officials, those untouchables of the European Union, or to reduce the gifts to high finance and the banking system. Some practical suggestions have been made by young people involved in Erasmus. During the Erasmus Day Live initiative, some suggestions were made to President Barroso such as exchanging homes, which could make it easier and less expensive for families, or introducing some working hours (young people want to work, and they could do so in libraries and archives, or in cultural institutions), and regionalisation. Some regions like my own, Piedmont, have suggested intervening along the lines of the principle of subsidiarity. Let us expand the basis for participation in Erasmus, let us give young people the role of offering suggestions and taking action. Erasmus is important. We critics of Europe are more supportive of Erasmus than some pro-Europeans, who want to cut not high-level bureaucracy, not costs or waste – good heavens, no! – but the things that serve the future of young people in Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not find this banking union convincing, because it seems to have no purpose other than to place a fine gravestone over any prospect of adopting the legal principles of the Glass-Steagall Act in Europe. In that respect, how can we not share the concern expressed by Georg Fahrenschon, the president of the German savings banks association, for whom a banking union with centralised supervision in the hands of the European Central Bank (ECB) and a common deposit guarantee fund is like a life assurance policy for ‘systemic’ banks, in other words those banks – not all of them – whose bellies are full of derivative rubbish? We are all well aware of that, but nobody dares say it! This solution will ensure that healthy banks, such as savings banks (not only the German ones but also the ones in Padania) and cooperative banks, which are close to the land, the people and the regions – you may recall the message given out yesterday by 2 million Catalans who want their freedom – will foot the bill so that the sick ones can continue to speculate. I would like to ask a final question: every day, Mario Draghi, the President of the ECB, says that the euro is irreversible.

For Italy, unless the European Stability Mechanism’s role as a panacea is fully supported by the ECB – something that remains to be seen – Mr Monti’s victory will be exactly like Italy’s football win against Germany: a Pyrrhic victory. Perhaps we can be saved from this danger of a future debacle by Our Lady of Fátima, but certainly not by your indecision, uncertainty or by pulling the wool over our eyes. Is what came out of the corridors of your summit true or not? Namely, the fear of Heads of State or Government that there will be a massive collapse in the banking sector which holds billions of derivatives thanks to your inattention, to tax havens, to everything that you allowed to happen. Why then, are you not straight with us about the heart of this problem: not state securities, but the great banking and financial collapse of the derivatives market, of financial speculation, given free rein by a certain world of finance that rules in Europe, and unfortunately also in my country now?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that the debate is being held within the wrong frame of reference. The debate is not about having more Europe or less Europe. Current events force us to think about a completely different Europe: participatory, united, regional. A century ago, a certain Luigi Sturzo, exiled in England and writing in the English newspapers, was more modern in his thinking than this House, which refuses to consider Europe’s problems from the point of view of territories and regions, which is to say the productive, hard-working world which is the reality for our people. Today, I would like to represent the people of the industrial triangle of agricultural production of Mantua, Ferrara and Modena, where a major seismic event has caused serious problems for one of the most important productive centres in Europe. However, aside from a few visits by Mr Tajani and Mr Barroso, which I concede are important and which I must acknowledge, there has been no debate on practical issues. There is no central intervention on the ground that responds to the expectations of these communities. This Europe thinks in a Brussels way, like our centralist states! Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when this declaration was written, perhaps no one envisaged that, when the time came to debate it, the spread would have been consistently over 500 and, God forbid, even at 600 for Spain and, God forbid indeed, for Italy too. So, we want to combat speculation. This morning, President Barroso extolled to us the virtues of his solution of creating a European banking union. This, however, actually amounts to a way for the European Union to get its hands on our savings. Banking union will not protect European savers. National governments will lose any powers that they have or want to have over their respective national banking systems, whose contents will be poured into an undifferentiated melting pot of debt. In essence, banking union is an attempt, and quite a blatant one at that, to ward off insolvency in the Spanish banking system today by using the savings of the other euro area Member States, even poor Italy, harshly enough. It seems, then, to be a preventive strike against the growing support for the real reform that could solve the problem of this bankrupt system: in other words, banking separation or the Glass-Steagall Act. Essentially, this means separating savings banks from investment banks, which is the only way to prevent savings from being used to plug gaps or being lost when the speculators fail. We are witnessing the umpteenth attempt to contain a crisis by isolating it, as if the crisis were not affecting the entire euro area. This attempt must be stopped before it is too late.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the previous government was right to put a stop to the constant migration flows in circumstances that certainly did not allow a reception worthy of the name. One reason is that the centres – and the report is very vague on this issue – are regularly destroyed by their delightful occupants, whether they are illegal or irregular migrants, and of course Europe, the muggins in this whole affair, pays for this destruction with its taxes. It is true that the European Union has provided significant aid, but part of this has been, has had to be used to rebuild what the kind third-country nationals have destroyed, at the cost of European taxpayers. And we should have the courage to set this down on paper! Just as with regard to human rights, when these missions take place, we should also be concerned about making sure that the rights of workers are respected, as I have always done when I have been involved. Police forces and staff have to be protected, given that there have been cases of murder. Therefore, the government has done the right thing in regulating this emergency and these flows efficiently and energetically, in an attempt to help protect Europe’s external borders.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that in its laudable desire to help develop, aid and, I would suggest, influence the meaning and direction of the Arab revolutions in the sense of opening up towards democracy and economic development based, obviously, on a productive economy, the Commission has failed to meet its objective by linking all of this to the possibility of exporting agricultural products, etc. Undoubtedly, some pertinent comments have been made on this subject, because if we deprive these countries of their agricultural products, we impoverish them. In addition, why do we not start thinking seriously about the role of our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in order to introduce them there as a real work-training tool, which your bureaucrats cannot do as it can only really be done by those who know how SMEs are created, and that is by our small and medium-sized enterprise owners. Let us therefore encourage them to cooperate. Cooperation and economic recovery can only take place from the bottom up, with serious, concrete actions, not statements of principle and philosophical comments, which achieve nothing.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before making my case I feel that I must tip my hat to Mr López Aguilar, the Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for the very balanced way he conducted the debate and for his most dignified and sober words, which I do not think anyone has dared to refute with any sincerity or good reason. This morning, rather than getting into a series of philosophical or jurisprudential debates, we ought to take a responsible look at our fellow citizens’ right to safety. In particular we need to be thinking about those people such as workers and young people who have been victims of terrorist attacks on trains, perhaps, carrying workers, young people, and so on. We need to think about the right to safety, which must prevail over our personal and political considerations and those of a Eurosceptic group which I do not think will be able to vote in favour, as Mr Batten said. The Lega Nord
 Members of the House, meanwhile, will definitely vote in favour of this measure, not because we are not receptive to the serious and well-founded concerns over privacy, but because we think that right now there is a risk of widespread and possibly nuclear terrorism hanging over the world.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barroso has announced measures for small and medium-sized enterprises, but is he aware that in my land, Padania, every day a funeral is held for a small business owner who has committed suicide because his company is in debt and he does not have the money to pay his staff, and his staff are at his funeral? Your ‘non-solutions’ are taking the ship of the European economy and finance straight towards the iceberg of large-scale international speculation, and you do not seem to be aware of it. Let us consider these ‘non-solutions’ – the ‘bail-out fund’, a body not controlled by the EU institutions, but by stakeholders of the international financial lenders, and then this gigantic – the Chair of the European Central Bank (ECB) is not here – but we need to be brave enough to say that there is a gigantic conflict of interest between taxpayers, the European citizens that we represent, and the bosses of the ECB, that is, the gentlemen from the big central banks, which, in turn, are owned by private banks and by private finance. This conflict of interest should frighten us. Come on, let us leave the single currency, let us go back to our national currencies ...  (The President cut off the speaker) Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Madam President, I will use my explanation of vote – having voted for this report – to draw the attention of the House, or at least what remains of the House, to a very important statement, the statement by the Nobel prize-winning economist, Joseph Stiglitz, who – we read in the periodical of the University of Columbia, where he lectures in economics – has revealed that the decisions of the European Central Bank (ECB) are made according to instructions from a little-known organisation called the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. These statements are, at the very least, worrying. Does the European Union intend to find out whether these significant and weighty statements are true? Because of all the things we find out about derivatives, one thing is certain, and that is that there is an organisation and a mysterious trafficking that allows the system of major international speculation to decide on the policies which then affect actual people, working men and women who are responsible for producing in Member States, and this does not correspond to our vision of a Europe which needs to be a Europe of people and regions, not of bankers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have this morning heard many criticisms of the French President’s electoral posturing on immigration and on Schengen. This criticism has been developed from the point of view and through the lens of populism. Fair enough. I would like to apply the same analysis to the news in all the major European dailies yesterday and today. I am referring to the important stance taken by the greatest progressive European philosopher, the elderly but very clear-sighted Mr Habermas, who has looked at the reform, the fiscal compact, from a very specific point of view. He says that this reform, this pact, should not be approved because it is like wanting to increase, or rather, fooling ourselves that we want to increase, integration among Member States without civic integration among citizens. He says that it highlights the fact that only a democratic Europe, only popular will – even expressed through a referendum I would say, but that is my opinion – could produce politically credible decisions. He calls the European Union arrogant in its dealings with citizens and dominated by speculators. I had grown used to quoting Junger, but from now on, I will quote Habermas when criticising, from a populist and democratic point of view, your bad decisions which impact on the people. Maybe they are taken by the inner circle – the inner circle of the Bilderberg or Trilateral meetings – but they are obviously not taken here. Such decisions are then imposed on the people, without caring one jot about the real economy of those who work and sweat, workers and entrepreneurs. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have heard much harsh criticism of the Dutch Government’s guidelines with regard to family reunification. These criticisms of a country, which, in the full exercise of its sovereignty, is adopting more restrictive rules on such a delicate issue, one so closely related to the fundamental issue of immigrant integration, call to mind an official government document, which will be presented today, of all days, in Rome. This is the eighth report on immigration published by the Italian National Council of Economy and Labour (CNEL) – an Italian constitutional body – showing that the Italian regions and provinces in which integration has been most fully and seriously implemented are those in the north, and particularly in the north-east: that is, precisely those regions – such as the Veneto – governed by the Northern League, a movement which many in this Chamber regard as xenophobic. This leads me to believe that it is precisely the adoption of strict rules, of a substantial immigration filter, that can lead to true integration. Moreover, this is what emerges not from a biased opinion, but from an official government document, with constitutional status in my country. Let us therefore examine these proposed rules. Are they rules fit for the Third Reich or are they reasonable norms? When an immigrant, in order to obtain family reunification, is required to demonstrate that he has a job, a certain economic stability, etc.; when strict measures are called for with regard to the shameful scam of forced marriages or marriages of convenience, all we are asking for is European standards. In short, what we want are standards compatible with European judicial culture. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an excellent and balanced report which also rightly refers to the principle of subsidiarity, and therefore recognises the important and pre-eminent role played by Member States. The report, however, also paints a picture of a multi-speed Europe. As far as my country is concerned, there are two speeds. On the one hand, there are certain cities and regions – for example, Naples and Campania – that are a source of shame for those of us who, for the moment, have identity cards issued by the Italian State, a great source of shame that we continue to denounce. On the other hand, there are the virtuous towns of Padania where we have hundreds of mayors, for example, those of the Northern League, who may be ‘barbarian dreamers’, but who are also civilised people who teach citizens and ensure that they sort their rubbish and who organise the collection and incineration of waste. This civilised part of our country is an example for Europe. So let us move forward in this direction. I welcome the petitions which also inform the European authorities of these situations which, as I have said before, in Campania also pose a threat to European tourists who risk setting foot in those areas.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Ms Alfano can look at the European Parliament website where, modestly speaking, I am described as President of the provisional government of Padania. This is an official document of the European Parliament. Also, when she leaves her mafia homeland to come up north, she can see road signs saying ‘Higher Padania’ or ‘Lower Padania’. It was not invented by Mr Bossi; it is the civilised land of us Padanians, barbarian dreamers. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, complying with the rules certainly does not mean abdicating one’s sovereignty. Furthermore I do not believe that the rules referred to and described justify effectively being put in the dock, because this is the earnest desire of many groups that remained silent when democratic demonstrations were repressed elsewhere, in Belgium for example, and three parliamentarians were put in prison because they wanted to commemorate September 11th. Mr Orbán, today all the patriots among us feel Hungarian, feel proud to be Hungarian, and we envy your people for experiencing a new-found freedom after conquering it in the way that it did. Come and visit us in Padania, where you will receive a hero’s welcome, because we welcome those who defend their sovereignty. You will be welcomed as a Prime Minister who, unlike others such as our own Prime Minister, is not a servant to powerful lobbies, and perhaps this is why you do not have the favour of international finance, given that it seems to want to tie the financial hands of a free Hungary, denying it the support that is provided without question to every other country in difficulty. I believe it is time to say that perhaps our peoples should be the ones to open infringement proceedings against those who, without a popular vote, have devolved their sovereignty to others, have abandoned their sovereignty, starting with monetary sovereignty, and I invite you to defend your country's monetary sovereignty. Those of us who have abandoned it anti-democratically and without consultation find ourselves in this fine financial situation. Courage, Mr Orbán, carry on along this route.

 Mr President, I am really afraid that the meagre, disappointing results of the Brussels summit mark an historic moment: the end of the historical inevitability of European unity. That should be a cause for concern, particularly to those who have always shown themselves to be enthusiastic about Europe. The summit was, in fact, a pointless farce that has not calmed speculation, let alone stopped it. One fact certainly makes us realise that investors are afraid of a euro default soon. The European Banking Authority revealed it when it announced that some 40 banks in the European Economic Area have sold EUR 170 billion of credit default swaps (CDS) on Greek, Irish, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish bonds. The soaring CDS market is a sure sign that the markets are afraid of a default, that there is a lack of confidence, that speculation is rising and that investors are waving goodbye to Europe, thus giving speculation free rein. The euro as a currency is heading for disaster, since the markets are tending to reject it. This is the result you have achieved. Congratulations! Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a few hours ago President Van Rompuy declared that the Member States need to renounce their sovereignty in order to find a solution to rescue the economic and financial situation in the euro area and in Europe. This could prove a huge sacrifice for those who, every day, or at least during celebrations, such as the 150th anniversary of the unification of Italy, flock together and pride themselves on symbols of national unity and flags. It may be less of a sacrifice for us representatives of Padania, but I ask President Van Rompuy and the other exponents of the European elite: what will we get in return for renouncing our national sovereignty? A bluff, because where are we going to get, for example, the EUR 400-600 billion in aid that Italy is being promised, at least according to the rumours that are circulating? Certainly not from the International Monetary Fund. As regards intervention by the European Central Bank, there is the seemingly insurmountable obstacle of the Treaties, and so we ask ourselves: are these requests genuine, or are they a bluff? Are we taking things seriously? What are we talking about? I believe that Italy’s present situation, with its three-year government bonds standing at 8%, does not offer much in the way of hope, at least not in the short and medium terms. This is extremely worrying! I should also like to learn more about the Plan B that various States are rumoured to be preparing – it is even being said that Germany is preparing to mark euros with an indelible inscription that is supposed to guarantee the German character of those euros. We should like to learn more from Mr Monti’s mysterious advisors. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would say to Mr Posselt that sovereignty represents the cultural and hence political identity of the Member States. It is inalienable from the point of view of, say, belonging, and the Union that our free countries have built through European integration must never overlook, overshadow or abolish the principle of national sovereignty, which must remain in force unless we accept – which we shall never do – a certain principle: that of the construction of a superstate that destroys the identity and hence also the rights and freedoms of the individual States and the individual regions.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to talk of the usual programme of cuts to financial revenue and the fight against speculation, but I hear little of anything concrete. Instead, one should speak clearly about separating banks that are collection oriented from those that are speculation oriented, such as Goldman Sachs, which, in fact, seems to have become the calling card with which you present us the saviours of Greece and the saviours of Italy. I do not believe in a European Union which imposes these characters as a diktat
, these characters who are all authoritative members of those estimable consortia such as the Trilateral Commission or the Bilderberg Club, which also bring together the protagonists, the heads of the European Union, without admitting any outsiders, because these protagonists are from a place where secret decisions are made – decisions which then have an impact on the people. You always talk about cuts – cuts on the real economy and cuts on salaries and pensions, but never about cuts on the profits made by banks, and never about cuts on finance chiefs. What a great epilogue for our country’s celebrations for 150 years of national unity – the total sell-out of Italian sovereignty to the mighty powers of the lords of the world! Congratulations!

 Opposition to Bulgaria and Romania joining the Schengen area is due to what should be one of the mainstays of European policy: the precautionary principle. In fact, it is to be expected that some Member States, already subject to intense flows of immigration, may be put under increasing strain with the entry into the Schengen area of two countries that do not seem to have achieved sufficient control of their external borders. This is particularly clear with regard to the border between Bulgaria and Turkey. We cannot allow the free movement of citizens unless we are satisfied that this does not lead to increases in petty crime and illegal immigration, reductions in security and risks to public order. The data on the fight against organised crime in these two countries are hardly comforting for those who desire to see a serious and effective EU policy against organised crime. Mario Borghezio,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Angelides report by the US Congress Commission of inquiry has clearly demonstrated that the crisis was avoidable and has pointed the finger at public operators and the financial system, referring to those responsible by name: the Federal Reserve, rating agencies, investment banks and the five major US banks responsible have all been blamed for the ongoing crisis. Even today, these practices are going on. The Commission of inquiry’s findings were preceded by the very serious, yet unheeded, warning that was also given by the crisis committee led by the Nobel Prize-winning economist, Maurice Allais. Unfortunately, the report does not say much about all this and, bowing to the superior knowledge of those economists – nearly all of them in fact – who were unable to predict the crisis, it overlooks today what is a key proposal for those who want to get to the root of the problem: to re-establish the principles of the Glass-Steagall Act, aimed at separating the activities of traditional banks from those of investment and merchant banks – speculation, in other words – and to prohibit the creation and trading of financial derivatives. The report also disregards one of the key aspects of this powerful formula, which is necessary to ensure a financial recovery and to successfully combat corruption through the use of drastic measures. Lastly, how can one ignore the negative impact of the crisis on a serious problem such as immigration? Mario Borghezio,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate comes at a very opportune time, a time that follows an emergency that it would not be right nor intelligent to underestimate, if only we think of what is happening and, unfortunately, will perhaps continue to happen, in Libya. With these scenes in North Africa, do we want to disregard the possibility that there can be an emergency two times, 10 times, God forbid, one hundred times greater? A great French author, Jean Raspail, had predicted it many decades ago, and today we are very close to this situation. So let us give it proper consideration before criminalising a small liberal country such as Denmark, which decides to defend its own borders. I am prepared to praise borders, and we should not criminalise the existence of borders. When controls are needed and when a country considers prioritising the safety of its citizens, it is necessary to respect that decision and that should be democracy according to the rules shared by all European countries. Thus let us pay great attention to and let us reflect with great concern on the danger of a biblical exodus from Africa. This danger exists and is very close, very close indeed … (The President cut off the speaker) Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have two observations to make with regard to the own-initiative report on the common agricultural policy. The first is that the consumer prices of agricultural products must be commensurate with the costs, effort and work, but also with the production costs, if we want European consumers to be able to eat healthy products of European agriculture, of the traditional agriculture that must be preserved. The second comment concerns a signal to the competent European authorities. Are they aware of the report by the Italian Carabinieri of the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies concerning milk quotas? This report clearly shows that the milk production quota, which was supposed to have been exceeded, thus forming the legal basis for the fines levied on Italian dairy farmers, was not in fact exceeded. This is very serious, because these fines could bring thousands of farms in Padania to their knees and drive them to bankruptcy. Free Padania! Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of Greece I will say that one only needs to listen to what has been discussed to realise what stage European governance is at. In fact it is steering by sight, with no precise aims. We have not been told anything for which I would keep my fingers crossed if I were a Greek citizen – perhaps a Greek worker or a small Greek entrepreneur facing ruin. As regards immigration, I have heard Italy criticised for not wanting to accept any refugees. A few hours ago, however, Mrs Malmström issued a public statement saying that when the tragedy of the Libyan exodus began everyone undertook to receive at least 800 refugees per country. In practice, nobody is receiving them, and she highlighted the positive case of Norway. They land in Lampedusa and a few in Malta, and we are the only ones taking them in. Italy has received them. Italy. People were talking about Minister Bossi, and there is also the Home Affairs Minister, Mr Maroni: both ministers are from this racist Lega Nord
 party, which has received the refugees. Unless there is proof to the contrary, that is the truth. Lastly there is the Croatia chapter. It is very important for Croatia to join, but it is also important to remember that the Pope warned the Croats to beware of a bureaucratic, centralist structure. Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, Article 4(2) of the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union states that verification, in accordance with evaluation procedures, that the necessary conditions for the application of the Schengen acquis have been met by the new Member States is an essential requirement for the Council to decide to abolish internal border controls with those States. Now, we believe that there would be an urgent need to establish regulatory and operational conditions preventing undesirable elements, who could undermine the security of Member States, from slipping into the EU unnoticed via Bulgaria and Romania, but our assessment is that those conditions do not exist today. The reports being discussed in Parliament are not reassuring because of the grave deficiencies which still exist at air, land and sea borders, starting with the performance of border controls. It is not surprising that our police forces are faced with numerous cases of illegal immigrants coming from those two countries every day. I suggest that we need to suspend the entry process to the Schengen scheme for Bulgaria and Romania as a precaution, not least in view of the foreseeably enormous pressure on the external borders of these two countries, which are becoming the holes in the Swiss cheese that is the European Union system regarding the entry of illegal immigrants.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this issue has the merit of having brought great hypocrisy to light. The only government within the European Union that has an interior minister from a party which you define as populist is the one that has had the courage to implement the most humanitarian measure: giving 25 000 Tunisian people permission to move freely. This is because we saw in the flesh that they were not 25 000 criminals, but people who had fled Tunisia. It was an emergency, we had to face it with common sense and we have tried to help. This shows a truth, namely that in many situations the real ‘goodies’ are us, the ‘baddies’. We who affirm the need to control immigration and external borders, continue to beg Europe – as Mr Cohn-Bendit has rightly done – to spread what might become 50 000 or 100 000 refugees across its territory, because the people who flee Libya are not criminals. These are the clear words of a movement which defends territory and identity, which is against immigration because it does not want people to be uprooted, and which condemns racism and xenophobia but also hypocrisy.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, despite being a Eurosceptic, I could be in favour of a plan, in view of the 2020 Strategy, to eliminate discrimination, difficulty and marginalisation if we were really being offered incisive action by the European Commission to control the behaviour of Member States. What we have, however, are these speeches about a great future, about great control, spoken by a European Commissioner who still cannot explain to me how it is that in her country, in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, these travellers are forbidden to set up camp whereas they can instead instal themselves close to my home, in Italy and in France. Thus we talk of giving a home to travellers, whilst in some European countries, specifically that of Mrs Reding, these people cannot even set up camp. In today’s edition of the main newspaper in my country, Il Corriere della Sera
, there is an article on a parent, who does not deserve to be called a parent, a traveller, who was arrested in Italy for selling her own little girl to traffickers who wanted to sell her into prostitution. She sold her own little girl. Others send them to do other things. Often it is they who do not to send them to school, despite pressure and attention from the authorities, mediators and charities. Do we want to talk about these problems as well?

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank Commissioner Malmström for her hard work week after week in dealing with this epic disaster – because that is what it is. Comments have been made, not only in this House, in an attempt to reduce and make light of what our government, our country and our people have had to face. It has been, and continues to be, an emergency –humanitarian and otherwise – of exceptional dimensions. I believe that our government, and especially our people, have really come out of this well in terms of international public opinion. The people of Lampedusa behaved remarkably in firstly welcoming the migrants and then helping them out of their own pockets, and then, at a certain point, they said ‘we cannot do this any more’, because in addition to the human rights we discuss every day in this House, we must also consider the rights of peoples, including their right to maintain their identity, their activities and, naturally, not to be invaded. The migrants also include illegal immigrants, criminals released from prison. This rightly concerns the countries that must accept them. Furthermore, when the migration takes on the dimension – I repeat – of an invasion, we need to face up to the issue. We are one hundred per cent with our people, no ifs or buts. The European Union must stand up and take note, Commissioner. In addition to human rights, we must consider our rights, the rights of indigenous peoples. For this reason, we fully endorse the efforts being made by Italian Government at the moment in Tunisia, because compared to the modest figures announced by the Commissioner, the Italian Government is offering Tunisia a lot. A lot is being done and we are confident we will achieve tangible results However, we must move from words to deeds and Frontex is not doing what should have been done to put an end to this hateful traffic, because this traffic is the shame of the Mediterranean and the European Union is partly responsible. Therefore, I say put a stop to people trafficking and I say yes to a Marshall Plan for these countries. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that at such a delicate time for the finances of the Member States of Europe, as was said a short time ago, I should like to sound an alarm about an expenditure that is under discussion in the Committee on Budgets: the astonishing case of the vast expenses set aside for the House of European History. I think it would be a disgrace if it were approved. We already own the Eastman Building, but between EUR 26 million and EUR 31 million have been allocated merely for renovation costs, plus EUR 3.3 million for the plans alone. The fixed costs amount to more than EUR 3 million whilst the variable costs come to EUR 3.2 million, plus EUR 3.2 million for a 50-strong staff, EUR 2 million for security and then EUR 13.45 million are required just to manage it. I think we ought to set an example of prudent spending through our institutions. This, however, would be a disgrace. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, of course we must recognise the serious errors of the West. We in Italy have made the mistake of thinking of Mr Gaddafi as ‘our son of a bitch’, as President Roosevelt would have said, while instead, he was simply one of the many sons of … that rule over their people and now even fire on them or make other people fire on them. How on earth has no one in Parliament mentioned the responsibility of the African Heads of State or Government, who, until yesterday morning, thought of him as a brother, pampered him, sent him to the United Nations as a representative leader for the defence of human rights, even leading him to declare himself the king of kings amongst African countries, or have I got the wrong person? Now, Europe is making another mistake: it pretends to ignore an obvious danger, as a great flood of Somalis, Eritreans and others flee Libya’s borders. We need to tackle this with real energy. We should use a Marshall Plan involving the network of small and medium-sized enterprises to help these people, not send weapons. *** Mario Borghezio,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not agree with the report where it says that the Commission should dictate policy on the Roma to the Member States. This approach does not obey the principle of subsidiarity, if it is true – as indeed it is – that these measures must be conceived and carried out at local, regional and national levels, since their impact is then on the regions and their native populations. I completely agree with inclusion, not discrimination, but I am still waiting to hear from Commissioner Reding when Roma camps will finally be allowed in her country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, for if I am not mistaken, they are not allowed there. This report seems to be a little unbalanced, because so many paragraphs call for support for the Roma, be they men, women, children, the elderly (...). None of them call for any measures to severely punish those Roma who show anti-social behaviour, for example. Who stops Roma children going to school, if it is not certain Roma parents? I believe these are topics that we need to have the courage to spell out clearly, defying political correctness. It is not the syrup of do-goodism but serious, surgical measures that will enable us to lance the boil of rackets, child exploitation and organ trafficking. Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Energy 2020 is a vast programme, but we should ask ourselves if we can achieve the target of 20% renewable energy by the due date, not least because the financial crisis is slowing investment. There remains one problem: supporting solar energy. Indeed, we subsidise China, now the world’s leading exporter of solar panels, and India, the leading exporter of wind power equipment. Hence the need to support research into the production of solar panels designed and produced in Europe and to promote the adoption of economies of scale in the photovoltaic-solar sector, by introducing such devices, for example, extensively in European cities. Something very different should have been done: a pan-European energy company should have been set up to safeguard a European public service, given that the distribution networks and their infrastructures already constitute existing, natural monopolies, which should clearly come under the same management. Instead, due to over-enthusiastic economic liberalism, priority was given to other solutions that certainly do not benefit consumers or users, but the shareholders of these big monopolies. We should remember that the production of CO2
 from cars has not dropped for 150 years. We are entitled to wonder if it could be time to dust off research projects into water engines. Mario Borghezio,

 Mr President, this will certainly not be remembered as an exhilarating chapter in Parliament’s history. The criticisms and attacks rained down on the Hungarian Government, in conjunction with the EU Presidency, with regard to the Hungarian media law’s alleged total failure to comply with European legislation, have been reduced to what they really are: an instrumental and specious attempt that, apart from anything else, is based entirely on ideological bias, which is even more shameful when it is used against a country that today has the struggle for freedom encoded in its DNA – and this has indeed been the case throughout its history, which we all remember very well. The political forces that have promoted this far from exhilarating debate are still heavily weighed down by the responsibility for what is certainly not a high level political manoeuvre. Rather, it is seriously invalidated by these purely ideological overtones, and it also has the failing of casting an undeserved shadow on the European Union Presidency, which is being held for the first time – and this is certainly a great political and historical fact – by a former communist country, joined with us today in freedom.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are grateful to the Commissioner for the commitments that have been made, although it should be said that with all the salaries the European Union pays around the world – with 136 diplomatic missions – it could perhaps have realised what was happening sooner. In fact, the situation was not even foreseen by the representatives of the Socialist International, one of whose members was the nice Tunisian dictator, whose brilliant social and political management of that country led to all this. We want to learn from the Commission why it does not talk to us clearly about sharing out these people among the various European countries. It is not fair – as the coastal states have been saying for a long time – that this problem should only affect the countries that have a Mediterranean sea border with North African countries. That is a fundamental point, and it is also fundamental to remember that Frontex has very limited resources: I have heard that two experts have been sent. There is a massive crisis taking place in Lampedusa, not least in humanitarian terms, which needs to be tackled with a task force of appropriate size in order to remedy the mistakes and failures of the recent past. The situation is extremely serious and it may also get worse from a public health point of view, since water has perhaps already begun to run out in Lampedusa. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council needs to look at the fact that Europe’s production system has no defence against the volatility of oil prices on the markets, because futures markets are being held hostage to sophisticated international financial speculation, meaning that prices now have very little to do with the fundamental principles of supply and demand. The Council must set itself the goal of providing the European Union with a practical instrument with which to create a regulated market, open to selected traders and managed by a completely trustworthy European partner. This is the thrust of an Italian Government proposal to create a European oil exchange aimed at establishing a stable oil market, which would be of huge benefit to businesses and consumers. Speculators’ enthusiasm for commodities is influencing oil prices, which are no longer based on the spot market, since the cumulative effect of advances and speculative manoeuvres ends up determining supply and demand in the real market. A European exchange would transform the current ‘non-market’ of paper barrels into an efficient, regulated and monitored real market based on real barrels of oil. We ought to discuss this with the Council as well. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a law has been passed in the United States requiring the Federal Reserve to detail how much of the USD 3 300 billion rescue package has gone to which banks. I wonder whether it would be subversive to ask you to adopt the same transparency criteria, unless the finance and banking super-lobby blocks it. Let us consider the situation: what future is there for this forced Union of free countries, which is based on the stronger countries bailing out the weaker ones? Technically, do we want to acknowledge reality, which is that the euro is a virtually bankrupt currency? How can we think of forcing countries with a weak economy to use it? Is a centralised monetary policy acceptable for countries that have such decidedly diverse interest rates? Mr Trichet himself, who has denied the danger of the European Central Bank becoming insolvent, does, however, admit that one of the reasons behind increasing its capital is to face up to the credit risk, in other words, the insolvency of the bonds purchased. It is also time for new stress tests on the largest banks and to give greater weight to high-risk bank debts, as the Minister for the Economy has requested.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, in the prevailing relativism of European politics, there is one word that is taboo: Christianophobia. For many years, however, serious and often tragic reports have been coming in from reliable and indisputable sources about the persecution of Christians on several continents. Europe needs to wake up, open its eyes and take concrete action. It needs to send out clear messages, such as the one we were expecting from Baroness Ashton. She could, for example, have quoted Pope Benedict’s inspired words for the World Day of Peace a few days ago, when he pointed out that to deny religious freedom is an insult to God and to human dignity, as well as a threat to security and peace. Concrete action is needed. What are we waiting for – as I asked straight away – to send a commission to check the situation of our Coptic Christian brethren in Egypt, an officially moderate country where they have practically no fundamental human rights at all, not even in public office, in the civil service? Wake up, wretched Europe, and remember your Christian roots! Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the New York Times 
revelations, investigations are ongoing in the United States into the secret club of nine banks – one of which is European – whose executives meet every Wednesday to agree what action to take on derivatives. The Crisis Committee was completely unaware and Europe is a mere spectator. The Federal Reserve had to account for the USD 13 trillion spent to bail out the banks. Would you mind telling us what the Fed asked for the European bank rescue packages? Is it not the critical situation in the banks – and not state budgets – that requires the sum in the European rescue fund to be doubled and the preparation of a EUR 2 000 billion bail-out? What is stopping us calling on the European Central Bank to account transparently and in detail for its actions as was done in the United States for the Fed? This would put paid to suspicions that  it acted and continues to act discretionally and not in the common interest of the citizens and taxpayers of the European Union’s Member States. Why on earth have discussions never been held over the adoption of measures to impose a genuine and effective separation between commercial banks and speculative banks, as in the Glass-Steagall Act?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the responses concerning Mr Assange’s case and his imprisonment on account of his ideas of freedom are reminiscent of those of Pontius Pilate. I would like us to consider three points: 1. This is a case of fumus persecutionis
, because the accusations are very weak; 2. the United States is putting pressure on a European country to extradite, even though it has not yet specified the legal grounds for this request; 3. a citizen’s European bank accounts have been closed, meaning that he cannot receive any financial assistance in Europe from his supporters. What is more, all the statistics confirm that the European public is in favour of these principles of freedom, that it wants Internet freedom, that it is in favour of freedom, despite the doubts and the problems that have emerged in the wake of this initiative, which I personally do not fully support. Nevertheless, we would like President Barroso to state what the limits are and what the protection of human rights and of freedom of expression is really and truly founded on. Are we looking at a virtual Guantánamo here? Are we facing the threat of an Orwellian total censorship of the Internet? That is the danger, and we need answers on this matter. It is also important to keep a check on Mr Assange’s prison conditions, because in Italy, not even Mafia members are held in complete isolation. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ears of the President of the European Central Bank, Mr Trichet, must really be burning as this debate continues. If we were in the ancient Roman senate, a senator would surely stand up in his toga and say to Mr Trichet: ‘Quousque tandem abutere
, Trichete, patientia nostra?
’ – how long are you going to try our patience, Mr Trichet? In effect, we must ask ourselves whether the right road is to avoid the dissolution of the euro – a very difficult task – or instead prevent the rescue of the euro from ruining the economies of our Member States after the europhile policies of Mr Prodi and so on have destroyed our industries, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, in Padania for example, bringing only redundancies and unemployment benefit. Why should the countries which are surviving the crisis be bled dry to the tune of almost EUR 100 billion to save Ireland which, with its policy of 12.5% business tax,, has until now been competing unfairly with the other countries? Where was European governance if, one month after passing its stress tests, the Anglo Irish Bank plunged to a deficit of EUR 8 billion? Where was Mr Trichet? Are we sure that the Irish bailout does not violate the Treaty of Maastricht? Fortunately there is a constitutional court in Germany that will declare that the absorption of another country’s deficit onto Germany’s books is unconstitutional. So it is time to say bye-bye euro, bye-bye euro. Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should like to express my sincere and earnest thanks to the rapporteur, whose skills and rigour have been put to good use in guaranteeing Member States that granting free passage to Taiwanese nationals and abolishing visas will not cause problems for the European Union. I am not so convinced about the latest work regarding Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania. Now there is even talk of abolishing visas for Turkey. In those situations, I am not convinced that the Commission and Parliament have done their job well, namely: ensuring the safety of European citizens. Therefore, I applaud the report and the vote in the European Parliament – which will surely be positive – all the more. History is not impermanent. People of a certain age remember what it was that what was once called Nationalist China represented for decades: it was a banner of freedom. The West must not forget who defended the principles of liberty when they were under threat elsewhere. Still now, in terms of human rights, I think a basic distinction must be made. The Chinese of Taiwan are therefore also welcome in my home region of Padania. The presence of such important and skilled individuals in the region already provides ample illustration of the ability of Taiwanese people to integrate into our society. Unlike other countries, Taiwan also has the merit of not exporting socio-political messages against the principles of liberty, the protection of human rights and respect for ethnic and religious minorities to the European Union together with its goods. The citizens of Taiwan are therefore welcome in the European Union and in Padania. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply wanted to call the attention of the President of the European Parliament to a judgment made several days ago. It is a matter that surely falls under the capacities of the Commissioner, to whom I extend my greetings. In my opinion, it is a very serious judgment, because it relativises the content of a very important European Union directive on terrorism. In fact, I believe that it is not possible to support an extensive attitude to protecting citizens who request the right of asylum and the right to be recognised as a refugee to those who belong to terrorist organisations. If this principle were to become accepted, as it did in this extremely serious decision of the European Court of Justice, we shall give many terrorists the chance to benefit from protection that they do not deserve. Too many people have died in Europe as a result of acts of terrorism to allow a situation of this type. I therefore urge the Commission to modify the directive so as to avoid extensive and indecent interpretations of the statement that the European Union rightly made in the fight against terrorism.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should have listened to the advice of the Nobel laureate, Maurice Allais, who called for a clear separation between business banks, credit banks and speculative banks, in accordance with the principles of the Glass-Steagall Act, which is not discussed in this report. As far as the proposal to tax European taxpayers is concerned, my response is ‘No tax in Europe!’ If this European Union proposal goes ahead, you can rest assured that we will have our own Tea Party here as well: there will be a mass protest. The European public has no intention of paying for a service they are not getting and they are perfectly right. We are continuing to fund the banks. However, what are the banks doing in the midst of this economic and financial crisis? They are buying securities, even ones that contain dodgy derivatives and so on. They are still buying them. And what is the ECB doing while this is going on? The ECB – set up to be an unchallengeable body – is letting it go on. It seems clear to me that this is a Europe for bankers. If even the Masonic leaders claim this to be true, I do not see why we cannot claim it too. We believe that there is only one way to combat speculation effectively: transactions carried out at the same time as negotiations are paid for, and only in cash. Mrs Merkel dared to say it and she was shouted down. There must be some reason for that. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Madam President, this is an important and significant report for the protection of women. The European institutions, however, suffer from the major fault of not practising what they preach. Last Friday and Saturday, a meeting attended by the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, the President of Parliament and President Van Rompuy was held with dignitaries from the most important European Masonic lodges, yet not a single word was said about the fact that most of these lodges do not allow women to join. More seriously, the meeting was held inside the European Parliament, behind closed doors, and not even Parliament’s own staff were allowed in. All that stands in contrast to the principles of transparency that should govern all activities of the European institutions. Mario Borghezio,

 Mr President, we will vote against this report not least because the rapporteur proposes exerting pressure on the Commission and the Council to speed up the process of visa liberalisation for Kosovo. Do we realise what we are discussing? Do we realise that Kosovo is finding it difficult to reintegrate the thousands of Roma who sought asylum in Germany? This is an extremely sensitive situation for the entire European Union. Do we realise that visa liberalisation – which I have heard said will be used only by students and respectable people, even though I personally do not agree at all with that optimistic statement – will simply mean that Europe becomes a hotbed of Roma? We really do not need this, considering the serious problems we are facing with integration and resolving the extremely severe problem of the Roma. As far as Albania is concerned, I would like to point out that the Commission again proposed in May that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina should be able to allow their citizens to circulate within the Schengen area with electronic passports. The proposal was not, however, taken forward due to Albania’s shortcomings with regard to reintegrating repatriated Albanians. I believe that security and control issues exist that weigh on visa liberalisation like boulders. We need to think about this very carefully: visas are necessary, and how! Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also award the prize for hypocrisy to Mrs Reding, who forgot to describe – at least according to the texts – the situation of the Roma in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, where the problem of expelling Roma does not exist simply because the setting up of Roma camps is not allowed by law; it is forbidden. Thus, there are many different ‘Europes’. I hope that this is an indication of what is to come: at this European Council, at last, a Head of State or Government felt compelled to teach the European Commission a clear lesson in patriotism. The Commission must not, not even through its Commissioners, allow itself to insult a Member State, in particular, a Member State such as France which could give us all a lesson on the concepts of freedom and humanity. There is a huge difference between what you call European law and the law of the peoples. European law is perhaps the right to enter other people’s houses and steal, not to send your children to school and to exploit them, as asserted not by racist populism, but – according to Le Monde
 – as asserted by the Prime Minister of Romania during the ‘déjeuner de fiel
’ – the ‘lunch as bitter as bile’ – on 16 September. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we did not vote for the motion for a resolution by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which is certainly more balanced, because of one key point to which we wish to draw your attention: the call for the European Commission, for Europe, to speed up the process to integrate Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen area. We feel – and we already sounded this alarm at the time of enlargement – that these countries have not yet adopted strict control policies for the issue of identity cards and recognition of nationality. Are the Commission and Parliament aware that in these countries certificates can be obtained with great ease from non-European countries enabling, thanks to the freedom of movement, illegal entry into the Schengen area? We must pay close attention to this matter, and it is completely irresponsible not to have done so, and to be pressing for the enlargement of the Schengen area, contrary to common sense. Lastly, I would like to voice my hope that, when we next meet, at least one of the do-gooder MEPs who are so supportive of the Roma will report that he or she has taken in – they can afford this on an MEP’s salary – a nice Roma family, and are feeding a few extra mouths. It is not hard to show with actions, instead of just with words, that you are a do-gooder. Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to the attacks against the French Government, like those against the Italian Government previously, and also to some very strong attacks against the Commission. These accusations are completely spurious in actual fact. I have not heard any reference to the statistics supplied by the French police authorities showing that, in the 18 months following the exodus of Roma from Bulgaria and Romania, the number of thefts rose by more than 250%. In this connection, perhaps Romania and Bulgaria should be forced to answer some questions, after they were very irresponsibly allowed to enter the European Union without this problem having first been resolved. We must speak frankly to those people, too, who come over as guests of other states. We must tell them to respect the citizens of their host states and not enter their homes illegally and perform acts unbecoming of a guest. They must be respected and they must be protected – in the words of those who speak of high principles – but we must also consider the victims of their crimes: the other honest citizens of the European Union who, perhaps with good reason, do not always enjoy having the Roma as their neighbours. These are the uncomfortable facts that the majority of citizens and people think and that certain do-gooders do not have the courage to admit, because, the truth is, sometimes you also have to have the political courage to say ...

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am very pleased that you are the guardian of the treaties. In actual fact, the Commission also guards the Commission’s own secrets so well that it is very difficult for us MEPs, for example, to obtain extensive and, above all, in-depth information about what takes place behind closed doors in your meetings, despite the fact that the Commissioners have not been elected by our peoples and should therefore feel all the more bound to observe their duty of communication and transparency. For example, I am still waiting for an answer – and not the ironic answer I have been given – to my question so that I can circulate the truth in the newspapers. Is or was President Barroso a member of the Bilderberg Club or not? Does he frequent it or not? The answer I was given, and which I published in my press releases, in other words, was as follows: ‘Mr Borghezio, you know more than us about the Bilderberg Group’ is a little odd, and I would therefore like more information on the subject. For example, what information has the international press given on the background to the financial crisis? The Lisbon strategy was quoted; that is very interesting. It is like looking at a set of Chinese boxes when you come to establish the true owners of the large financial groups to which the leading newspapers and mass media belong; they could be based in tax havens for all we know. I believe that you would do very well to champion an initiative aimed at really disclosing what goes on behind the scenes of politics, finance and the economy. These are very interesting subjects and have widespread relevance to citizens, who have a right to be kept fully informed. I note, and would emphasise, the silence of the left wing with regard to the Bilderberg Club and the Trilateral Commission. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the measures for the supervision of the European financial system must – and this should be better emphasised in the report – have a priority objective, which must be very clear and strongly supported: to establish strict rules to control the derivatives market as this is one of the main causes, if not the main cause, of the current financial crisis. Here, instead, we are, above all, designing a centralised institution, to some extent copied from the model of the ECB. This is not good, because at this point it is not known or fully clear what the role of the national supervisory bodies will be – the Banca d'Italia
 in our country. It seems that they are being watered down somewhat to the role of agent, which is not a particularly well-defined role. Instead, oversight should begin in our countries. In Italy, for example, it happens via a system of local branches which can monitor situations well. Furthermore, why should the headquarters of the European agency be in Frankfurt? Who decided that? Based on what criteria, if not in order – I would say – to make it conformant with the European Central Bank? We propose it be sited in Milan, for example, which is a major financial and banking market, including from a geo-economic point of view due to its position at the centre of Europe. I believe that this plan should generally go much deeper, with measures that require courage to implement, such as introducing a separation between commercial and investment banks in European legislation, based on the principles of the old US law.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, while we are discussing these various issues, there is a lively debate under way in the United States on what I consider to be a crucial question, namely, a return to the principles of the Glass-Steagall Act and the separation of ordinary banks from the speculating banks that caused the extremely serious problems for which our economies and peoples are paying a heavy price. While solutions are being put to us here, 10 days ago, behind closed doors in the secrecy of the Bilderberg Club meetings, a large number of senior bureaucrats and European political leaders came together, probably to lay down instructions for the directives that will subsequently be presented to the European Parliament, which will have no other choice but to consider them. Moreover, this morning I heard Mr Barroso’s appeal to provide aid to our Greek friends. I would not want the aid mainly going to his friend, the shipowner Spiros Latsis. There is a clear conflict of interest here for Mr Barroso, who should account for this. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how long will the euro last in its current form? Are we perhaps headed towards its destructuring within a year or two? I do not agree with creating a new supplementary deficit of EUR 750 billion to cover an earlier one or that these measures are sufficient for building the socio-economic future of 500 million Europeans, nor do I agree with the dogma of saving the euro as it is, because it should be done by keeping the euro as low as possible and reducing the interest rate to inject capital into productive investments for our industries, which are gasping for air, rather than into public financing. I do not agree with the European Commission expecting to review and audit the accounting of Member States’ budgets before the national parliaments: farewell to sovereignty. I disagree with an economic and financial strategy that fails to contemplate specific needs. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, an industrial policy that focuses exclusively on companies operating internationally and using advanced technologies is not the best route to success. We must not forget the whole small and medium enterprise sector, including both small-scale manufacturers and retailers. Innovation policy should be aimed at them also. In particular, this strategy should guarantee conditions that place small and medium-sized enterprises on an equal footing with their competitors outside the EU by adopting safeguard clauses and strong, effective measures to combat the extremely serious problem of counterfeiting, including through effective trade defence instruments. It is important that governance of the Europe 2020 strategy should not rest in the hands of the Commission alone, but should be carried out at different levels, including the national and macro-regional levels. We need to start formulating a policy and strategy that focus on the local level and the reality of manufacturing on the ground, and I would like to stress here the need for attention to be paid to the manufacturing situation in Padania. In other words, we are asking for more attention to be paid to the actual manufacturing situation on the ground, focusing, in particular, on the SME structure, as I said, which is the backbone of manufacturing in every country in Europe and is therefore where the real hope for the future of manufacturing and development of the European Union lies.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that we are here discussing and examining the content of this Europe 2020 strategy, while in Athens workers are dying, and a country, a nation is on the edge of a precipice, paints a rather telling, or, I would go so far as to say, grotesque, picture of European politics. It is absolutely remarkable that in a situation of this kind, the Commission does not feel that it should take a good, long look at itself, because it is not as though it does not realise that this crisis, which in some respects has now reached, I would say, dramatic proportions, is a consequence of many serious mistakes, as demonstrated by the failure of the Lisbon strategy. Many mistakes and one defendant in the dock: the euro. You come here saying, in all your statements, that Greece is a one-off, but will you be saying that when – although let us hope not – another similar situation arises, for example in Spain: will that be another one-off? We here are a bit tired of hearing the one-off excuse: the subprime crisis was also a one-off. It is hard to believe and very difficult to accept what the Commission is saying when the European Union has not yet decided to clean up Europe’s banks and to tell savers, manufacturers and the real economy how much muck there still is in European banks, in order to develop a strategy. We must keep these points in mind and remember that a serious strategy must be based on the real economy, on the small and medium-sized enterprise system, and naturally it must give a responsible role to workers, through their participation, too.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, procedure is one thing: we delegate choices regarding trade policy to the Commission, and that is only right. However, the substance of the matter is something else. What we, the group of the Northern League, representing the regions of Northern Italy, are worried about are the decisions on trade, the progressive reduction of duties, the lack of any industrial policy, and concession of advantages to multinationals. In other words, it is acceptable that Parliament should delegate decisions to the Commission at a technical level, but it is not a good thing that we are slaves and victims of the outdated economic and industrial policy of the World Trade Organisation, which favours the large foreign powers, making no effort to defend our manufacturers. I am not sure if you are aware of the number of small and medium-sized enterprises that are closing in Lombardy and Veneto due to trade agreements that offer no protection to our products. It would be a mistake to believe that research and innovation alone will take us very far. There is a real risk that we will become like the countries of Eastern or Northern Europe, the United States or Asia, where all of the shopping malls now belong to the large multinationals. Therefore, as Parliament, we should delegate the power to adopt these acts regarding trade policy to the Commission, in the hope, however, that the Commission will revise, modernise and defend a manufacturing and trade system that will otherwise disappear.

 With all due respect for your work and that of others, I invite you to come and see for yourself the extent to which agreements with the World Trade Organisation have a positive or negative effect on enterprises in Northern Italy. In half an hour we will be speaking about the Chinese photovoltaic industry. I think that Europe, as it is structured today, counts for little or nothing. I do not know whether the individual states would count for more. What I do know is that the trade policy pursued in this regard by the European Commission is a complete failure for our enterprises. A completely free market is of no use to anyone. Matteo Salvini,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I feel ashamed. While enterprises are closing and workers being made redundant, you come here and tell us we are the most open market in the world and that this investigation will issue its findings in nine months. Somebody here seems to have forgotten why he is being paid a salary by the European taxpayers. If Mr De Gucht says that the trade war is not China’s fault, that is nonetheless an indication that someone has declared war. We can hardly argue with the fact that many enterprises are closing and laying off their workers, or is this not the case in Brussels? Instead of MEPs, I would like to see here today those workers who have lost their jobs and those businesspeople who have seen 30 or 40 or 50 years of work go up smoke for reasons that are obvious to us all. Does anyone here really doubt that China engages in unfair trade, exploits workers, illegally subsidises its enterprises and ignores environmental issues? Does anyone have any questions that cannot be resolved in nine days rather than nine months? I am ashamed to represent a Europe that by the end of this investigation will have no photovoltaic industry left. For some people, the words ‘import duty’ are taboo. Well then certain people should either impose import duties to get things done, or otherwise resign, because nine months is too long to spend investigating the obvious. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by Ms Collin-Langen. The text adopted by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is a balanced text that seems to take account of the real reasons why some of the Directive’s objectives have not been achieved. However, I would have given greater consideration to the impact this crisis has had on citizens and the consequent widespread mistrust of consumer credit. Within the European Union, the situation can vary significantly from Member State to Member State.

 I decided to vote in favour of this report because the measure will simplify the current regulatory framework and will introduce new administrative and technical requirements concerning the environment, safety and market surveillance for two- and three-wheeled vehicles and quadricycles. The issues that, to my mind, require further attention are identification of the scope of the proposal for a regulation to remove some inconsistencies and reflect the categories of manufacture, make the timetable for application simple and clear to prevent problems for manufacturers with having to introduce the new features required by the regulation too quickly, and introduction of environmental requirements that manufacturers do not find it excessively difficult to comply with.

 I decided to vote in favour of this measure because it updates the rules on the type-approval of agricultural and forestry vehicles with a view to ensuring the functioning of the internal market, while at the same time providing for a high level of environmental protection and road safety. One aspect worthy of mention is access to vehicle repair and maintenance information. The justifiable need to provide information for the repair of vehicles has been balanced by the need to protect information valuable to competitors, especially in Asia, who want to copy the best technical solutions in the sector.

 I voted in favour of this report. It is, of course, a text that has undergone only slight amendments and that could be seen merely as an alignment to existing legislation. However, I would like to explain the political importance of this little vote. We should be close to Serbia and be helping its development and growth. I am generally sceptical about this kind of agreement with other countries, but encouraging interchange between the EU and Serbia could prove an important opportunity for both sides.

 I obviously voted in favour of this report. It is a good sign that the European Commission has reached an agreement of this kind, although Moldova is certainly no threat to our geographical indications. We expect efforts to achieve recognition of our products of excellence to be stepped up with other third countries such as the USA and Australia. This should be our objective, though I doubt that Commissioner De Gucht has either the will or the ability to pursue it. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I hardly need to say that the single market has certainly benefited citizens and businesses. For this reason I voted in favour. The problem, however, is that, unlike our competitors such as the US, the trade policy pursued by the European Commission with third countries does not put us in a position to protect our interests. Similarly, the single market cannot be invoked as the solution to every problem in Europe. Often it is actually poorly conceived directives, like the Services Directive, that give our workers and businesses enormous problems. Bring on the single market, but let it not be an instrument designed solely around the needs of multinationals. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted against this proposal and I am pleased that there was a majority of MEPs who shared my position. The relevant committee for this matter asked the Council to present a female candidate and, having been ignored, reacted negatively to the recommendation to appoint Yves Mersch as a Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB). I do not have sufficient information to say whether Mr Mersch deserves this post or not, but I cannot fail to take into consideration the fact that appointing a man would mean that there would be no women on the ECB’s Executive Board until 2018. I am also very sceptical of the procedure used. It is degrading for Parliament merely to have to ratify decisions made elsewhere. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted in favour of this provision. Some European Court of Justice rulings and the strict rules imposed by the World Trade Organisation severely restrict our freedom to legislate to protect European industry and workers against counterfeit goods and goods produced without respect for social and environmental standards. For this reason I hope that the European institutions’ agenda of work on this sensitive subject will no longer be controlled by the rulings or dictates of globalisation, but by a serious trade and industrial policy.

 I voted against this resolution, despite the fact that the Committee on International Trade has produced an interesting text that picks up on many of the most important issues in relations between the EU and Japan.

My opposition to an agreement that removes tariffs between Europe and Japan is total and unconditional. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has been awarded a Nobel Prize, no less! If only its citizens could hear some of the speeches made in this Parliament. Where is all this dialogue, this respect for human rights and tolerance? I hope that the Commission presses ahead with its project that from a technical, economic and social point of view is useful for dialogue, useful to consumers, useful to enterprises and useful to workers in Israel, be they Jews, Christians or Muslims. Israel has provided us with a model to strive for and to compete with in terms of pharmaceutical research, The sad thing is that we do not hear the same kind of indignation in this House from hypocritical left-wing parties when human rights are ignored in other parts of the world, in North Africa, in the Middle East. You can continue this Israel-Palestine derby all you like, but nobody will ever win it. I hope that this agreement will be a small contribution to peace in the area. I think that anyone who votes against the proposal should be ashamed of themselves. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted in favour of the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2008/106/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum level of training of seafarers. The proposed amendments aim to ensure improved standards for issuance and recognition of certificates of maritime training issued by states that are parties to the Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention), new criteria for determining medical fitness of crews and stricter measures to prevent fraudulent practices. The proposal also addresses recognition of seafarers’ certificates by the European Maritime Safety Agency, extending the deadline for the procedure of recognition of third countries’ STCW systems from three to 18 months.

 I voted in favour of the recommendation on the draft Council Decision on the conclusion of a Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the State of Israel, of the other part, on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products. Under this agreement some of the benefits of the internal market would be extended to aligned sectors and facilitate access to the Israeli market, removing technical barriers to trade for industrial products. The Protocol will allow EU exporters, if they so choose, to test and certify their industrial products subject to the same aligned requirements and standards, and then to have access to the Israeli market without having to comply with any further conformity assessment certification procedure.

I voted in favour of the report on trade relations with the United States by Mr Moreira. The US is undoubtedly an important trading partner for Italy and Italian exporters, although I urge the European Commission to make greater efforts to protect Italian interests on the question of indications of origin. I therefore particularly welcome the report’s emphasis on the need to resolve this issue. Other important questions are also dealt with, such as removal of trade barriers, the introduction of measures to ensure better market access, including for investment, the protection of intellectual property rights, the opening up of public procurement markets to ensure full reciprocity and convergence on mutual recognition of regulatory standards.

 I decided to vote against the report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council introducing emergency autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan because I think, frankly, that it is absurd. I cannot understand the need to come up with such a complex and laborious regulation because, in just a few years’ time and without any great upheaval, Pakistan will benefit from the trade preferences established in the recent reform of the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+) system, which I voted against. Moreover, this regulation provides for the total elimination of customs for a list of 75 tariff lines that relate almost exclusively to the textile sector, which will have a devastating impact on the industrial make-up of northern Italy.

 I supported the legislative proposal on European standardisation tabled by Lara Comi as it set itself the important goal of amending a whole series of guidelines in a technical field, standardisation, that is of great importance for the business world. Following this measure, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will be directly involved in developing new standards owing to the lower access rates. In addition, in the process of drawing up standards, there is also room for consumers through their associations. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I decided to vote against the report on the amended proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards electronic identification of bovine animals and deleting the provisions on voluntary beef labelling. In fact, I believe it is wrong to abolish the labelling system, which is optional, blaming administrative burdens that each farmer can optionally decide whether or not they wish to incur. On the contrary, such a labelling system has proved to be effective, enabling consumers to make informed choices regarding their purchases, by ensuring that additional information is provided in a harmonised and certified manner. Its abolition would favour less transparent producers. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted in favour of Mr Susta’s report. These openings by Russia, even if due to its imminent accession to the World Trade Organisation, are clearly good news.

 This agreement with Russia is positive and I wholeheartedly voted in favour. I hope, though, that these events help the Commission understand that the Union must consider providing at least the same level of protection for its own industrial system as our international partners do. This agreement is positive, but it does not resolve the difficulties that our companies in the sector have faced and are still facing in order to be able to continue production in Europe. The Commission must listen to their needs and safeguard jobs in the 27 Member States of the Union. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 Raw materials are one of the most sensitive issues. It is a good thing for the EU to negotiate with Russia, one of the largest holders of natural raw materials, in order to guarantee vital procurement for our industry.

 I voted against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). One of those most responsible for this blow to the Union’s credibility is Commissioner De Gucht. I believe that, instead of insisting on this agreement, he should have resigned. On several occasions, Parliament asked to have the issue of geographical indications included in ACTA, but Commissioner De Gucht was not able to negotiate this with his counterparts. The doubts over the infringement of fundamental rights are too serious to approve such an agreement. The fight against counterfeiting deserves bespoke measures and above all the involvement of those countries, particularly Asian countries, which bear the most responsibility for this huge disaster for our businesses.

I voted for the report by Mr Creutzmann. I believe that it is necessary for the customs checks system to be equipped with rules that are up to date with the current situation and new problems. Combating counterfeiting is an extremely important element for the protection and promotion of employment, creativity and consumer protection in Europe. In my view, the many amendments tabled by the left, seeking to reduce the rigour necessary for a customs system that will protect our economy, were very negative. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted firmly for this report. European car manufacturers claim they are ready to take on the challenge of incorporating this type of equipment in the vehicles they produce. This will have the result of saving human lives. However, I should not like the European Parliament to go too far, perhaps by proposing to extend eCall to other types of vehicle too rapidly. In current circumstances, that would amount to excessive costs for manufacturers and would probably not have the effect of improving road safety. As regards ordinary cars, I remain in favour, and I hope that these devices will soon be launched on the market. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 Mr Ransdorf’s report seems balanced. This is why I have voted in favour.

Europe can do much in this regard. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as usual, I fear that someone is wasting your time and trying to hoodwink citizens, entrepreneurs and Internet users in Europe, in Italy and, as far as I am concerned, in Padania. We are debating an agreement involving just a handful of countries, one that excludes 95% of countries engaged in exporting counterfeit goods, so effectively it is much ado about nothing. The Commissioner talks about defending businesses and jobs, and then goes and signs free trade agreements with Morocco, Korea, Pakistan and India. We remove tariffs, barriers and protections to help banks, insurance companies and multinationals from Northern Europe, and then try to muzzle the web by selling it as a way of defending our businesses. No one is falling for it any more, Commissioner. Go and inspect the ports in northern Europe, the port of Rotterdam for example, if you want to fight counterfeiting; do not try and gag anyone. If you really want to do something tangible about it, take the first plane to China, India or Indonesia and bring home something tangible, or else resign. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted in favour of this report. This is a big step forward in protecting people with coeliac disease. The Commission’s proposal has been improved by the Members’ amendments, especially those by Italian Members. There is profound ignorance about coeliac disease in various Member States: it is neither a fad, nor an allergy. Coeliac disease is an illness and the words ‘gluten free’ on food products cannot be trivialised as a simple claim or allergen. Coeliacs cannot eat any gluten whatsoever. It will be important if the excellent rapporteur is able to defend the improvements made to the text and oppose any deleterious proposals made by the Council. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 The motion for a resolution, which is the result of the work carried out by the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, is very interesting and contains references which I believe will be useful in helping the Commission understand possible future single market scenarios. However I voted against the resolution because I believe there are premises in the text that are wrong. Rating the single market too highly as a solution to the crisis or claiming that its completion would automatically lead to growth throughout the Union means saying things that are not true. Our companies need the single market, but the reasons for the crisis are to be found elsewhere and are much more deep-seated and serious. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted against Mr Fjellner’s report, even though the Commission’s proposal is, without doubt, an improvement on the previous scheme of generalised tariff preferences, and despite the fact that the Council introduced a number of additional restrictions for the GSP+ scheme during negotiations with Parliament. Unfortunately, however, a country such as Pakistan – a serious threat to EU textile businesses, which continue to hold strong – would soon be able to benefit from the GSP+ scheme. I do not think that is a good thing. We ought to have further limited access to these trade preferences. That is why Lega Nord

 I voted in favour of this resolution. Parliament must be able to influence the mandate it will receive from the Commission to negotiate with Japan.

 The resolution on the trade agreement with Colombia and Peru poses some serious questions. Can the Commission continue to make concessions to countries that blatantly violate human rights? As such, I voted in favour. I would emphasise that the trade agreement on which we will shortly have to decide represents a real threat to the EU’s agriculture and fisheries sectors.

 I obviously voted in favour of the report. On the very day of the terrible events that affected Liguria and Tuscany a few months ago, I submitted an urgent question to the European Commission to draw attention to the tragedy, occurring, in particular, in Genoa, the Cinque Terre region and neighbouring areas. I voted with the moving images of the altruistic spirit of the ‘Angels of the Mud’ who helped the affected populations still fresh in my mind, and with the memory of my sorrow for those who, in those dreadful days, lost their lives or a loved one still vivid.

 The mobilisation of funds to help the regions affected by the tragic events in Liguria is a necessity. The European Union Solidarity Fund is a very important instrument that brings Europeans much closer together than many political or legislative initiatives. When casting my vote in favour, my thoughts turned to those people who were bereaved and lost everything in the floods. Given that these events are happening more and more frequently, I think that the time has come, in collaboration with the European Commission, to establish a programme to identify suitable instruments with which to invest in innovation and prevention in Europe.

 I voted in favour of the report. I think it is right that at last we have a general legislative instrument valid for any future macro-financial assistance for third countries. I supported the main proposals made by the rapporteur, even though I did not share his concern regarding the need to involve our Parliament more fully in future measures of macro-financial assistance. In my opinion, the procedure initially proposed by the European Commission, which provided for the involvement of the Council but not of the European Parliament could have been maintained. However, the members of the Committee on International Trade preferred to bring in changes that will make negotiations with the Council very long and difficult to resolve. I express my hope, in any case, that the rapporteur will be successful in the negotiations with the colegislator. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted for the report and I congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work. The problems that China creates for our production system are well known: for many years now, my political movement, Lega Nord
, has been expressing its concern over the relocation of our enterprises to Asia, the social dumping that adversely affects our workers, and the risks associated with the arrival on our territory of products that are dangerous and do not comply with our rules. For these reasons, it is right that the European Commission should make a serious, concrete commitment to demanding reciprocity and setting in motion a genuine strategy to protect our production system and revitalise a genuine industrial policy.

 I want to vote against this measure and I would like to explain the political reasons that led me to make this decision. We need to give a signal to the European Commission so that it will represent us effectively at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Yet another European defeat in a dispute with China at the WTO would today force Parliament to delete an article in our Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation. It is wrong not to stand up more strongly to international bodies like the WTO. It is wrong not to defend our industry. It is wrong not to ask China for reciprocal openings for our products and services. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 My vote in favour of this measure is not just a duty. In actual fact, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules require the European Union to remove the rules imposing restrictions on the import of products from other members of the WTO. Since Russia has now become a member of the WTO, unless we had voted to repeal certain rules today, we would have been subject to certain sanctions which would have damaged our production and our businesses.

 I voted with absolute conviction against this report. I understand Mr Rinaldi’s position, but I do not share his enthusiastically positive stance on the outcomes of the so-called Arab Spring. I do not agree on his call for the creation of a free trade area with the countries of North Africa, which would seriously damage our textiles industry and agriculture, which have already been hampered by an unprecedented crisis. Lastly, I do not approve of the general tone of the report, which focuses exclusively on protecting and promoting the interests of the other party, while completely forgetting to refer to and defend legitimate EU trading interests. It seems more like a report by the Committee on Development than one by the Committee on International Trade. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted in favour of this agreement, as I did for the similar measure relating to Liberia. However, I remain doubtful about the actual possibility of its implementation by the Central African Republic. The European Commission will be responsible for monitoring in order to ensure that the forestry heritage of this country does not suffer irreversible damage and that a stop is put to illegal logging, a real scourge afflicting the entire African continent. In any case, my vote in favour was also meant as a vote of faith in the two parties to the agreement.

 I am delighted to vote in favour of this agreement. However, I have doubts about Liberia’s actual ability to respect the commitment it has made with Europe.

 I voted in favour of these amendments to the European Fisheries Fund. The measure will involve no cost to the EU because the funds advanced to Member States in economic difficulties will be offset before the end of the programme.

 I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for her success in proposing numerous amendments within the Committee on International Trade to a proposal from the Commission that contained some highly unacceptable passages such as the extension of time limits for reaching the decision to introduce trade duties. These actions are necessary in order to safeguard our production system and therefore require speed, not more bureaucracy or time-wasting.

 I voted in favour of this resolution because it is always necessary to underline the fact that trade with our international partners must always take place in a context of respect for human rights.

 I voted for this report. The text lists many of the problems relating to the application of the rules on waste management. The references to respect for the principle of subsidiarity are quite correct, as – even more so – are the references to the major interests that see the Mafia and organised crime in general involved in waste disposal, especially in some regions. Everyone is monitoring the situation in Campania, but we must also underline that in Italy – especially in northern regions around the Po, but also in some cases in the South – there are instances of excellent management of the waste cycle, which can set an example for the whole of Europe. In order to achieve these results, it is very important that local citizens improve their selection of local politicians. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 As I already mentioned in yesterday’s debate, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Cutaș. However, I demand that the European Commission should act on this important vote and quickly exert all necessary pressure on the government of Uzbekistan to put paid to the use of children in the cotton harvest. Europe cannot enter into agreements with countries that act in such a way. Cotton is a very important raw material for the textiles industry in my Padania.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we will support this report and we thank the rapporteur for his work. I am the seventh or eighth person to take the floor to say the same thing. If the Commission really believes that what we debate in Parliament counts for something, it should take action tomorrow, not with a report, or a threat, or a proposal for a measure. If it is true, and here the whole House is saying the same thing, from left to right – that thousands of children are forcibly sent to work in the cotton fields (and I think that the evidence now proves that it is so), then we vote in favour of this report. Yet if, tomorrow morning, no practical action against the government of Uzbekistan is taken by the European Commission, it will mean that we have lost, and we have wasted our time here tonight, as well as helping to destroy the credibility of Parliament, the Commission and the European institutions, and that we have several hundred thousand children on our consciences. Children who, if the debate continues so slowly, will continue next year to do what they have been forced to do for decades. Therefore, we support this report. However, I hope that at eight, when the debate ends, and with tomorrow’s vote, the problem will not be shelved, and I hope that the Commission will act, today rather than tomorrow.

 I voted for this report. The rapporteur, Mr Sturdy, and the Committee on International Trade (INTA) have done excellent work. In any case, it is right to emphasise that certain states may raise barriers to legitimately protect their own economy and their own consumers. Of course, the text is lacking one important consideration which is that at some point, even the European Union might need to start protecting its own fabric of production rather than limiting itself to only requesting reductions in duties and the removal of non-tariff barriers. In my opinion, a real trade policy should not limit itself to this alone and should consider the interests of European small and medium-sized enterprises first and foremost. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I would like to explain my vote in favour of the report on the modernisation of customs, because this is an important and much-needed text that enables the Commission to postpone the entry into force of a regulation adopted in 2008 and slated for implementation in 2013. Our delegation would have preferred to purge the text of references to the non-preferential origin principle, which we do not support, has nothing to do with the text of the report, and which we will fight if it is put forward again during the debate on the legislative proposal.

 I would like to declare my vote in favour of Ms McClarkin’s report on the implementation of the Professional Qualifications Directive. There is no doubt that the ability to carry out one’s profession in all Member States is a significant feature of the internal market. It is important to implement the quite correct precautions outlined in the report in regard to the health care sector, third-country professional qualifications and the need for a high level of linguistic competence, particularly for some professional categories whose work involves being in close contact with patients or clients.

 The purpose of this text is to provide a right and necessary basis for guiding the Commission on consumer protection. It is a complex and important issue that thus requires further consideration in the future. The report has brought to light important principles such as the importance of the consumer’s role in developing EU policies and the dissatisfaction being shown by citizens, with increasing concerns over sectors such as finance and insurance. Mr Triantaphyllides’ report also includes important points on the need to bolster consumer protection in sectors which are currently growing quickly, such as e-commerce.

 I would like to express my vote in favour of Mr Creutzmann’s report. The online gambling market is in a state of continual growth and its turnover has now exceeded EUR 10 billion. For these reasons, the issue of protecting consumers, specifically those who are weaker and more at risk, is extremely delicate and important. At the same time, we must ensure that the revenue generated for Member States through taxation of online gambling is not curtailed by the worrying presence of illegal gambling games which, other than providing an opportunity to launder enormous sums of illegally obtained money, place less cautious consumers in grave danger. I believe that it is of fundamental importance to ensure that national regulators work in close collaboration with each other. Greater exchange of information across Europe could prevent cases whereby unregulated providers exploit regulatory gaps and play national regulatory bodies off against each other. For this reason, the Commission and the Member States should take immediate steps to protect European consumers from bogus providers. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for having made such a complex subject and report accessible to everyone. I welcome the document, as it invites the Commission to simplify and safeguard the different legal practices in the various Member States, as well as the refusal to introduce new rules for tenders below European thresholds. Furthermore, the report dedicates a lot of space to the protection of small and medium-sized enterprises in respect of their ability to access European contract tenders. Finally, I would like to underline that simplifying legislative procedures not only offers many advantages to local administrators; it also helps to eradicate the wasting of funds. I therefore invite the Commission to continue along this route towards improving legal clarity. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

I would like to explain my strong opposition to this report, not just for the specific topic discussed in the text – the mutual evaluation tool, in relation to which, despite the delays and inconsistencies, it is possible to discern some positive aspects – but to the Commission’s attitude to such a complex issue. Unfortunately, in fact, the report only examines a marginal part of the Services Directive that is of little importance. Meanwhile, it fails to address the serious problems that the directive is causing, such as the lack of consumer protection, the little autonomy left to local authorities, and the calling into question of small manufacturing operations on which entire families have depended for generations.

I feel duty-bound to vote in favour of renewing trade preferences with Balkan countries, including Serbia, that currently have a stabilisation and association agreement in place with the European Union. Firstly, I feel this way on the basis of the Commission’s favourable take on simplifying commercial agreements with countries, such as China, that do not have association agreements with the European Union and whose products often undermine our competitiveness. Secondly, the text on which we reached final agreement offers the possibility of limiting the damage that allowing access for these goods could cause to our market. Matteo Salvini,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a snapshot of a disaster: it talks about a strategy for Europe, but we see no strategy. It is a snapshot of a hopeless disaster. Thank you for the report, which offers no way out at all. Somebody will have to explain to me what the Commission’s farsightedness entails. The details put forward here actually portray a debacle of what Europe is not. The prevailing interests are those of certain Northern European countries that want to liberalise everything and trade, regardless of social dumping and the imbalances we have with our so-called partners, but without any interest or protection for our small and medium-sized enterprises. It is essentially British and German interests that are being defended both by the Commission and by the report. I smile when I see in the report that the Member States and the Commission are being urged to communicate better, since the people of the European Union are sick to death of globalisation because of the loss of productivity. If, in your view, we can solve things by communicating better, then we really have not understood where to go.Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Enlargement is a very complex question and should be analysed from all points of view, from economic considerations to geopolitical repercussions and potential social impact. Above all at a time of economic crisis I think that it is advisable to be as prudent as possible and to learn from the mistakes of the past. I do not share the rapporteur’s view that the EU should launch a campaign in favour of enlargement in the candidate countries, since I do not believe that enlargement has proved successful in all cases or that visa liberalisation has always proved beneficial. For these reasons I did not vote in favour of the proposal. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I would like to congratulate Mr Kelam for his work on a relatively new problem for the EU, but which will be increasingly important in the future. Cyberspace brings new challenges in an ever more interconnected and globalised world. A global and coordinated approach is needed to face these challenges at EU level through the development of a comprehensive EU cyber security strategy within the framework of a wider ranging cooperation with the US, with Brazil, Russia, India and China, and with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.

 Italy applied for financial assistance from the EU Solidarity Fund following the series of earthquakes that struck on 20 May 2012. A heavy earthquake with a magnitude of 5.9 on the Richter scale affected wide parts of Northern Italy and caused severe damage in many towns and villages, in particular around the epicentre, mostly in the provinces of Modena and Ferrara in the region of Emilia-Romagna. On 29 May, a second strong earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 on the Richter scale occurred with the epicentre slightly to the west. Both events were followed by several serious aftershocks. The earthquakes caused 27 deaths, an estimated 350 people were injured and over 45 000 people had to be evacuated. The Italian authorities estimated total damage at EUR 13 273 736 063. Despite the financial difficulties affecting the 2012 budget, I think it is necessary and right for Parliament to send a signal to the victims of these disasters to help them at this difficult time.

 I support the adoption of this trade Protocol between the EU and Israel, not just because Israel offers an interesting development opportunity to our enterprises in the fishery and agricultural sectors, but more particularly because I am opposed to exploiting trade relations with Israel for political ends. Bringing political pressure to bear in matters of trade on the one hand damages the interests of our enterprises and on the other gives an increasingly one-sided image of the EU in the Middle-Eastern conflict, undermining its credibility. I hope that this protocol, like the Agreements on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of industrial products, will be approved as quickly as possible. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 The conflict between Israel and Hamas and other terrorist factions operating in Gaza is asymmetric. On the one hand there is a state that has the right and the duty, like any other state, to protect its citizens from the over 5 000 missiles and rockets launched since 2005, and on the other a terrorist organisation the aim of which is the destruction of the State of Israel, deliberately targeting civilians in order to terrorise the population. The situation is even more worrying if we consider the military and financial support provided by Iran to Hamas and the ambiguous role played by the new Egypt, in which the Muslim Brotherhood is increasingly influential. To forget these facts and turn the victim into the aggressor is not only to encourage extremism but also to allow extremists to voice the claims of the Palestinian people. It is unrealistic to believe that peace can be achieved with Hamas. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I support Mr Bové’s report on promoting the tastes of Europe. Farmers, and especially small-scale farmers, increasingly need aid and legal instruments to cope with global competition in agricultural markets both within the EU and internationally. I think the policy to promote local markets through the development of products with low food miles and information about origin and quality is particularly important for guaranteeing better incomes for farmers. This approach could prove particularly important in mountainous areas where in-quota agriculture is one of the most important ways of preventing the abandonment and degradation of the land and the environment.

 I agree with Ms Costa’s motion on protecting children in the digital world. It has been calculated that children spend up to 40 hours a week in front of the television and are online for 88 minutes a day.

I am therefore convinced of the need to protect them from harmful and violent content, as well as violations of their privacy, through European legislation on the subject. Fiorello Provera,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ‘obscenity’ is the Taliban’s accusation against the 14-year-old Malala, who asked to go to school and for the right to education for girls in Pakistan, and the accusation of obscenity is the excuse to strike Malala down with two shots from a firearm, one to the head and the other to the shoulder. The Taliban’s attack not only has religious or political motivations, but aims to suppress and wipe out fundamental human rights and deny women dignity and the right to education. Such is the culture and lifestyle model the Taliban propose to the Muslim world, with utter contempt for their own lives and the lives of others. We obviously condemn these cowardly and cruel acts, but we would like ‘moderate’ Islam as a whole to raise its voice with us, to condemn these criminals. To remain silent would mean agreeing and conniving, and that is intolerable. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again when we discuss relations between the EU and Israel, this House has divided along ideological lines and dragged a technical agreement into the area of political opposition, ignoring its content. The agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) is not an upgrading of relations between the EU and Israel; this is not an international legal measure defining frontiers and establishing rights of sovereignty. The legal services of Parliament and the Commission have approved it, underlining that the ACAA with Israel does not go beyond the existing legal framework. This is a technical agreement that will allow many European citizens easier access to quality medicinal products at a lower price, with considerable savings for our national health services. Italy will save about EUR 1 billion annually, a considerable sum in these difficult economic times. I therefore think that this agreement should be supported. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Under the Geneva agreement, Russia too has accepted the need for a compromise based on a transition process agreed by the government and by the rebels, whereby the opposition and Mr Assad’s regime would have to share power. At this point it is important to ensure opposition unity on a shared political platform, at least on some key points. We must avoid the Balkanisation of the conflict and its degeneration into combat between ethnic or religious groups. The future must bring a secular, democratic and tolerant Syrian society. Unfortunately, however, there has been recent news of attacks on the Christian community, which fuels fears of possible persecution by a new theocratic and Islamic fundamentalist regime in Syria. Europe must do everything it can to ensure that what happens in Egypt with the Coptic Christian community or in Libya between the various clans also happens in Syria. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have said, this is a protocol of a technical nature relating to the production of pharmaceutical products, and has already been negotiated by the Commission and approved by the Council in 2010. It cannot be considered as an upgrade of relations with Israel, as Baroness Ashton declared here in Parliament. The Commission has also stated that no changes are needed to this agreement and, moreover, the high quality of the medicinal products involved and the economic benefits for national health care systems have been confirmed. The Italian health care system, for example, would save millions of euro in patient care costs. My conviction is that in fact, opposition to this agreement is of a purely political nature, with the aim of boycotting Israel. Those who oppose this agreement for political reasons should therefore also oppose trade agreements with China, which is occupying Tibet, with Russia, occupying part of Georgia, Armenia, occupying Nagorno-Karabakh, and with any states guilty of serious human rights violations, which amounts to two-thirds of humanity.

 The appointment of a European Representative for Human Rights is intended to increase the visibility of European policy in this area. Greater visibility also means greater accountability and the need to report regularly to Parliament on this especially sensitive subject. I support this initiative. Appointing a Special Representative for Human Rights will enable the EU human rights strategy and the associated action plan to be implemented more effectively, by formulating recommendations, by stepping up dialogue with third countries, international, regional and non-governmental organisations active in this sector, by fostering overall coherence in EU action on human rights, and by integrating this dimension across all areas of the Union’s external action.

 Many people would like to see a new role for European policy in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We all want Europe to promote more effective peace initiatives than have happened so far and to take on a political role more in tune with our financial commitments in the area. To achieve that in such a complicated and difficult situation, the European Union must be seen as credible and unbiased by both parties. Both the Palestinians and the Israelis must be convinced that the Union is only interested in peace and is not prejudiced against either side. Do we really think that the European Union can be regarded as a credible partner by Israel in light of the recent consensual positions reached by the Foreign Affairs Council last May, which totally ignored Israel’s legitimate security demands, surrounded as it is by hostile countries? At a time when the hopes raised by the Arab Spring are being dashed and we see Islamic extremism prevailing in the Maghreb countries, what security assurances can be given by the new Palestinian state if it comes into being, which, by the way, is what we all hope will happen?

Mr President, I will not repeat what has already been said on the territorial dispute and on the energy issue at the root of the conflict. The result is that an agreed separation between the two States, recognised by the international community, is degenerating into a large-scale armed conflict. Another tragic result is that in the Blue Nile region, controlled by the Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement, Sudan is blocking humanitarian aid destined for 200 000 people. As well as providing humanitarian aid, I would like to see Europe conducting a policy that is more committed to supporting the African Union, and not so much in opposition to the Chinese presence or influence in the area, but in order to strengthen pan-African politics and ensure that Africa belongs, a little more, to Africans.

 I would like to thank Ms de Sarnez for her in-depth and meticulous analysis of trade relations between the European Union and China. The results of indiscriminately opening the European market to Chinese goods are there for all to see: relocations and massive job losses in Europe; average annual Chinese growth of 9% while European countries suffer a serious recession; the impotence of European trade policy; and not forgetting that 83% of counterfeit goods seized at the EU’s external borders come from China.

 The economic crisis currently affecting Europe is so serious that it is necessary to take more decisive action to protect our industry and our small and medium-sized enterprises, especially when they are subject to dumping or other unfair conduct by operators in countries where there is no rule of law and the safeguarding of social and environmental rights is effectively non-existent. The fact that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has decided to accept a claim from China against the already rather unambitious anti-dumping regulation in force in Europe is, instead, a step in the other direction, which makes it harder to safeguard our businesses and our jobs. Therefore, I cannot agree with the content of this regulation, which could further compound the difficulties of our businesses. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 The Commission should not underestimate the importance of ‘regional airports’, which are distinct from ‘hub airports’ in that their function is mainly tied to the area in which they are located. Unfortunately, these airports are increasingly neglected by EU legislation and have been given secondary importance in recent proposals on the development of the EU transport network. I share Mr Bradbourn’s stance on the monopolisation of many regional airports by individual airlines and their isolation by the transport network. We need to block unfair practices, such as the ‘one bag’ rule imposed by airlines, which cuts passenger spending in airports by up to 70%, with repercussions on the local economies linked to regional airports.

 Mr Rinaldi’s report is very ambitious and gives us a chance to reflect on the effects – and also the causes – of the so-called ‘Arab Spring’. In contrast to the rapporteur, however, I think the view that has been set out is too optimistic and that many of the proposed measures are more pertinent to development cooperation than to international trade. The growing instability and increasingly extremist political trends which are increasingly being seen in countries such as Egypt and Libya prevent me from sharing in the overall feeling of confidence over the so-called ‘Arab Spring’ and the rather premature comparison, in my view, with the fall of the Berlin Wall. The ‘more for more’ principle should be at the heart of EU policy on Mediterranean countries and any increase in European contributions ought to be dependent on real reforms designed to bring about thoroughgoing democracy in these countries. Only then will we be able to discuss a possible review of tariff barriers. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, freedom of worship seems increasingly in danger and, in particular, cases of discrimination and persecution against Christians are becoming increasingly widespread in the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, recently in Nigeria, in South-East Asia, China, India, Pakistan and North Korea. In these countries, there are numerous cases of forced emigration, attacks and arson against places of worship and religious structures, torture and killings, kidnappings and forced conversions. Not less than 10% of Christians around the world, in other words, 200 million people, are minorities in their own countries and potential victims of discrimination. Religious freedom is a fundamental human right, as we all know, but both the European Union and international human rights organisations are, unfortunately, still not very effective at reporting violations and protecting this right. I therefore wish to reiterate the proposal already advanced on other occasions, to set up a specific, accurate, and annual report by the European Parliament to monitor the status of religious freedom in the world and strongly denounce violations where they exist.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what I hope we can do is draw up a thorough report on any violation of freedom of worship, wherever it occurs, and whatever religion is prevented from being upheld, practised or pursued by anyone in the world. Not a discriminatory report against any one religion, but a report that starts from acknowledging the growing number of attacks on Christians around the world, which are becoming more severe and more numerous, as I have already said. I believe, given that this Parliament regards the protection of human rights and of all human rights as fundamental, that the protection of religious rights is perhaps the most fundamental, since they are based not only on human needs but on morals, and therefore we must be united in defending them, and in doing so, we are consistent with the objectives of this Parliament and are consistent with the defence of human rights, which has repeatedly been hailed around the world as a victory for civilisation.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Kosovo is a country with enormous structural problems, as highlighted by the report itself. Chronic and widespread corruption, a judicial system that does not respond to the needs of a democratic country, a highly inefficient public administration, a serious lack of media freedom, insufficient protection of minorities even as regards cultural and religious traditions. Furthermore, the economy is very weak and environmental protection is neglected. On top of all this, crime syndicates are widespread, trafficking arms, people and drugs, as verified by international investigations and reported by authoritative media organisations. In 2010, the Council of Europe also denounced the involvement of Prime Minister Thaçi in organ smuggling and other criminal activities. All of this shows that we are a long way from any suggestion of possible integration, even though we have a duty to accompany Kosovo in its social and democratic development.

 I am against the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia joining the European Union in the immediate future. I agree with the rapporteur’s view that there has been some progress – in fact, important progress; you just have to look at the latest elections, the economic reforms and at the end of the Parliamentary boycott. However, I am puzzled at the idea of accession, because there is still too great a distance between the social and political institutions of this Balkan state and those of the EU Member States. The rushed accession of a country in which there is separation and mistrust between ethnic groups could create a breeding ground for tensions within the EU and slow down the process by which the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia moves towards becoming a pluralist society.

There are still too many question marks about the real authority of the Balkan state. There are too many concerns about the effective independence of the judicial system, which is an indispensable requirement for guaranteeing the rule of law. Finally, too many criticisms can be levelled at the country with regard to its economy. In order for the European Union to be a driver of growth and political stability, it is fundamental that there should be a certain level of convergence between Member States, and Bosnia and Herzegovina does not currently have this.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have seen, the persecutions and killings of Christians are continuing on a wide scale in Nigeria. The latest official data says that the Boko Haram armed group, which wants to convert the country to Islam, has killed 1 200 Christians in the last two years and forced 35 000 Christians to flee the country. However, in some Arab countries, too, like Egypt and Iraq, millions of Christians are discriminated against, even killed or forced into exile. There is a sort of growing religious racism against Christians that is being accepted almost with resignation or fatalism. In this situation, the international institutions, including Europe, and important political and religious figures must make their voices heard loud and strong and call upon governments to face their responsibilities. I should add that I would also like to see the so-called moderate Islamic citizens, who quite rightly reject extremism, join us in defending the rights of their Christian fellow citizens. To return to Nigeria, we have mentioned the widespread poverty, the high levels of poverty of so many millions of people in this extraordinarily rich country that could so easily provide amply for all its citizens. As Ms Sargentini says, there is a problem and that is corruption, which is so widespread and pervasive that it has altered the social structures of the country. With corruption, there is no respect for the environment, no free market, no opportunities for trade or young people, and therefore, ultimately, there is no democracy either. In actual fact, Nigeria needs a proper, qualified, extremely honest ruling class, and without this, it cannot really be considered a modern country or a democratic country. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I am in favour of many of the ideas proposed by Mr Saryusz-Wolski on the issue of relations with the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa): the idea that the EU should have its own global, comprehensive approach on the issue; the idea that the growing role of emerging countries, in particular, the BRICS, should be fully acknowledged within the framework of rules and values, above all, those enshrined in the United Nations Charter; the idea that parliamentary diplomacy can contribute decisively to the development of amicable relations, especially in those countries in which parliamentarianism is becoming established; lastly, the idea that developing full political relations with the emerging world must not disregard crucial issues such as the environment, human rights and labour conditions. By contrast, I have great doubts about the request for visa liberalisation with Brazil.

 I agree with and support the conclusions in Mr Watson’s report. The EU is now the world’s biggest market and the largest donor of development aid. It represents a unique opportunity for promoting human rights and respect for the rules of peaceful coexistence of the community of Member States. Unfortunately, thus far, the cumbersome red tape surrounding the EU’s restrictive measures against regimes that do not respect international law, and the failure of such measures to feed into one another, have meant that they have not always had the desired effect as deterrents and sanctions. It is unjust that sometimes, peoples that are already oppressed or European companies and citizens should have suffered the consequences of sanctions, while the corrupt, violent local elites have managed to evade them. In the same way, it is equally unjust that third countries take and have taken advantage of European respect for the rule of law and fundamental rights. I therefore join Mr Watson in calling for the Council to adopt, as soon as possible, clear rules – to be applied uniformly and subject to periodic review – that will enable the restrictive measures to be more effective.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, the Arab Spring has led not only to political changes but also to new challenges and threats to stability. One of these is the growing phenomenon of arms smuggling. Since the fall of Gaddafi in Libya, the Egyptian authorities have been reporting a sharp increase in arms smuggling in the Sinai Peninsula. Surface-to-air missiles, rockets and anti-aircraft guns have been stolen from army barracks abandoned by Libyan forces and now supply a black market for weapons, destined for the Gaza Strip and Hamas in particular. This is a very worrying phenomenon because these arms are capable of shooting down civilian aircraft during take-off and landing and may end up in the hands of terrorist groups such as Al-Qaida, for example in the Maghreb. How, I ask, can we help to mitigate this growing threat and who are our potential allies? Fiorello Provera

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, it is difficult to be optimistic. If Tehran were to have nuclear weapons, it would seriously destabilise the area between the Mediterranean and the Caucasus and could trigger a nuclear arms race in neighbouring countries that for various reasons are afraid of Tehran, such as Saudi Arabia or Turkey. The latest Iranian Shahab-3 missiles can reach EU Member States such as Greece, Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria, and would make the Tehran regime’s threat to destroy the State of Israel possible. A nuclear Iran really could block the Strait of Hormuz, making any political or military countermeasures extremely risky. We cannot afford a new North Korea in the Middle East.

I agree with, and strongly support, the conclusions of Mr Patriciello on the European space strategy, in their expression both of appreciation and of concern. There is no doubt that space policy is a great opportunity for Europe because it stimulates technological innovation, because it helps to make European citizens more secure, because it creates synergies in a strategic civil and military sector, and, finally, because it creates jobs for highly qualified workers. It is therefore right that the project should play a key role in the Europe 2020 strategy. That said, it is all too plain that in terms of governance, the Commission could and should have drawn up a more ambitious plan. The failure to include it in the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020 risks undermining the investments made so far.

 I support the balanced report by Mr Cutaş. Strengthening relations between Europe and Uzbekistan is a pivotal element of our partnership with the countries of Central Asia. Furthermore, the European textiles industry, which has considerable expertise in processing raw materials, can only benefit from free trade with the world’s third biggest cotton exporter and fifth-largest producer of cotton. However, especially in the textiles industry, closer cooperation must not fail to take into account respect for human rights and for children. As the EU Presidency acknowledged in June, during the cotton harvest the Uzbekistan government uses between 200 000 and 2 million children as a source of labour, closing the schools and dismissing teachers who refuse to send their pupils to work in the plantations. This fact is a serious cause for concern. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

) With the end of the Cold War Central Asia became increasingly important on the international stage, and its importance is destined to become even greater if, as seems probable, relations between East and West continue to intensify in the next few decades. The success of our strategy therefore has a key role in maintaining stable and fruitful relations with countries in Central Asia. Unfortunately, the conclusions of the report by Ms Kiil-Nielsen appear to suggest that Europe is not moving in the right direction. Progress has certainly been made, but not enough for those who wish to establish a long-lasting partnership: we provide limited economic support to these countries; corruption is rife in their political regimes; and there is insufficient respect for fundamental rights, with systematic cases of torture, repression of political opposition and child labour. Finally, as the report points out, dangerous movements with links to Islamic fundamentalism are spreading in the area. For these reasons I voted against the report. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I am opposed to the conclusion of the agreement with Morocco as it will be beneficial neither for Moroccan fishermen nor for European taxpayers. It will not benefit Moroccan fishermen because it will not create new jobs and it will increase the imbalance that already exists between the local fleet and the fishery potential. It will not benefit European taxpayers because they will spend EUR 13.5 million on subsidising the Moroccan fisheries policy without a guarantee that the money will be used in a worthwhile manner.

 I fully support the conclusions contained in Mr Lisek’s report. The defence sector is undoubtedly one of those most severely affected by the austerity policies implemented as a result of the economic crisis. At this rate, Europe risks being unable to shoulder its international responsibilities and seeing some of its traditional areas of strategic weakness, such as duplication of military capabilities and its inability to carry out operations without US support, intensify. In order to prevent such a scenario from occurring, and to avoid draining funds from other important expenditure headings, the only effective solution, as the report indicates, is to move towards greater cooperation within the Union, with due respect for national prerogatives. This cooperation should cover all areas of defence but, in particular, contract liberalisation, technological research, coordination of planning and sharing of certain capabilities. Greater collaboration would, moreover, enable European countries to strengthen their own strategic autonomy and increase their political influence within the Atlantic Alliance. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

There are many points with which I agree in the report tabled by Mr Siwiec and Mr David: from its emphasis on trade, to the importance it attributes to cultural ties between the younger generations in neighbouring countries and Europe; however, I do not feel I can support it. I do not agree with some of the few conclusions on immigration. The proposal to undertake a rapid liberalisation of the visa regime, for example, seems to be a proposal that will cause hardship both to the indigenous populations and to the migrants, at least until the economic and social systems of Europe and neighbouring countries resemble each other.

 I strongly support this proposal. The torrential rains of last winter caused almost EUR 4 billion worth of damage to the region of Veneto. Even though it is not included in the 2011 budget, Parliament is right to approve funding for this region. Thanks to the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund, the affected citizens will receive almost EUR 17 million as a contribution towards reconstruction. Fiorello Provera,

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, throughout the world, obstacles, including legislative obstacles, are increasing against freedom of worship. The number of attacks and murders grow each year and affect practitioners of all religions, but Christians in particular. Paradoxically, religious freedom is becoming an increasingly uncertain issue rather than one of the most natural and indisputable freedoms. In Europe and in our Parliament, we constantly proclaim our defence of human rights, but our work to guarantee religious freedoms is still rather ineffective. That is why I am in favour of the proposal, which has been put forward on other occasions, to commission a specific, accurate and yearly report by Parliament to monitor the state of religious freedoms around the world. This report would provide the necessary facts to plan appropriate and preventive political action in line with what was expressed by the High Representative to organise policies which are country-specific in terms of the needs of the country itself.

 Iran continues to claim that it wants to develop a nuclear programme for civilian purposes. In fact, however, it has carried out research and set up facilities for military purposes, as verified in recent inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Its nuclear ambitions, which in themselves are worrying, are accompanied by a policy of internal repression and aggression towards other countries in the area, such as Saudi Arabia and particularly Israel. This threat has not only political and military repercussions but also economic and strategic ones, because it may affect oil production and thus have economic and financial consequences that would have a direct impact on us as well. A global threat needs a global response. It is therefore crucial to establish very close cooperation with the United States regarding all measures that may from time to time become necessary, such as imposing further, more incisive sanctions on Tehran. I hope it is not already too late. Fiorello Provera,  
on behalf of the EFD Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will talk about the area I know best, northern Italy. The most important issue for our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) at the moment is access to credit; it is far more important than excessive red tape, the tax burden or international competition, particularly from China. The banks are being forced to recapitalise and get rid of the debts caused by their financial speculation, and so they are not granting any more credit to SMEs, which are too small to have their own capital resources or to provide guarantees. Small businesses are therefore unable to contribute to the country’s economic recovery, even if they are willing to do so. It is therefore essential to expand credit schemes of various kinds in favour of SMEs and to improve information about the availability of the financial instruments at their disposal, the Structural Funds in particular. Without money, there is no research, no equipment renewal and no possibility of investing, and therefore it is impossible to contribute to the country’s wellbeing. Fiorello Provera,  
on behalf of the EFD Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the massacre in Egypt to prevent a demonstration to protest against the burning of a Coptic church by Salafi Muslims shows how far it still is from democracy. Quite apart from the difficulties faced by the Copts when they request authorisation to build a church, according to a law dating back to the Ottoman Empire, there are an increasing number of attacks on Christians by Muslim extremists. The protests, instead of being guaranteed by the military authorities in power in Egypt, are being repressed with bloodshed. Paradoxically, these religious conflicts and these repressions were less frequent at the time of President Mubarak. But there are other worrying signs which are disappointing for the expectations of the so-called Arab Spring. I am referring to the attack on the Israeli embassy and the subsequent withdrawal of the ambassador, the attacks on the gas pipelines in the Sinai, the requests by some political parties to revise the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel and, finally, the huge advances being made by Islamist parties. Since the EU has rightly strengthened its political and financial support for Egypt, would it not be appropriate to apply the Füle-Ashton doctrine of ‘more for more’, and therefore also of ‘less for less’, by directing aid to those political, social and trade union organisations that promote democracy and stability in Egypt?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Eastern partnership is an important political dimension for the European Union, but the obstacles to its future development are currently rather concerning. Dialogue with Belarus remains difficult, while in Ukraine, the Tymoshenko case confirms a relapse on respect for human rights as well as rampant corruption. Parts of Georgia and Azerbaijan are under military occupation and the tension between Azerbaijan and Armenia is increasing, with a risk of ensuing armed conflict. Without losing hope on the future of the Eastern partnership, we must remind these six partner countries of their responsibilities: respect for the fundamental rules of democracy and the resolution of territorial conflicts. Here, I am referring in particular to Nagorno-Karabakh and to Georgia. Europe cannot accept violations of international law guaranteeing territorial integrity as, moreover, this House has already appealed for in its resolution on the South Caucasus, and we cannot repudiate our basic principles on respect for human rights.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in a statement on 5 October Commissioners Füle and Malmström expressed their satisfaction with the outcome of discussions with Tripoli on a cooperation agenda which included the management of migration flows, border management, pan-African policy and international protection for refugees and asylum seekers. This ambitious agenda came to an end for the reasons we know – NATO’s military intervention and the change of regime in Tripoli. I believe that the first objective is to resume cooperation with Libya as soon as possible on these major issues – border management, migration flows, energy supplies and the fight against terrorism. That said, another equally important issue is to support Libya’s new leadership in organising free elections as the first step in a long process that will, I hope, one day make it possible to build a truly democratic and stable country. Building a democracy is much more difficult than winning a war, especially if there is no previous memory of democracy in the country. I wanted to know what practical plans can be put in place in the short term to take action within civil society, especially in culture and education, which are key elements for building a true democracy in people’s hearts and minds.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is convinced that it is both opportune and necessary to create two states which can live together and in peace. The difference of opinion merely lies in understanding how to achieve these goals. The Palestinian Authority’s intention of unilaterally applying to the United Nations for recognition as a state is an initiative which, in my opinion, could harm the peace process and spark off chain reactions in the Middle East. There is clearly an intention to isolate Israel in a diplomatic sense and to present it with a fait accompli
, right at a time when the peace agreements with Egypt are threatened by extremist positions and relations with Turkey are in crisis. The episode of the attack on the Israeli embassy in Cairo is the latest link in this chain. The unilateral initiative by the Palestinians is in conflict with the principle shared by both parties, according to which the only solution to the conflict is bilateral negotiations between the parties. Unilateral recognition could therefore create further instability and make it even more difficult to build a democratic Palestinian state that could live in peace with Israel. I therefore hope that there will be a return to the key principles of the Oslo Accords, based on mutual recognition, peaceful coexistence, security and political rights. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I would like to thank Mrs De Keyser for having wished to develop some points from the report on migration flows arising from instability, which was recently adopted by the European Parliament. In particular, the report insists on the importance of a global, coherent approach based on targeted strategies relating to development, human rights, good governance, social inclusion and promotion of women’s and minority rights in order to promote democracy. I agree with the need to build strong coalitions with other actors on the world stage such as the African Union and the Arab League, in order to promote democratic values more effectively, and for more coordination with the United States.

 Although 156 countries have now signed the Ottawa Convention on the prohibition of the use of mines, some 37 countries have still not signed. Europe should therefore urge those states to sign and ratify the convention. I share the opinion expressed by the rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, which underlines the consequences of the use of mines, both from a humanitarian and from an economic point of view, because in addition to the grief and the mutilation of victims, mines stop vast swathes of land being used for human activities.

 I fully support this report by Mrs Tzavela. The development of broadband can, in fact, be useful for economic recovery, for the support that it guarantees to innovation and the possibility of making transactions faster and simpler. The implementation of high-speed broadband networks in Europe is extremely important for the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. The development of broadband is particularly important for disadvantaged regions, such as mountainous areas, in which new technology can support the creation and facilitate the activities of new small and medium-sized enterprises, leading to the possibility of creating new jobs.

 Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the Nagorno-Karabakh issue is little known and often by means of biased information, but a clear point, which is indisputable and, I would say, fundamental, is the principle of territorial integrity of a sovereign state. The inviolability of borders must be respected: this is the case in Georgia, Moldova, Cyprus and so in Azerbaijan. There have been numerous positions adopted on the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and the following have been pointed out: the 2008 Helsinki declaration, four United Nations Security Council resolutions and even our Parliament has given its views on this issue. The territorial integrity of a sovereign state is guaranteed by international law and questioning this principle means encouraging future military attacks and attempts to change the international status quo, with destabilising consequences for the whole world. Europe has a particular interest in resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh issue because Armenia and Azerbaijan fall within the scope of the Eastern Partnership project which expressly provides for stability and collaboration between partner countries. We should therefore work towards this. Lastly, I would point out that time consolidates Armenia’s position in the occupied territories and this makes an agreement more difficult and the situation in the area riskier.

I share the approach of the rapporteur Mrs Lepage, which intends to give Member States the right to prohibit the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on grounds other than those related to health and the environment, which are assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).

 Without a legally binding global international agreement under which the other industrialised nations undertake to make equivalent commitments and emerging countries undertake to make suitable efforts, there are not sufficient grounds for a unilateral increase in the EU emissions reduction target for 2020. It is too early to recognise the Commission’s evaluation of a possible 25% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels, should the EU objective of increasing energy efficiency be met (20% increase by 2020). Before proceeding along these lines a careful examination is required, along with a thorough investigation of the implications in terms of costs. Within the framework of international climate negotiations, recognition of this result at this stage does not seem appropriate, because in the eyes of the other parties it detracts from the unilateral commitment already made by the European Union (-20% by 2020). It is also too early to recognise the milestones identified on the roadmap, before carrying out the necessary investigations for evaluating the implications for Member States. In view of these considerations, I voted against the report. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Europe is characterised by great territorial diversity and polycentric development. In this context, Europe’s cities represent centres of economic activity, innovation and employment, but they must face up to a number of challenges. I welcome the fact that, under this Urban Agenda, the issue regarding the definition of the concept ‘urban’ is left to the Member States in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. There will thus be more opportunity to adapt interventions according to the demands of each Member State. For this reason I welcomed and voted in favour of this measure. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

I concur with the rapporteur in affirming the great importance of ‘territorial cooperation’, which aims to remove physical, administrative and regulatory obstacles and reduce the ‘border effect’ between regions, promoting their harmonious development. This new approach will also be relevant to mountain regions which could similarly play a leading role in realising the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. However, in order to realise these objectives, territorial cooperation programmes will have to be simplified, and local authorities and the public will need to be more involved by encouraging better communication through a large-scale media and awareness-raising campaign.

 Economic, social and territorial cohesion are fundamental principles in determining all EU policies and activities. I share the rapporteur’s view that the economic crisis will force us to be more innovative and to seek a bigger impact from the available funding. Innovation means creating synergies and an integrated approach between the different sectoral policies in order to achieve the optimal result for growth and development on the ground. I particularly agree with the rapporteur’s assertion that synergies and coordination do not imply one-size-fits-all solutions, but call for close strategic coordination between instruments, policies and actors in order to produce carefully designed interventions and programmes which take into account the territorial specificities and comparative advantages or special features of each region in an integrated place-based approach.

 In a large internal market like Europe’s, there is a need to ensure that consumers’ rights are protected. Mr Schwab’s report has the aim of merging four different directives: those on off-premises sales, on distance sales, on guarantees and on unfair contract terms. It is difficult to reconcile 27 different legal traditions on these subjects. This is probably not the most appropriate point in history to issue regulations of this complexity. It would have been more opportune, in my view, to concentrate on specific aspects and sectors, rather than to try and create a new competency shared between the EU and the Member States. In fact, for certain states, this directive will represent an over-large and over-enthusiastic step forward, while other countries will have to make concessions in the name of European harmonisation. For this reason, although I acknowledge the great effort made by Mr Schwab, I cannot vote in favour of this report. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 This directive is designed to ensure that Member States establish a national regulatory and organisational framework and draw up appropriate national programmes for spent fuel and radioactive waste management, regardless of the perspectives of nuclear power and non-power applications. The Commission’s position is commendable: it makes the Member States responsible for the safe management, including disposal, of the spent fuel and radioactive waste that they generate, through the development of their own programmes. On the other hand, many of the amendments incorporated in the text are questionable. On such a sensitive issue as this, maximum transparency and public information are crucial. However, choices of this kind cannot be restricted to public participation in decision-making alone. In fact, the danger of not laying down precise rules is that we will fail to take the decisions necessary to ensure the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste. For this reason I cannot support this report. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have seen that no country can face the problem of immigration alone. It is essential to have a policy governing large migration movements that supports development cooperation and provides for multilateral and bilateral agreements with the migrants’ countries of origin and of transit. Unfortunately, the new European external action instruments have not been used in the spirit or with the vision of the Treaties, as Italy is now finding. The front-line Member States have in fact had to face the refugee crisis by means of unilateral initiatives, without being able to rely on European solidarity. I therefore call on the Commission to define the cases in which we can talk of a ‘mass influx of displaced persons’ under the terms of Directive 2001/55/EC on temporary protection, thereby setting precise, measurable criteria that can be regarded as permanent. Such clarification is important for promoting an effective common policy on migration and ensuring that the burden is shared. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

The Balkan region is one of the most sensitive areas of the EU’s external borders in terms of illegal migration. This phenomenon is of great significance and has repercussions on the daily lives of many of our citizens, exacerbating the insecurity they face. Before being able to think about the possible admittance of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area, special and detailed plans must be drawn up to contain migratory pressures. In addition, improving controls at external borders must be combined with fighting the corruption of local authorities. I voted against this measure for the reasons stated and to better protect our citizens against illegal immigration. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Through this measure, we are at last able to express our desire to improve the work of rating agencies by enhancing their transparency, integrity, responsibility, independence and reliability. While recognising the role of agencies in supplying information and stimulating market liquidity, it is now quite clear that financial operators have placed too much faith in their judgments and that their actions contributed to causing the financial crisis. There is too much dependence on external credit rating agencies and an oligopoly exists in the sector. I am therefore in favour of establishing an independent European Credit Rating Foundation with responsibility for ratings in the public sector, for companies and for structured finance instruments.

European legislation is too often complex, difficult to understand and difficult to apply. This is why impact assessments can make a significant contribution to improving the quality of EU law making, particularly in terms of reducing the timescales and costs of the legislative process. I support this measure because, by taking the requirements of Member States into greater consideration, it will be possible to evaluate the possible social, environmental, financial and economic consequences of a legal act. Impact assessments should also be completely independent and transparent and be carried out in the early stages of the legislative process. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 The Galileo system will improve the accuracy and the reliability of US Global Positioning System (GPS) information. This new system will be important for ensuring Europe’s autonomy and independence from other global navigation systems and enabling it to claim a share of this booming worldwide high-tech market. As we know, the programme is funded fully by the Union budget with a budget of EUR 3.4 billion until 2014. We know that the indirect benefits of the programme are estimated to be around EUR 60 billion per year, but the Commission has admitted that additional investment will be required in order to reach full operational capacity. As it is not clear how much the Galileo system will cost the taxpayer, I abstained on this measure, not least to reiterate the request to the Commission to clarify the project’s future costs.

 Mr President, the dialogue between the European Union and Russia must be expanded as much as possible in various areas, from the economy to human rights, because there are no alternatives to dialogue. Europe and Russia are, in fact, interdependent, both economically and politically. I am thinking of unresolved international issues such as energy security, the Maghreb, Iran’s nuclear capability, terrorism, the Caucasus, Nagorno-Karabakh, climate change and others. Russia is a strategic partner for Europe, not least because of the synergies that may be built in future. As already happens to some extent, Moscow can supply us with mineral and energy resources as well as collaborate on military security and the fight against terrorism and organised crime Europe can contribute with financial resources, scientific and technological capabilities and our long-standing experience in the field of democracy and human rights. Russia’s future is linked to Europe’s and must be developed with perseverance, without complacency and despite the many difficulties that currently exist. In that respect, the conclusion of the strategic partnership agreement between the European Union and Russia is of great importance for our common future. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Sudan, the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa, is a crossroads between the Arab and African worlds, as well as a mosaic of many heterogeneous ethnic groups. It has seen numerous conflicts since its independence from the United Kingdom in 1956. With the signing of the Naivasha Agreement and the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) (2005), 20 years of conflict between the north and south formally came to an end. In January 2011, as provided for in the CPA, a referendum marked the last leg of the road towards the independence of the south from northern Sudan. In this extremely delicate transition phase, we must keep a balanced approach to both north and south, with particular attention to the needs of the south regarding institution building and governance. The aid given by the EU to South Sudan must be measured in terms of the effective capability of this new state to absorb it. Indeed, we must ensure that future flows of funding to Juba do not end up being used inappropriately or, worse, adding to the already widespread corruption. Europe should also increase its commitment to protect the Christian minorities in the north of the country, who are increasingly the targets of persecution and discrimination. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Azerbaijan actively participates in the European Neighbourhood Policy, is one of the EU’s six Eastern partners, and is among the founders of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly. The core values of these three initiatives are respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law. These initiatives are intended to foster a continuous political dialogue that can deepen ties between member countries and enable Europe to accompany them along the path to reform. We believe that the instrument of the emergency resolution may be inadequate or even counterproductive to the achievement of the desired goal, namely, Azerbaijan steadily progressing towards its objectives of full and modern democracy. The institutions set up under the agreements reached at interparliamentary and intergovernmental level are intended to achieve these ends; these are the right place to demand explanations for possible infringements of rights and effectively encourage good behaviour and democratic reforms.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the attacks on Coptic churches in Egypt and the killing of Christians are signs that religious intolerance is worsening, betraying the spirit of unity shown in Tahrir Square, where Copts and Muslims demonstrated together against the regime. Coexistence and social stability are essential for an orderly transition to democracy, but they are made impossible by this lack of tolerance. The authorities in Cairo must therefore make a greater commitment to protect minorities and to oppose Salafi extremism, which is a negation of the principles of modern democracy to which the Egyptian people aspire. Economic development, with the resumption of foreign investment and, above all, tourism, is unthinkable without tolerance, order and stability. It is therefore in the interests of Egypt and the world that Europe should grant generous aid, but this aid must be conditional upon an effective policy to protect minorities, in line with the ‘more for more’ principle that you, Baroness Ashton, proposed together with Commissioner Füle.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to Bahrain. This little country lies in a strategic position in terms of the balance of the Gulf and energy supply distribution. The presence of a major oil refinery for Saudi crude is well known. I would like to draw your attention to one aspect of this situation which seems particularly worrying to me. Reliable sources have identified Iranian influence on the Shi’ite population of Bahrain. This is in addition to the legitimate aspirations for more substantial reforms in the government of that country. It is difficult to determine how much weight outside influence has had on the recent events in Bahrain, but there is a risk of destabilisation of the region that could extend to eastern regions of Saudi Arabia, home to another large group of Shi’ites. Iran funds Hamas, supports Hezbollah in Lebanon and influences the internal politics of Iraq, where Shi’ite Islam is the predominant component of the government. If the disruption of balance spread to the Gulf, the impact would be obvious and there could be global repercussions. We must be very careful in assessing what happens in the Middle East and distinguish the legitimate aspirations of peoples for greater democracy from external influences which have strategic ambitions in the area.

When we review the European Neighbourhood Policy, it is important to assess the impact of this policy on migration. No Neighbourhood Policy can be fully effective in this area without tackling the causes of instability that trigger migration. This entails regional cooperation, potentially via bilateral agreements, with both the countries of origin and with transit countries. We must cooperate with transit countries and with countries of origin for migration so as to prevent surges. We must help the migrants’ countries of origin to democratise and attain good governance by giving them access to our values and our experience. With regard to the European Neighbourhood Policy, we need an economic agenda which can increase levels of employment and trade agreements that can generate real, market-driven, economic development. Commissioner Füle and High Representative Ashton support, with the ‘more for more’ formula, the concept of conditions for aid which aim to reward the countries most active in terms of democratic reforms and respect for human rights. This approach should be encouraged, as it is consistent with our values, effective for development, and does right by European taxpayers. Fiorello Provera,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this tragically topical own-initiative report was first drawn up more than a year ago to assess the phenomenon of immigration and its structural causes in a pragmatic and balanced manner, regardless of political or ideological prejudices. We wanted to investigate the role of foreign policy and its ability to have an effect on the deep-seated causes of immigration, beyond humanitarian or emergency causes. Wars, ethnic tensions, persistent climate change, human rights violations, a lack of civil and economic liberties, endemic corruption, a lack of institutional representatives of citizens’ needs, such as trade unions, associations, political parties: the set of all these elements represents the field of deployment of European foreign policy and resolving these problems will remove many of the reasons that cause millions of people to emigrate. No development cooperation policy can be fully effective without tackling the causes of instability in migrants’ countries of origin. This involves regional cooperation with both with the country of origin and the country of transit, including through bilateral agreements. The Millennium Development Goals are already very ambitious, but certainly will not be achieved without political stability and without implementing effective mechanisms for preventing conflicts and maintaining peace. The global reach of this policy and its holistic approach require clear ideas and substantial financial resources that are difficult to come by in this moment of crisis. It is therefore advisable to coordinate the actions of the Union with those of other major powers such as the United States to avoid duplication of funding in the same areas or dispersal of financial resources, as has often happened in the past. A global phenomenon must be dealt with by a global policy. We must lead the migrants’ countries of origin to democracy and good governance by making available our values and our experience. Under the European Neighbourhood Policy, we should offer an economic agenda that can increase levels of employment and trade agreements that can generate real economic development consistent with market laws. Commissioner Füle and the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, drew attention, with the slogan ‘more for more’, to the concept of conditionality of aid which aims to reward countries that are most actively setting out on the road to democratic reforms and respect for human rights. This is consistent with our European values, effective for development and – if you will allow me – morally fair to taxpayers. I would like to conclude by stating that a European policy for the management of large migration flows should go hand in hand with acceptance of the concept of ‘burden sharing’, in line with the duty of State solidarity under Article 80 of the Treaty, because no country can face up to an emergency of enormous proportions by itself. Finally, I thank Commissioner Malmström for her support for some or many points in this report, and I hope that Europe can actually work with Italy to address a phenomenon that has an international dimension and that affects every one of us. Fiorello Provera,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, before I come to the report, I would like to respond to Mr Meyer and Mr Tavares. I really respect the opinions of everyone, but it seems to me that their views on Lampedusa and what is happening in Lampedusa are hardly generous. I wanted to inform them that 12 000 people arrived in Lampedusa within the space of three nights. Lampedusa is a small island with 6 000 inhabitants and 12 000 people arrived suddenly in three nights, increasing the population to 20 000. I think it is very difficult for any country to accept such a large number of people arriving in such a short space of time on a small island which has no facilities for such a great number of arrivals. There are currently 1 400 migrants on Lampedusa. Much has been done, and as soon as sea conditions permitted, the migrants were transferred to other centres, primarily in the south of the country. This brings us to the report. I wanted to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the different political parties who, with their different sensibilities, have contributed very effectively to this report. They made a fundamental contribution, in absolute transparency, in the same spirit that inspired us all at the beginning. I also thank Commissioner Malmström for the enthusiasm she has shown for the concept of burden sharing, which should influence her work within the Commission and thus within Council. If she continues to show the same enthusiasm, I think the results will follow. I end by saying that the situation is very difficult to sum up. Insofar as a summing up is possible, I would like to say that any policy will be ineffective and incomplete as long as huge differences persist between the levels of development in the North and South of the world, as long as huge differences persist in the quality of democratic institutions, and as long as there are vast differences in respect for human rights. We must take action as part of a major policy of strategic cooperation and aid that will have an impact on the structural causes that led to these huge inequalities between North and South. If we solve those structural causes, the rest will follow and the world we all live in will probably be a better place. Fiorello Provera,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I also wish to express my sympathy and admiration for the dignity, fortitude and cohesion demonstrated by the Japanese people in the face of the sort of catastrophe that the world has rarely seen in terms of size and severity. The behaviour of the Japanese people is truly an inspiration to all and they deserve our help. The lesson to be learned from this experience is the need to strengthen the European civil protection system through more closely coordinated action and the wider availability of people and resources so that we can act quickly in the event of disaster. With regard to the nuclear option, it would be a mistake to discuss this topic on the emotional tide of current events: the subject is too important and must be addressed with a scientific approach. It is absolutely right to strengthen security measures for present and next-generation power stations and to dismantle those that are older and more unsafe, but we must avoid political exploitation and be cautious and pragmatic, as Mr Brok said. We should remember that in the same Fukushima area, a dam collapsed during the earthquake with many casualties, but this does not lead us to think of dismantling dams or building new ones, hence I call for caution, attention and openness to the future.

 Through this report, Parliament has highlighted important issues that deserve to be emphasised in terms of the growth of European industry. I am referring to the recognition of the strategic role of small and medium-sized enterprises and to the need to make it easier to access credit with simplified funding procedures, as well as the importance of internationalisation as a key factor for competitiveness.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Belder on his excellent work. Whilst the world is watching the revolt in the Arab world, Iran continues to repress dissidents. The arrest of the two leaders of the opposition, Mr Mousavi and Mr Karoubi, is the most obvious proof of this. The West took action against Mr Gaddafi, but it continues to dither over Iran, perhaps because Mr Gaddafi has already fallen whilst Mr Ahmadinejad so far has not. The largest rebellion since the post-electoral revolts of 2009 is currently under way in Iran. What are we waiting for before we freeze all the assets held by Mr Ahmadinejad, the companies controlled by the revolutionary guard and all supporters of the regime who are involved in this repression? What are we waiting for in order to impose travel restrictions on these figures of the regime? Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is the principal financial backer of the Palestinian Authority, providing it with around EUR 1 billion per year, and yet Europe’s political role in the peace process remains marginal. This large-scale financial assistance gives us the right to ask the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to return to the negotiating table. On the issue of the recognition of Palestine, we must be clear. The problem of peaceful coexistence with Israel will not be resolved through unilateral recognition of the Palestinian State, which, moreover, still has not been self-proclaimed. The PNA must instead go back to taking an active role, sit down at the negotiating table and resolve the ongoing disputes, particularly over safe borders, on the status of Jerusalem and on the issue of refugees. Even a partial agreement would strengthen the moderate sections of both sides and reduce the influence of extremism. Fiorello Provera,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fall of President Mubarak has paved the way for democracy, but it is also a tremendous opportunity to liberate the Egyptian people. The reform of the country’s democratic institutions will allow for, amongst other things, further development of the economy and the possibility of spreading prosperity to all members of society, even the weakest. Without democracy, economic development will serve only to enrich a few families, as has always been the way in countries that have no social justice. European policy must therefore support Egypt as it embarks on reforms and help the Egyptian people to choose their own future unaided. On the other hand, we must be clear with the future government of Cairo and emphasise that a new and more generous partnership policy will be conditional upon regional security and peace with Israel.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to provide an immediate political response to these emergencies. The urgent interventions requested by Italy are: 1) the transformation of Frontex from a coordination agency to an operative structure with its own people and resources; 2) the implementation of the principle of burden sharing; 3) the use of Europol for investigations on possible terrorist infiltrations and criminal organisation of the traffic in human beings; and 4) the allocation of resources to deal with the emergency. In any case, none of this will resolve the structural causes of the revolutions in the Maghreb, which all arise from the lack of genuine political parties, trade unions, associations, a free press and, above all, lack of respect for human rights. In essence, the institutional tools that characterise true democracy and give the people a voice are missing. Without them, there cannot be economic development, jobs, stability and security for all. This is the real political challenge that Europe must face up to. Fiorello Provera,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the old order is changing in the Maghreb and this crisis raises a multitude of problems that will not be easy to solve. There are risks as well as hopes. It is possible that secular authoritarian regimes could be replaced by aggressive, destabilising Islamic fundamentalist theocracies. We should remember what happened in Iran: it is hard for democratic development to go hand-in-hand with revolution. There are certainly lessons to be learnt from Iran. Another danger is that the economic crisis in the area is likely to worsen, resulting in even greater youth unemployment and large influxes of migrants that Europe can no longer cope with. These events are a sign that our Euro-Mediterranean policy is inadequate and show that the cooperation policy implemented so far is not up to the task of creating the conditions for development and democracy. What has happened is not due solely to the economic crisis, even though it has been severe, but to the lack of social stability, in other words the lack of vehicles to represent the people’s interests, such as trade unions, a free press, political pluralism, a voluntary sector, the rule of law and equal opportunities for everyone. Supporting the countries of this region in their journey should be at the heart of Europe’s policy, alongside economic and trade assistance. This is the way to create true stability: not the stability provided by authoritarian regimes, but stability founded on social consensus, participation and democratic institutions.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Cesare Battisti is not a romantic hero as some have depicted him, but a savage murderer with a history of robbery who has been found guilty of killing four people with shots to the back of the neck. He benefited unjustly from Mr Mitterrand’s doctrine of political asylum and has been protected and idealised by some left-wing French intellectuals. Having fled to Brazil to avoid repatriation and prison, Mr Battisti was saved by President Lula due to an erroneous decision that was probably made for political reasons, with no regard for the suffering of the victims and their relatives. Mrs Figueiredo, Parliament’s request to the Brazilian authorities and to the Commission does not only ask for the respect of legal rules and bilateral agreements, but also aims to affirm the principle that no ideological reason can justify the actions of a murderer and no country may guarantee him impunity. We must never forget that there is ethical value in the moral compensation of victims by serving a punishment. This is at the foundation of the social contract that props up all communities that are civilised, or that aim to be. Giancarlo Scottà,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must thank Ms García Pérez for her long and patient work over the last year to reach an agreement that is as close as possible to Parliament’s position. The course of events started back in 2009 with our own-initiative report on quality products, which highlighted certain important issues on which we have achieved results today and others on which we still have work to do. The outcome we have secured is a success for all those producers, associations and cooperatives that have supported us over these years, and acknowledges their commitment to quality. The importance of their work is highlighted in this report, since the Member States are enabled to promote the establishment and operation of such groups. The positive outcomes obtained are due to the teamwork shown by Parliament’s delegation to the meetings with the other institutions. They include ex officio
 protection, whereby the Member States must protect products with quality marks, even where they are used as ingredients in processed products, without waiting for producers to make a complaint. In contrast to the measures introduced in Mr Nicholson’s report on contractual relations in the milk and milk products sector, production management for quality marks in other sectors has been left out of the report now being debated. It was simply not possible to reach agreement on production planning, a crucial issue for our producers. They wanted this instrument above all to make it possible to balance demand and supply. We will continue working alongside our fellow Members to achieve this outcome as well. Lastly I would like to thank the Italian associations that represent the cooperatives, which have worked with us and will continue to do so. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a substitute member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and a full member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I have had the occasion to work on this dossier. I have the impression that, on this issue, the Commission is not taking the real protagonists of the event – the breeders and the producers – into consideration. The aim of the proposals is to introduce a ban on voluntary labelling – a measure that is precisely not obligatory – which allows producers who choose to do so to provide additional information on the label. Since the same organisations representing breeders and producers have asked for this measure to continue to be provided, it is paradoxical not to concede this possibility. On the contrary, within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, work is being carried out in order that our farmers can provide data relating to the products that they sell in as transparent a way as possible. It therefore seems counterproductive to work, on the one hand, to protect the provision of information to consumers and make it transparent while, on the other hand, abolishing measures, voluntary measures even, that go in the same direction. It is clear that these are choices to be made if the intention is to lower the quality and the standards of agricultural products. There is no other explanation of a comparable measure against breeders committed to providing indications of quality, such as the choice of one type of feed rather than another. For these reasons, I will be voting against certain amendments. Giancarlo Scottà,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard and as has been said, I am concerned about what is happening in Syria, where the conflict is continuing with increasing loss of human life. Neither of the two sides can win via the military approach and the only possible solution is a political one, supported by the government and the opposition. Europe must work to this end. The dangers to avoid are a takeover by Islamic extremism or the Balkanisation of the country along ethnic and religious lines. I hope that Europe adopts a serious and practical stance – which, as we have already heard, it is working on – and I therefore hope for an excellent outcome to put an end to these civilian and military deaths, and everything else.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we have adopted today proposes the creation of a single working and services area for the maritime, mountain and lake areas of the Mediterranean basin, with the participation of national governments and, above all, local and regional authorities. This project rekindles the political ideal of a Europe of the regions, in line with the founding fathers’ original vision for Europe. To highlight the importance of macro-regions, I would like to highlight and bring to your attention an initiative that came about, in part, as a result of the work and ideas of my party’s representatives. It is the agreement to create the macro-region of the Alps, signed in St Gallen, Switzerland, on 29 June by regions belonging to France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria and Germany. The leaders of the three northern Italian regions of Veneto, Lombardy and Piedmont took part in the meeting. I hope this initiative will soon come to fruition, not least in this Chamber, thereby helping Europe evolve towards a genuine Europe of the people and of the regions. That is the only way to overcome the current financial crisis, to add value to our regions and their special quality products, to revive the economy in real terms, and to fully implement the principle of subsidiarity. That is why I voted for Mr Alfonsi’s report. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with my colleague’s report on rural development where it introduces some appreciable elements of simplification such as the reduction in the number of annual progress and summary reports. Under the heading of rural development is the change to the rules on using advisory services, which should help to reduce the administrative burden for Member States. I also agree with Mr De Castro on the need not to exclude support for producer associations in the fruit and vegetable sector, as part of measures to support the establishment and administration of producer associations. I also consider it essential, as the rapporteur stated, that Member States which have opted for regional programmes be allowed calculation of the automatic decommitment of financial resources at Member State level. I also agree with the position of Mr Capoulas Santos in his report on the system of financing by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, and I thank the other Members that I have not mentioned for their work.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Ms Paulsen for her report. I find it very odd that in such a prestigious House, where important decisions will be taken, there are still those who, in an ambiguous, anachronistic spirit of animal welfare, waste precious time and cost all European citizens and taxpayers money, with no benefit to human welfare or health. Faced with a text that is potentially of great interest to animal lovers – I am one too – and that will naturally have positive consequences for animals themselves, people are seeking to table amendments that undermine all the premises of the text and the very meaning of our friends’ welfare, with abstract suggestions of no legal or ethical value. Therefore, I cannot help wondering whether we should be investing – maybe I should say ‘wasting’ – time and resources to deal with proposals devoid of any practical interest for Europeans. Consequently, I shall be voting for Ms Paulsen’s report. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the objectives of the programme for food distribution include reasonable prices, market stabilisation and support for deprived persons. The institutions and national authorities have confirmed the need for full support of the programme through the EU budget, rejecting proposals for cofinancing by the Member States. There has been discussion about food wastage. We recently approved the report by Mr Caronna, which included the problem of the meagre access of the poorest population groups to food. I think that the issues are closely linked: helping to reduce wastage also means helping the most deprived. There are many local initiatives to help people in financial difficulties. I would like to mention the example of food collections, which should play a more prominent part in the programme on which we have been asked to vote. People who wish to donate spontaneously but do not have channels to do so need to be organised and put online. I would like to take the opportunity to thank all those who work towards these goals in their everyday lives. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate my fellow Member on choosing the issues tackled. Why new skills? Changes in the labour market undoubtedly make it necessary to change and acquire new skills. However, what should we do with the skills that represent our heritage and our traditions? Ms Bastos highlights the need to maintain the craft tradition and its associated skills. However, we need to do more. What about the trades that were once pivotal to the economy in certain areas? These areas, for example, in the mountains and foothills, no longer exist, having been abandoned in favour of the cities. One solution which could help create jobs and therefore help with employment might be precisely to rehabilitate certain trades and traditions, which would also help disadvantaged areas. In order to ensure certain jobs continue, we need to invest in the young and give them a leading role in projects, traditions and trades that have fallen into disuse in the areas in question. Training aimed at finding young people jobs in small companies in these areas would have a two-fold benefit, helping to rehabilitate abandoned areas and increasing youth employment.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the key word in this report is ‘consumer’. We often forget who we are addressing when we take decisions. Important decisions have been taken in the report we are discussing, such as the indication of specific nutritional value or the indication of origin, in order to give consumers more correct information. It is a step forward, not the ultimate goal. Indication of origin for agricultural food products –
 the provenance of the main foodstuffs that make up a product –
 should be the first information available to the consumer. There are various cases in which traceability is vital, the latest being the bacteria which unfortunately killed several people. By identifying the provenance of a product it is possible to take swift action or to safeguard the product from incorrect information. The issue of competitiveness is no less important. Often an indication of origin can be a guarantee and a promise of quality. The various quality products of each country have won the trust of consumers. We support the indication of origin because consumers have the right to know what they are eating. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, of all Europe’s policies, the common agricultural policy is the one that has had to be updated the most over the years in order to cope with constant changes occurring on the economic front, including at international level. It has always been updated with two main goals in mind: guaranteeing an income for European farmers and dealing with an ever-decreasing EU budget, while not forgetting a whole host of other objectives linked to quality of production, of the environment, of biodiversity and of water resources. The CAP reform on which we will vote tomorrow is vital if we are to continue to support the income of our farmers, as my colleagues have already mentioned. The aim, then, is not to reduce direct subsidies but to find a balance between such subsidies and rural development, so that the system is rendered simpler and fairer, without the rules of competition being called into question. As regards the objectives of the CAP in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy, the CAP can contribute to the growth of a sustainable economy by responding well to new challenges and taking account of the diversity and richness of agriculture and the specific characteristics of the 27 Member States.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer my contribution by stating the need for a new methodological approach, particularly in the heritage and cultural heritage sector, linked to the intelligent use of new technology. An awareness of the massive potential for improvement that new technologies can offer us, both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, necessarily involves abandoning the ways we worked in the past. New technologies mean new working methods. I myself have witnessed that by using technology intelligently in the monument protection sector, it is possible to obtain significant results, in terms of both the planning and restoration works. Additionally, as a simultaneous by-product, and without incurring additional costs, we can obtain highly accurate geometrical databases that can be used to monitor and manage the artefact in the event of natural disasters, as well as products for scientific education and for promoting the artefact on a global scale, fulfilling criteria for cultural understanding and exchange What I think matters most is that we contribute to a plan of action, whose aim is to help us reach a new awareness of technology, so that new economic opportunities may be created for Europe. I believe especially in the need to train new people and in professional, young and highly qualified individuals, who are able to rise to the challenges posed by the new global market.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, novel foods are food products or ingredients that undergo production processes and involve a change in nutritional value. I have a number of doubts about the new Novel Food Regulation. What relation will it bear to the regulation on genetically modified organisms (GMOs), since cloning is an aspect of genetic engineering and, as with GMOs, it involves actual genetic manipulation? How will the movement of these foods between European countries be regulated? How will the scientific tests needed to test the safety of these novel foods be carried out? What will the criteria be for defining these products and, most of all, how will consumers be informed of the characteristics and nutritional properties of the novel foods they purchase? My central concerns are consumer protection, food safety in the use of these novel products, and correct information. I therefore believe there must be total traceability for consumers, especially for natural products, for which we already find it difficult to guarantee traceability. Giancarlo Scottà,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased with this initiative, which aims to transform the European Heritage Label into a formal action of the European Union in order to increase its effectiveness, visibility, prestige and credibility. To this end, I should like to emphasise the importance of the professionalism of the members of the panel of experts appointed to evaluate the sites, as well as the rigorousness of the procedures for attribution of the label and reviewing its maintenance as time goes on. These elements are essential to ensure the specificity and quality of the label itself. The label must, however, focus entirely on symbolic and educational value, rather than on the beauty of the site – as other initiatives for the promotion of cultural heritage tend to – so as to clearly differentiate it from these. Therefore, I also agree that transnational sites should be held in particular consideration, in virtue of their symbolic importance. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome Mrs Mănescu’s report. Multi-level governance has a key role to play in cohesion policy and, in this respect, the multi-level approach, which provides for cooperation and shared responsibilities across various levels of government, is being put into practice in the management of regional funds. The Commission is promoting initiatives in favour of regional and local authorities. There must be a greater incentive to support such proposals in order to ensure the real coordination and effective implementation of European programmes. The partnership must be guaranteed by a culture based on dialogue between the various parties involved. Cooperation at regional level must be transparent and must ensure fair representation of all concerned. For this reason, it is important to provide appropriate training for subnational representatives through initiatives such as Erasmus for regional and local officials, the financial cost of which must be borne by the Commission. This is likewise useful for exchanging good practices and for improving the quality and effectiveness of cohesion fund management. Giancarlo Scottà,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the third summit between the European Union and Africa is a fundamental opportunity to consolidate relations between the two parties. During this event we will talk about economic growth, sustainable development and political governance, considering several dossiers, including an examination of the agriculture and food safety sector in the context of the Millennium Development Goals. In order to guarantee universal access to food, combat poverty in rural areas and improve the quality of agricultural production, the participation of producers’ organisations and sector associations is required so that they can be committed and aware, and improve the distribution and management of natural resources. The European Union must work to make the best of these opportunities to intensify dialogue and cooperation in support of regional integration in Africa. In particular, the imbalances and corruption of cooperation initiatives must be fought. Governments’ responsibilities must not predominate over those of civil society and the participation of all those involved in strategies of sustainable economic and social growth must be guaranteed.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, cereal price volatility is having severe repercussions on all livestock sectors but also on consumers. Cereal exporting is blocked due to the effect of the heat, fires, drought and floods – as is happening now in Italy. To aggravate the situation, Canada has reduced production following heavy rainfall this summer. Prices have been influenced not only by climate change but also by speculation on international markets. Cereal producers who are awaiting a price increase wait before selling their produce and put it in store, with the result that these agricultural products deteriorate. Speculation and severe climate change have led to a great increase in the prices of cereals used as animal feed and a knock-on increase in meat prices. I believe it is essential for the Commission to ensure timely, targeted action to deal with the volatility in agricultural-product prices through innovative market interventions under the new CAP. The Commission must prevent speculative practices in agriculture to preserve the businesses of farmers and stock breeders and guarantee consumers genuine quality products at fair prices.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to a sector in which conditions for the female workforce continue to be precarious. I refer to the agricultural sector, a sector in which women focus on innovation and, at the same time, on revitalising traditions and preserving agricultural heritage, keeping rural territory alive. Yet female workers encounter a range of obstacles in their working activities, having to reconcile their working life with family life. Mrs Thomsen, in her report, provides a figure which gives us food for thought: in the agricultural sector, 86% of female workers are employed part-time. Furthermore, the entry of young women into this sector is fraught with difficulty and for this reason, women managing the farms are often over 65. On the other hand, some other women assume the position of supporting partner, or rather, they help with their husband’s farm, without being entitled to a legal status and without being appropriately remunerated. I would argue, therefore, that it is necessary to protect women and their employment in a sector in which their work is often temporary and seasonal, support them in the area of health and safety, and ensure they receive fair pay and appropriate recognition for their work.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, future regional and cohesion policy must be aligned with the Europe 2020 strategy priorities, and therefore it must be focused on the objectives of sustainable growth, social inclusion and employment. It needs to support the effective development of the European regions by levelling out the differences between them and enhancing the specific characteristics of the more marginalised areas which are still facing regional development challenges. The projects must take into account the less developed regions, which have been most severely affected by the crisis. New challenges such as population density in certain areas and depopulation in others, in mountain areas, in particular, along with climate change, must be addressed through concrete actions that strengthen local and regional involvement. The multi-level approach must stimulate the integrated development of disadvantaged areas by involving local and regional authorities as well as civil society. I urge the Commission to take into account the specific characteristics of each region, namely the regional dimensions of the various levels of development, and to simplify the management and control procedures for financed projects in order to ensure their effective and prompt execution.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon devotes particular attention to regions with severe and permanent handicaps. This is why I support Mr Provera’s initiative concerning the agricultural, environmental and cultural rehabilitation of these regions. I therefore call for the Commission to set to work as soon as possible on implementing a policy for mountain regions that will tackle the difficulties, declining population and abandonment of mountain regions, with the environmental degradation that that entails. It is crucial to provide for the agricultural activity, quality of life and cultural heritage of those living in disadvantaged conditions, and it is fundamental to ensure that the actions undertaken by the Commission, the Member States and regional and local authorities are in harmony with one another. A fundamental principle of the European Union is subsidiarity, an instrument that is crucial to promoting the development of disadvantaged regions through lasting and well-targeted measures resulting from regional proposals. This is a significant challenge, and the task will be to keep people in these regions, or, better still, to encourage them back there. Giancarlo Scottà,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is both important and necessary to achieve a balance between the need to advance scientific research and the need to protect animal welfare. Protection for animals used in scientific procedures is currently inadequate. New scientific knowledge means that alternatives can be promoted to replace or reduce the use of animals. Methods or procedures must be used that cause as little pain and suffering as possible, but without impeding scientific research designed to fight diseases. It is therefore right to review Europe’s animal protection legislation in order to achieve satisfactory results that both meet the demands of the research industry, given the need to pursue scientific research that benefits human health, and, at the same time, look after the welfare of those animals still needed for scientific purposes.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lyon, ladies and gentlemen, in a context such as this, farms need strong support in order to innovate and make progress. The role of farmers needs to undergo a radical change: by systemising agricultural production farmers become agricultural entrepreneurs, and thus promote economic development. I believe it is fundamentally important for the recovery of countless abandoned areas of land to be used in the creation of short, closed agricultural branches – in other words, systems that link agricultural cultivation directly to sales. These systems can operate and become widespread throughout the European Union. I believe that, under the new common agricultural policy (CAP), the Commission should support the creation of agricultural cooperatives so as to cut production costs and make farmers more competitive. The Commission must commit itself to defining a budget that is sufficient to achieve these objectives. The funding for the new CAP must be linked to results, so as to prevent waste and various kinds of speculation. What is more, at this time of crisis, many young people want to return to farming. However, they are faced with various obstacles: land is too expensive, and rural development policies are difficult to manage; the fact that there are long waiting times for land and that it is granted on the basis of earnings rather than on the basis of the ideas expressed by young entrepreneurs prevents this group from realising its potential. I believe that the Commission must take a supportive and flexible approach to helping young farmers. An information policy must also be launched, starting in schools and universities, in order to promote a … (The President cut off the speaker) Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Spanish Presidency has decided to sign this agreement. This decision has caused some concern, as we have already heard, and in tabling this question my fellow Members are asking for clarification as regards the impact that the negotiations may have on European producers and products. I wished to point out that the creation of a free-trade relationship between the two parties allows for imports into Europe of animal products containing antibiotic growth activators that have not undergone sufficient testing, and of genetically modified agricultural products that could jeopardise farmers’ food safety. I therefore call on the Commission to adopt an authoritative position so as to safeguard European quality production. The Commission must also undertake to ensure that Europe’s high production standards are recognised at international level and that these same standards are required of all imported products. Lastly, I believe that the Commission should take account of the concerns expressed by the various associations in the sector, so as to ensure transparent and fair negotiations that do not harm the European economy.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are being asked to vote on a draft report on information to consumers, but have we really asked ourselves what consumers want? Have these considerations been agreed on behind closed doors in Parliament, or do they reflect the interests of consumers? The latest survey announced by the Commission may not be representative of the increased awareness that consumers have developed in recent years with regard to information about their food choices. It is not only the origin but also the ingredients and other characteristics that are becoming a fundamental part of the decision-making process. Are we aware that the decisions we make today will influence tomorrow’s purchases? Should it not be consumers who determine the market? Why not try to understand, through a new survey or by maintaining ongoing direct dialogue with consumers, what it is that they really want? We must represent consumers as best we can. That is why we are here and, from the meetings I have had, I have discovered that consumers want to be involved more. They do not expect the buying process to be complicated by the inclusion of pointless information on labels, but nor do they expect overly simplistic, misleading choices such as the traffic light system, which risk providing irrelevant information that is not necessary for an informed choice and does not meet their needs. Our approach must not be paternalistic but open to dialogue. Giancarlo Scottà,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with market globalisation and the severe crisis now affecting Europe, including in the agricultural sector, one possible response on the part of the agricultural market is to place emphasis on product quality. I believe that a good EU quality policy can enhance competitiveness and create added value for Europe’s regional economies, since, for many rural areas where production alternatives are few, it is often the one and only opportunity for development. By supporting niche agriculture in these disadvantaged areas, we will create an economy and jobs there. Furthermore, a future quality policy must also be linked to the major potentialities of agriculture which, as in the European case, is modern, dynamic, rich and diversified and can offer not only high quality food products but also services of great value to a constantly evolving society. In my report, I emphasised the importance of keeping the three systems for registration of geographical indications separate, since they represent the link with European regions, representing their traditions, history, taste and unique knowledge handed down over time. I therefore believe that, by keeping the two PDO and PGI systems separate, they take account of the specific differences in the nature and strength of the links between the products and their geographical area of production. Consumers often confuse the geographical indication of where a food product was processed with the place of origin of the agricultural product as such, and are often not aware of how the food chain operates. I therefore consider that only the compulsory indication of the place of production of the primary products can provide consumers with full information on the quality of the products they are buying, since products are subject to a production cycle which exerts considerable influence on their characteristics in terms of quality and food safety. Let us remember that it is our duty to protect what our fellow citizens, who voted for us, produce and eat. Another two issues that I considered important to include in my report are as follows: the importance of an intensive campaign of consumer education and information, which the European Union should undertake concerning the various European labels and the guarantees they represent, and the inclusion in international registries and international recognition through the WTO system of geographical indications. This last point is vitally important if we want to protect against the counterfeiting of our high quality products. I would like to thank Commissioner Cioloş for his attendance and remind him of the importance of sufficiently protecting quality systems, which are our future, and remind him too that the economy of disadvantaged rural areas can be boosted by agricultural sector aid, to safeguard all those niche products that are typical of these areas and that keep the people connected to the locality, which would otherwise be abandoned. This would support respect for the environment and for the landscape and would create, where possible, a tourist and oenogastronomy economy linked to the various regional, cultural and historical differences in the European Union. I would like to thank my colleagues for the support they gave me in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and I hope that the European Parliament will also give its support during the vote tomorrow.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, Commissioner Cioloş. I should like to begin by talking very briefly about the land. The land is that from which we harvest our products and which we must preserve for the future and for those who will have to do the same. That is why, taking this simple thought as a starting point, I should like to move on to producers, to those who work the land, who must be recognised also by those who subsequently enjoy the commercial produce they find in the supermarket or some other shop. It is therefore only right that we respect first the land, which yields the produce, then the processor, if any, but above all the consumer. I should like to make a proposal for the benefit of consumers, and I am not sure whether it will be welcomed or not: why not ask consumers what they want to know? In this way, we will know which potential label consumers are able to read and to understand, and thus perhaps make it much simpler than the complicated labels we have today. Why must consumers not know that they have the choice of drinking a litre of milk from Europe or a litre of milk from Brazil? It will be for them to choose whether a litre of Brazilian milk is better than a litre of milk produced in the European Union. Be that as it may, I consider and I hope that this report will be useful for Commissioner Cioloş by providing further details to help grow that thread I referred to earlier: the land, the producer, the processor, if any, the consumer, safety and, above all on the issue of safety, quality. We have all spoken about quality, and I believe that we are all in favour of raising the quality of our produce even more if it means eating well and eating healthily. Giancarlo Scotta',

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to stress my doubts about the proposal to extend the 2009-2010 intervention period for butter and skimmed milk powder, since this proposal is in danger of turning short-term measures designed for the current crisis in the market into structural measures that would actually restore the dairy farming sector to the position it was in before quotas were introduced. In an effort to make the market measures more balanced, where benefits are not given solely to those Member States involved in butter and skimmed milk powder production, I call for the reintroduction of Community aid for private storage of cheese with a long maturation period. Lastly, I would like to draw your attention to the matter of the origin marking and labelling of dairy products and to the traceability of products: this is a request that comes directly from European consumers – in ever greater numbers – and one that might help us to tackle the crisis in the dairy farming sector. I hope that my fellow Members from the other groups, too, can endorse this proposal. Oreste Rossi  (EFD

 The European Commission must decide once and for all whether it wants to have a Solidarity Fund that responds to serious natural disasters and shows solidarity with those affected rapidly and promptly or whether it wants to indulge in some form of worthless public image exercise. We are dealing here with measures for European civil protection that require prompt provision of assistance to those in difficulty and the European Commission is not capable of releasing the financial assistance to help the earthquake victims of Emilia-Romagna. The proposal to obtain funds through redeployment, from sources that currently amount to EUR 13 million is ridiculous and the Commission should be ashamed of it. I also wish to underline that the European Commission is currently deciding whether to demand that enterprises return the assistance they received for flooding in 1994 and paid out to them by the Italian government, without realising that this would mean certain bankruptcy. I think that the Commission should seriously rethink its position, because it seems to have no knowledge whatsoever of the problems that are being discussed here today, or what it means to be affected by natural disasters.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution is based on a perfectly acceptable principle, which I myself have expressed more than once, underlining both the threat posed by climate change and the fact that it needs to be dealt with at an international level, but by all parties. It is wrong, however, to ask the European Union to take steps unilaterally to cut emissions by 50 % over the levels of the 1990s by 2050. It should be evident that if we continue to depress European industry, we encourage relocation of large enterprises to third countries. Unlike the members of the committee, I consider the Durban Package to be insufficient because no binding global agreement was reached on reduction of emissions. It is sheer madness to think of embarking on the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol unilaterally, in the absence of the United States, the Russian Federation, Japan and Canada, with uncertainty regarding Australia and New Zealand, and knowing that the great polluters such as China, India, Brazil and Indonesia continue to lack emissions reduction targets.

 I support the text of the report on the ‘Offshore Protocol’ because I believe there is a need for increased safety of offshore oil and gas exploitation activities, especially following the dramatic accident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Offshore activities in the Mediterranean are likely to increase due to the discovery of new reserves of fossil fuel, and an accident of such kind could have immediate large-scale effects on a semi-closed sea such as the Mediterranean, causing tragic consequences for its economy and its fragile ecosystems, and undermining the efforts made by EU Mediterranean coastal Member States to achieve and maintain good environmental status in their marine waters as required by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. In view of the importance of this Protocol on exploration and exploitation in the Mediterranean, the removal of harmful waste and the removal of disused installations, I hope that it will be complied with and implemented with provisions on safety and monitoring.

 I am in favour of the text under examination, which seeks the implementation of promotion measures and information provision for agricultural products. I believe that, for consumers to eat properly, they should be properly informed, with the product origin shown on the label. That is the only way of guaranteeing food safety. This policy aims to promote local markets, developing the concept of low food miles and at the same time enhancing market potential in the EU. I also support the promotion of information campaigns on quality wines, aimed at responsible consumption and – this should not be underestimated – the need to educate children on the importance of a healthy, balanced diet based on fruit, vegetables, etc. provided that these are of good quality. The quality policy for agricultural products should therefore on the one hand provide farmers with the tools to identify products with special characteristics and promote them more effectively and on the other protect them from unfair practices.

Mr President, personally, I have not been contacted by any lobby groups in favour of shale gas, despite the fact that I sit on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and am convinced that this is a resource we should be exploiting with the requisite care.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what concerns me is that I do not think we are the ones being irresponsible by being in favour of the extraction of something that could make Europe self-sufficient in terms of fossil fuels; it is the Greens criticising this stance who are irresponsible because they are fine about keeping themselves warm – obviously I do not think they stay cold – with the same or similar products imported from third countries where mining and drilling is done at the risk of causing earthquakes. You see, if you take oil or gas out from under the ground you create the same voids that are formed by extracting shale gas. So this is fine for other countries but it should not happen in Europe. We have to spend taxpayers’ money paying for stuff from third countries when we could – this is only a possibility – we could be self-sufficient with stuff we produce in Europe. At this point something does not make sense to me and I start to wonder whether the Greens have some other hidden agenda. I will close by saying that I really think caring for the environment is important, but I do not think we should miss this opportunity to extract something that could make Europe economically self-sufficient from the point of view of oil and gas extraction.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Ms Sartori because, with this initiative, we are finally able to discuss a problem that has affected hundreds of thousands of workers who, due to rash decisions that force the European Union to tackle climate change unilaterally and excessively, face losing their jobs. Steelworks, as major energy consumers, are even more crippled by the European Commission’s decision to withdraw some of the ETS quotas already distributed and its determination to set a minimum price for future auctions. This decision by the European Commission, which I criticised during a debate within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, will mainly affect the steelworks themselves, which already lost 10 % of their market share in 2011 and in 2012 stand to lose a further 12 %. The only solution to avoid unfair competition from third countries is to impose import tariffs, in proportion to the difference in the cost of steel production in Europe and in the third country.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am in favour of the text of Ms Costa’s report on protecting children in the digital world, given that the percentage of young people online is constantly growing. I think that it is imperative to protect minors from websites with harmful content with strong elements of violence, racism and discrimination. Moreover, we must not underestimate the presence of child pornography websites, which can put at risk the lives of the very youngest, and of people who try to lure minors. It is for schools to train minors in the practical and critical use of the digital technology associated with the internet. Training allows young people to master digital skills, which have been recognised as among the eight key competences required for those living in a knowledge-based society. With schools, society shares this responsibility, aware as it is of the social and economic advantages of critical, active and safe use of digital media by minors, as opposed to use leading to dependence … (The President cut off the speaker) Oreste Rossi  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this presentation proposes objectives that we all support, such as combating unemployment, reintegrating the unemployed, relaunching small and medium-sized enterprises, guaranteeing the security of pension schemes – but it does not propose any measures for meeting these challenges. For example, it does not go into any depth in considering which resources the Member States should use to deal with the crisis, nor does it criticise the scandalous choice made by the European Commission in financing the banks without using the funds awarded to bring about economic upturn, thus allowing the credit institutions not to help businesses and families but to acquire government securities, ensuring a guaranteed profit for themselves at almost no risk. Accordingly, the decision was taken, in a period of crisis like this, to finance the banks rather than to encourage an improvement in the economic structure. It would have been an excellent proposal to call on the Commission to propose removing the prohibition on direct aid to the States by the European Central Bank. I shall abstain, since the report amounts to a simple declaration of intent, on points that we all support, but which is devoid of content or concrete proposals.Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rosy picture painted by President Barroso contrasts with a reality that is plain to see: millions of workers protesting for job and wage security so as to be able to support their families and hundreds of thousands of small enterprises in difficulty. In Italy there has been a wave of suicides by small business owners, suffering side-by-side with their employees, because your friend Mr Monti only wants to help the banks and could not care less if the whole system of small and medium-sized enterprises, which has been so much a part of our country socially and industrially, disappears. I would also like underline one case that could be seen as emblematic of a Europe that is standing by and watching the death of its industrial, productive and above all manufacturing capacity. Anomalies in European funding have been discussed, but there is one instance of funding that stands out from all the rest. You have awarded the brother of Totò Riina EU funding. The brother, in other words, of the boss of bosses of the Italian mafia. And you granted funding to another boss while he was still in prison. Well that is a disgrace! It is a disgrace that this European super-bureaucracy did not even notice that it was financing somebody with the surname ‘Riina’. Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's discussion, which doubtless reprises other previous discussions, gives us a fairly limited picture of the problem, in my humble opinion. We cannot tackle the social problem and the social aspects and implications of this large-scale restructuring, which do not just affect the companies mentioned by the Commissioner. In Italy, for example, Fiat’s chief executive is misleading the public, and more importantly Fiat’s employees, by saying, ‘Don’t worry, our new products will be sold on the US market’, when everyone knows very well that the US market has no need for more imports; it is quite capable of meeting its future production requirements, even though it seems to have its own problems which are very different from Europe’s. In Europe there is no industrial policy for the automotive sector: we have a European Union which is dilly-dallying and has failed to come up with a sound plan, in view of social and other developments. The market has completely changed, and Europe needs to wake up. It needs to do something, because we need to maintain and conserve the level of quality and the technological and development capacity of manufacturing, especially in a key sector such as the European automotive industry.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Erasmus programme should be defended tooth and claw for the rights and future of our young people. It would be much better to cut the super-high pay and pensions of our senior officials, those untouchables of the European Union, or to reduce the gifts to high finance and the banking system. Some practical suggestions have been made by young people involved in Erasmus. During the Erasmus Day Live initiative, some suggestions were made to President Barroso such as exchanging homes, which could make it easier and less expensive for families, or introducing some working hours (young people want to work, and they could do so in libraries and archives, or in cultural institutions), and regionalisation. Some regions like my own, Piedmont, have suggested intervening along the lines of the principle of subsidiarity. Let us expand the basis for participation in Erasmus, let us give young people the role of offering suggestions and taking action. Erasmus is important. We critics of Europe are more supportive of Erasmus than some pro-Europeans, who want to cut not high-level bureaucracy, not costs or waste – good heavens, no! – but the things that serve the future of young people in Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not find this banking union convincing, because it seems to have no purpose other than to place a fine gravestone over any prospect of adopting the legal principles of the Glass-Steagall Act in Europe. In that respect, how can we not share the concern expressed by Georg Fahrenschon, the president of the German savings banks association, for whom a banking union with centralised supervision in the hands of the European Central Bank (ECB) and a common deposit guarantee fund is like a life assurance policy for ‘systemic’ banks, in other words those banks – not all of them – whose bellies are full of derivative rubbish? We are all well aware of that, but nobody dares say it! This solution will ensure that healthy banks, such as savings banks (not only the German ones but also the ones in Padania) and cooperative banks, which are close to the land, the people and the regions – you may recall the message given out yesterday by 2 million Catalans who want their freedom – will foot the bill so that the sick ones can continue to speculate. I would like to ask a final question: every day, Mario Draghi, the President of the ECB, says that the euro is irreversible. I would like to know if any of you have found an article in the Treaties that allows him to decide which currency the Member States should adopt. I have not found one. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, ladies and gentlemen, if we are about to hold the euro area’s funeral, we must admit that you, just like our Prime Minister, Mr Monti, have exactly the right look and physique for the part. This agreement sounds strange. We wanted to send a reassuring message, but this debate shows that it is built on shaky foundations, perhaps on nothing. For Italy, unless the European Stability Mechanism’s role as a panacea is fully supported by the ECB – something that remains to be seen – Mr Monti’s victory will be exactly like Italy’s football win against Germany: a Pyrrhic victory. Perhaps we can be saved from this danger of a future debacle by Our Lady of Fátima, but certainly not by your indecision, uncertainty or by pulling the wool over our eyes. Is what came out of the corridors of your summit true or not? Namely, the fear of Heads of State or Government that there will be a massive collapse in the banking sector which holds billions of derivatives thanks to your inattention, to tax havens, to everything that you allowed to happen. Why then, are you not straight with us about the heart of this problem: not state securities, but the great banking and financial collapse of the derivatives market, of financial speculation, given free rein by a certain world of finance that rules in Europe, and unfortunately also in my country now? Shame on you! Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that the debate is being held within the wrong frame of reference. The debate is not about having more Europe or less Europe. Current events force us to think about a completely different Europe: participatory, united, regional. A century ago, a certain Luigi Sturzo, exiled in England and writing in the English newspapers, was more modern in his thinking than this House, which refuses to consider Europe’s problems from the point of view of territories and regions, which is to say the productive, hard-working world which is the reality for our people. Today, I would like to represent the people of the industrial triangle of agricultural production of Mantua, Ferrara and Modena, where a major seismic event has caused serious problems for one of the most important productive centres in Europe. However, aside from a few visits by Mr Tajani and Mr Barroso, which I concede are important and which I must acknowledge, there has been no debate on practical issues. There is no central intervention on the ground that responds to the expectations of these communities. This Europe thinks in a Brussels way, like our centralist states! Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when this declaration was written, perhaps no one envisaged that, when the time came to debate it, the spread would have been consistently over 500 and, God forbid, even at 600 for Spain and, God forbid indeed, for Italy too. So, we want to combat speculation. This morning, President Barroso extolled to us the virtues of his solution of creating a European banking union. This, however, actually amounts to a way for the European Union to get its hands on our savings. Banking union will not protect European savers. National governments will lose any powers that they have or want to have over their respective national banking systems, whose contents will be poured into an undifferentiated melting pot of debt. In essence, banking union is an attempt, and quite a blatant one at that, to ward off insolvency in the Spanish banking system today by using the savings of the other euro area Member States, even poor Italy, harshly enough. It seems, then, to be a preventive strike against the growing support for the real reform that could solve the problem of this bankrupt system: in other words, banking separation or the Glass-Steagall Act. Essentially, this means separating savings banks from investment banks, which is the only way to prevent savings from being used to plug gaps or being lost when the speculators fail. We are witnessing the umpteenth attempt to contain a crisis by isolating it, as if the crisis were not affecting the entire euro area. This attempt must be stopped before it is too late.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the previous government was right to put a stop to the constant migration flows in circumstances that certainly did not allow a reception worthy of the name. One reason is that the centres – and the report is very vague on this issue – are regularly destroyed by their delightful occupants, whether they are illegal or irregular migrants, and of course Europe, the muggins in this whole affair, pays for this destruction with its taxes. It is true that the European Union has provided significant aid, but part of this has been, has had to be used to rebuild what the kind third-country nationals have destroyed, at the cost of European taxpayers. And we should have the courage to set this down on paper! Just as with regard to human rights, when these missions take place, we should also be concerned about making sure that the rights of workers are respected, as I have always done when I have been involved. Police forces and staff have to be protected, given that there have been cases of murder. Therefore, the government has done the right thing in regulating this emergency and these flows efficiently and energetically, in an attempt to help protect Europe’s external borders.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that in its laudable desire to help develop, aid and, I would suggest, influence the meaning and direction of the Arab revolutions in the sense of opening up towards democracy and economic development based, obviously, on a productive economy, the Commission has failed to meet its objective by linking all of this to the possibility of exporting agricultural products, etc. Undoubtedly, some pertinent comments have been made on this subject, because if we deprive these countries of their agricultural products, we impoverish them. In addition, why do we not start thinking seriously about the role of our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in order to introduce them there as a real work-training tool, which your bureaucrats cannot do as it can only really be done by those who know how SMEs are created, and that is by our small and medium-sized enterprise owners. Let us therefore encourage them to cooperate.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before making my case I feel that I must tip my hat to Mr López Aguilar, the Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for the very balanced way he conducted the debate and for his most dignified and sober words, which I do not think anyone has dared to refute with any sincerity or good reason. This morning, rather than getting into a series of philosophical or jurisprudential debates, we ought to take a responsible look at our fellow citizens’ right to safety. In particular we need to be thinking about those people such as workers and young people who have been victims of terrorist attacks on trains, perhaps, carrying workers, young people, and so on. We need to think about the right to safety, which must prevail over our personal and political considerations and those of a Eurosceptic group which I do not think will be able to vote in favour, as Mr Batten said. The Lega Nord
 Members of the House, meanwhile, will definitely vote in favour of this measure, not because we are not receptive to the serious and well-founded concerns over privacy, but because we think that right now there is a risk of widespread and possibly nuclear terrorism hanging over the world.

Your ‘non-solutions’ are taking the ship of the European economy and finance straight towards the iceberg of large-scale international speculation, and you do not seem to be aware of it. Let us consider these ‘non-solutions’ – the ‘bail-out fund’, a body not controlled by the EU institutions, but by stakeholders of the international financial lenders, and then this gigantic – the Chair of the European Central Bank (ECB) is not here – but we need to be brave enough to say that there is a gigantic conflict of interest between taxpayers, the European citizens that we represent, and the bosses of the ECB, that is, the gentlemen from the big central banks, which, in turn, are owned by private banks and by private finance.

 Madam President, I will use my explanation of vote – having voted for this report – to draw the attention of the House, or at least what remains of the House, to a very important statement, the statement by the Nobel prize-winning economist, Joseph Stiglitz, who – we read in the periodical of the University of Columbia, where he lectures in economics – has revealed that the decisions of the European Central Bank (ECB) are made according to instructions from a little-known organisation called the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. These statements are, at the very least, worrying. Does the European Union intend to find out whether these significant and weighty statements are true? Because of all the things we find out about derivatives, one thing is certain, and that is that there is an organisation and a mysterious trafficking that allows the system of major international speculation to decide on the policies which then affect actual people, working men and women who are responsible for producing in Member States, and this does not correspond to our vision of a Europe which needs to be a Europe of people and regions, not of bankers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have this morning heard many criticisms of the French President’s electoral posturing on immigration and on Schengen. This criticism has been developed from the point of view and through the lens of populism. Fair enough. I would like to apply the same analysis to the news in all the major European dailies yesterday and today. I am referring to the important stance taken by the greatest progressive European philosopher, the elderly but very clear-sighted Mr Habermas, who has looked at the reform, the fiscal compact, from a very specific point of view. He says that this reform, this pact, should not be approved because it is like wanting to increase, or rather, fooling ourselves that we want to increase, integration among Member States without civic integration among citizens. He says that it highlights the fact that only a democratic Europe, only popular will – even expressed through a referendum I would say, but that is my opinion – could produce politically credible decisions. He calls the European Union arrogant in its dealings with citizens and dominated by speculators. I had grown used to quoting Junger, but from now on, I will quote Habermas when criticising, from a populist and democratic point of view, your bad decisions which impact on the people. Maybe they are taken by the inner circle – the inner circle of the Bilderberg or Trilateral meetings – but they are obviously not taken here. Such decisions are then imposed on the people, without caring one jot about the real economy of those who work and sweat, workers and entrepreneurs. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have heard much harsh criticism of the Dutch Government’s guidelines with regard to family reunification. These criticisms of a country, which, in the full exercise of its sovereignty, is adopting more restrictive rules on such a delicate issue, one so closely related to the fundamental issue of immigrant integration, call to mind an official government document, which will be presented today, of all days, in Rome. This is the eighth report on immigration published by the Italian National Council of Economy and Labour (CNEL) – an Italian constitutional body – showing that the Italian regions and provinces in which integration has been most fully and seriously implemented are those in the north, and particularly in the north-east: that is, precisely those regions – such as the Veneto – governed by the Northern League, a movement which many in this Chamber regard as xenophobic. This leads me to believe that it is precisely the adoption of strict rules, of a substantial immigration filter, that can lead to true integration. Moreover, this is what emerges not from a biased opinion, but from an official government document, with constitutional status in my country. Let us therefore examine these proposed rules. Are they rules fit for the Third Reich or are they reasonable norms? When an immigrant, in order to obtain family reunification, is required to demonstrate that he has a job, a certain economic stability, etc.; when strict measures are called for with regard to the shameful scam of forced marriages or marriages of convenience, all we are asking for is European standards. In short, what we want are standards compatible with European judicial culture. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an excellent and balanced report which also rightly refers to the principle of subsidiarity, and therefore recognises the important and pre-eminent role played by Member States. The report, however, also paints a picture of a multi-speed Europe. As far as my country is concerned, there are two speeds. On the one hand, there are certain cities and regions – for example, Naples and Campania – that are a source of shame for those of us who, for the moment, have identity cards issued by the Italian State, a great source of shame that we continue to denounce. On the other hand, there are the virtuous towns of Padania where we have hundreds of mayors, for example, those of the Northern League, who may be ‘barbarian dreamers’, but who are also civilised people who teach citizens and ensure that they sort their rubbish and who organise the collection and incineration of waste. This civilised part of our country is an example for Europe. So let us move forward in this direction. I welcome the petitions which also inform the European authorities of these situations which, as I have said before, in Campania also pose a threat to European tourists who risk setting foot in those areas.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Ms Alfano can look at the European Parliament website where, modestly speaking, I am described as President of the provisional government of Padania. This is an official document of the European Parliament. Also, when she leaves her mafia homeland to come up north, she can see road signs saying ‘Higher Padania’ or ‘Lower Padania’.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, complying with the rules certainly does not mean abdicating one’s sovereignty. Furthermore I do not believe that the rules referred to and described justify effectively being put in the dock, because this is the earnest desire of many groups that remained silent when democratic demonstrations were repressed elsewhere, in Belgium for example, and three parliamentarians were put in prison because they wanted to commemorate September 11th. Mr Orbán, today all the patriots among us feel Hungarian, feel proud to be Hungarian, and we envy your people for experiencing a new-found freedom after conquering it in the way that it did. Come and visit us in Padania, where you will receive a hero’s welcome, because we welcome those who defend their sovereignty. You will be welcomed as a Prime Minister who, unlike others such as our own Prime Minister, is not a servant to powerful lobbies, and perhaps this is why you do not have the favour of international finance, given that it seems to want to tie the financial hands of a free Hungary, denying it the support that is provided without question to every other country in difficulty. I believe it is time to say that perhaps our peoples should be the ones to open infringement proceedings against those who, without a popular vote, have devolved their sovereignty to others, have abandoned their sovereignty, starting with monetary sovereignty, and I invite you to defend your country's monetary sovereignty. Those of us who have abandoned it anti-democratically and without consultation find ourselves in this fine financial situation. Courage, Mr Orbán, carry on along this route.

 Mr President, I am really afraid that the meagre, disappointing results of the Brussels summit mark an historic moment: the end of the historical inevitability of European unity. That should be a cause for concern, particularly to those who have always shown themselves to be enthusiastic about Europe. The summit was, in fact, a pointless farce that has not calmed speculation, let alone stopped it. One fact certainly makes us realise that investors are afraid of a euro default soon. The European Banking Authority revealed it when it announced that some 40 banks in the European Economic Area have sold EUR 170 billion of credit default swaps (CDS) on Greek, Irish, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish bonds. The soaring CDS market is a sure sign that the markets are afraid of a default, that there is a lack of confidence, that speculation is rising and that investors are waving goodbye to Europe, thus giving speculation free rein. The euro as a currency is heading for disaster, since the markets are tending to reject it. This is the result you have achieved. Congratulations! Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a few hours ago President Van Rompuy declared that the Member States need to renounce their sovereignty in order to find a solution to rescue the economic and financial situation in the euro area and in Europe. This could prove a huge sacrifice for those who, every day, or at least during celebrations, such as the 150th anniversary of the unification of Italy, flock together and pride themselves on symbols of national unity and flags. It may be less of a sacrifice for us representatives of Padania, but I ask President Van Rompuy and the other exponents of the European elite: what will we get in return for renouncing our national sovereignty? A bluff, because where are we going to get, for example, the EUR 400-600 billion in aid that Italy is being promised, at least according to the rumours that are circulating? Certainly not from the International Monetary Fund. As regards intervention by the European Central Bank, there is the seemingly insurmountable obstacle of the Treaties, and so we ask ourselves: are these requests genuine, or are they a bluff? Are we taking things seriously? What are we talking about? I believe that Italy’s present situation, with its three-year government bonds standing at 8%, does not offer much in the way of hope, at least not in the short and medium terms. This is extremely worrying! I should also like to learn more about the Plan B that various States are rumoured to be preparing – it is even being said that Germany is preparing to mark euros with an indelible inscription that is supposed to guarantee the German character of those euros. We should like to learn more from Mr Monti’s mysterious advisors. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would say to Mr Posselt that sovereignty represents the cultural and hence political identity of the Member States. It is inalienable from the point of view of, say, belonging, and the Union that our free countries have built through European integration must never overlook, overshadow or abolish the principle of national sovereignty, which must remain in force unless we accept – which we shall never do – a certain principle: that of the construction of a superstate that destroys the identity and hence also the rights and freedoms of the individual States and the individual regions.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to talk of the usual programme of cuts to financial revenue and the fight against speculation, but I hear little of anything concrete. Instead, one should speak clearly about separating banks that are collection oriented from those that are speculation oriented, such as Goldman Sachs, which, in fact, seems to have become the calling card with which you present us the saviours of Greece and the saviours of Italy. I do not believe in a European Union which imposes these characters as a diktat
, these characters who are all authoritative members of those estimable consortia such as the Trilateral Commission or the Bilderberg Club, which also bring together the protagonists, the heads of the European Union, without admitting any outsiders, because these protagonists are from a place where secret decisions are made – decisions which then have an impact on the people. You always talk about cuts – cuts on the real economy and cuts on salaries and pensions, but never about cuts on the profits made by banks, and never about cuts on finance chiefs. What a great epilogue for our country’s celebrations for 150 years of national unity – the total sell-out of Italian sovereignty to the mighty powers of the lords of the world! Congratulations!

 Opposition to Bulgaria and Romania joining the Schengen area is due to what should be one of the mainstays of European policy: the precautionary principle. In fact, it is to be expected that some Member States, already subject to intense flows of immigration, may be put under increasing strain with the entry into the Schengen area of two countries that do not seem to have achieved sufficient control of their external borders. This is particularly clear with regard to the border between Bulgaria and Turkey. We cannot allow the free movement of citizens unless we are satisfied that this does not lead to increases in petty crime and illegal immigration, reductions in security and risks to public order. The data on the fight against organised crime in these two countries are hardly comforting for those who desire to see a serious and effective EU policy against organised crime. Mario Borghezio,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Angelides report by the US Congress Commission of inquiry has clearly demonstrated that the crisis was avoidable and has pointed the finger at public operators and the financial system, referring to those responsible by name: the Federal Reserve, rating agencies, investment banks and the five major US banks responsible have all been blamed for the ongoing crisis. Even today, these practices are going on. The Commission of inquiry’s findings were preceded by the very serious, yet unheeded, warning that was also given by the crisis committee led by the Nobel Prize-winning economist, Maurice Allais. Unfortunately, the report does not say much about all this and, bowing to the superior knowledge of those economists – nearly all of them in fact – who were unable to predict the crisis, it overlooks today what is a key proposal for those who want to get to the root of the problem: to re-establish the principles of the Glass-Steagall Act, aimed at separating the activities of traditional banks from those of investment and merchant banks – speculation, in other words – and to prohibit the creation and trading of financial derivatives. The report also disregards one of the key aspects of this powerful formula, which is necessary to ensure a financial recovery and to successfully combat corruption through the use of drastic measures. Lastly, how can one ignore the negative impact of the crisis on a serious problem such as immigration? Mario Borghezio,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate comes at a very opportune time, a time that follows an emergency that it would not be right nor intelligent to underestimate, if only we think of what is happening and, unfortunately, will perhaps continue to happen, in Libya. With these scenes in North Africa, do we want to disregard the possibility that there can be an emergency two times, 10 times, God forbid, one hundred times greater? A great French author, Jean Raspail, had predicted it many decades ago, and today we are very close to this situation. So let us give it proper consideration before criminalising a small liberal country such as Denmark, which decides to defend its own borders. I am prepared to praise borders, and we should not criminalise the existence of borders. When controls are needed and when a country considers prioritising the safety of its citizens, it is necessary to respect that decision and that should be democracy according to the rules shared by all European countries. Thus let us pay great attention to and let us reflect with great concern on the danger of a biblical exodus from Africa. This danger exists and is very close, very close indeed … (The President cut off the speaker) Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have two observations to make with regard to the own-initiative report on the common agricultural policy. The first is that the consumer prices of agricultural products must be commensurate with the costs, effort and work, but also with the production costs, if we want European consumers to be able to eat healthy products of European agriculture, of the traditional agriculture that must be preserved. The second comment concerns a signal to the competent European authorities. Are they aware of the report by the Italian Carabinieri of the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies concerning milk quotas? This report clearly shows that the milk production quota, which was supposed to have been exceeded, thus forming the legal basis for the fines levied on Italian dairy farmers, was not in fact exceeded. This is very serious, because these fines could bring thousands of farms in Padania to their knees and drive them to bankruptcy. Free Padania! Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of Greece I will say that one only needs to listen to what has been discussed to realise what stage European governance is at. In fact it is steering by sight, with no precise aims. We have not been told anything for which I would keep my fingers crossed if I were a Greek citizen – perhaps a Greek worker or a small Greek entrepreneur facing ruin. As regards immigration, I have heard Italy criticised for not wanting to accept any refugees. A few hours ago, however, Mrs Malmström issued a public statement saying that when the tragedy of the Libyan exodus began everyone undertook to receive at least 800 refugees per country. In practice, nobody is receiving them, and she highlighted the positive case of Norway. They land in Lampedusa and a few in Malta, and we are the only ones taking them in. Italy has received them. Italy. People were talking about Minister Bossi, and there is also the Home Affairs Minister, Mr Maroni: both ministers are from this racist Lega Nord
 party, which has received the refugees. Unless there is proof to the contrary, that is the truth. Lastly there is the Croatia chapter. It is very important for Croatia to join, but it is also important to remember that the Pope warned the Croats to beware of a bureaucratic, centralist structure. Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, Article 4(2) of the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union states that verification, in accordance with evaluation procedures, that the necessary conditions for the application of the Schengen acquis have been met by the new Member States is an essential requirement for the Council to decide to abolish internal border controls with those States. Now, we believe that there would be an urgent need to establish regulatory and operational conditions preventing undesirable elements, who could undermine the security of Member States, from slipping into the EU unnoticed via Bulgaria and Romania, but our assessment is that those conditions do not exist today. The reports being discussed in Parliament are not reassuring because of the grave deficiencies which still exist at air, land and sea borders, starting with the performance of border controls. It is not surprising that our police forces are faced with numerous cases of illegal immigrants coming from those two countries every day. I suggest that we need to suspend the entry process to the Schengen scheme for Bulgaria and Romania as a precaution, not least in view of the foreseeably enormous pressure on the external borders of these two countries, which are becoming the holes in the Swiss cheese that is the European Union system regarding the entry of illegal immigrants.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this issue has the merit of having brought great hypocrisy to light. The only government within the European Union that has an interior minister from a party which you define as populist is the one that has had the courage to implement the most humanitarian measure: giving 25 000 Tunisian people permission to move freely. This is because we saw in the flesh that they were not 25 000 criminals, but people who had fled Tunisia. It was an emergency, we had to face it with common sense and we have tried to help. This shows a truth, namely that in many situations the real ‘goodies’ are us, the ‘baddies’. We who affirm the need to control immigration and external borders, continue to beg Europe – as Mr Cohn-Bendit has rightly done – to spread what might become 50 000 or 100 000 refugees across its territory, because the people who flee Libya are not criminals. These are the clear words of a movement which defends territory and identity, which is against immigration because it does not want people to be uprooted, and which condemns racism and xenophobia but also hypocrisy.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, despite being a Eurosceptic, I could be in favour of a plan, in view of the 2020 Strategy, to eliminate discrimination, difficulty and marginalisation if we were really being offered incisive action by the European Commission to control the behaviour of Member States. What we have, however, are these speeches about a great future, about great control, spoken by a European Commissioner who still cannot explain to me how it is that in her country, in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, these travellers are forbidden to set up camp whereas they can instead instal themselves close to my home, in Italy and in France. Thus we talk of giving a home to travellers, whilst in some European countries, specifically that of Mrs Reding, these people cannot even set up camp. In today’s edition of the main newspaper in my country, Il Corriere della Sera
, there is an article on a parent, who does not deserve to be called a parent, a traveller, who was arrested in Italy for selling her own little girl to traffickers who wanted to sell her into prostitution. She sold her own little girl. Others send them to do other things. Often it is they who do not to send them to school, despite pressure and attention from the authorities, mediators and charities. Do we want to talk about these problems as well? Do we want to do away with these salami slices of idiotic do-goodery and realise that many of the Roma’s problems are exclusively and principally of their own making? Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank Commissioner Malmström for her hard work week after week in dealing with this epic disaster – because that is what it is. Comments have been made, not only in this House, in an attempt to reduce and make light of what our government, our country and our people have had to face. It has been, and continues to be, an emergency –humanitarian and otherwise – of exceptional dimensions. I believe that our government, and especially our people, have really come out of this well in terms of international public opinion. The people of Lampedusa behaved remarkably in firstly welcoming the migrants and then helping them out of their own pockets, and then, at a certain point, they said ‘we cannot do this any more’, because in addition to the human rights we discuss every day in this House, we must also consider the rights of peoples, including their right to maintain their identity, their activities and, naturally, not to be invaded. The migrants also include illegal immigrants, criminals released from prison. This rightly concerns the countries that must accept them. Furthermore, when the migration takes on the dimension – I repeat – of an invasion, we need to face up to the issue. We are one hundred per cent with our people, no ifs or buts. The European Union must stand up and take note, Commissioner. In addition to human rights, we must consider our rights, the rights of indigenous peoples. For this reason, we fully endorse the efforts being made by Italian Government at the moment in Tunisia, because compared to the modest figures announced by the Commissioner, the Italian Government is offering Tunisia a lot. A lot is being done and we are confident we will achieve tangible results However, we must move from words to deeds and Frontex is not doing what should have been done to put an end to this hateful traffic, because this traffic is the shame of the Mediterranean and the European Union is partly responsible. Therefore, I say put a stop to people trafficking and I say yes to a Marshall Plan for these countries. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that at such a delicate time for the finances of the Member States of Europe, as was said a short time ago, I should like to sound an alarm about an expenditure that is under discussion in the Committee on Budgets: the astonishing case of the vast expenses set aside for the House of European History. I think it would be a disgrace if it were approved. We already own the Eastman Building, but between EUR 26 million and EUR 31 million have been allocated merely for renovation costs, plus EUR 3.3 million for the plans alone. The fixed costs amount to more than EUR 3 million whilst the variable costs come to EUR 3.2 million, plus EUR 3.2 million for a 50-strong staff, EUR 2 million for security and then EUR 13.45 million are required just to manage it. I think we ought to set an example of prudent spending through our institutions. This, however, would be a disgrace. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, of course we must recognise the serious errors of the West. We in Italy have made the mistake of thinking of Mr Gaddafi as ‘our son of a bitch’, as President Roosevelt would have said, while instead, he was simply one of the many sons of … that rule over their people and now even fire on them or make other people fire on them. How on earth has no one in Parliament mentioned the responsibility of the African Heads of State or Government, who, until yesterday morning, thought of him as a brother, pampered him, sent him to the United Nations as a representative leader for the defence of human rights, even leading him to declare himself the king of kings amongst African countries, or have I got the wrong person? Now, Europe is making another mistake: it pretends to ignore an obvious danger, as a great flood of Somalis, Eritreans and others flee Libya’s borders. We need to tackle this with real energy. We should use a Marshall Plan involving the network of small and medium-sized enterprises to help these people, not send weapons. *** Mario Borghezio,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not agree with the report where it says that the Commission should dictate policy on the Roma to the Member States. This approach does not obey the principle of subsidiarity, if it is true – as indeed it is – that these measures must be conceived and carried out at local, regional and national levels, since their impact is then on the regions and their native populations. I completely agree with inclusion, not discrimination, but I am still waiting to hear from Commissioner Reding when Roma camps will finally be allowed in her country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, for if I am not mistaken, they are not allowed there. This report seems to be a little unbalanced, because so many paragraphs call for support for the Roma, be they men, women, children, the elderly (...). None of them call for any measures to severely punish those Roma who show anti-social behaviour, for example. Who stops Roma children going to school, if it is not certain Roma parents? I believe these are topics that we need to have the courage to spell out clearly, defying political correctness. It is not the syrup of do-goodism but serious, surgical measures that will enable us to lance the boil of rackets, child exploitation and organ trafficking. Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Energy 2020 is a vast programme, but we should ask ourselves if we can achieve the target of 20% renewable energy by the due date, not least because the financial crisis is slowing investment. There remains one problem: supporting solar energy. Indeed, we subsidise China, now the world’s leading exporter of solar panels, and India, the leading exporter of wind power equipment. Hence the need to support research into the production of solar panels designed and produced in Europe and to promote the adoption of economies of scale in the photovoltaic-solar sector, by introducing such devices, for example, extensively in European cities. Something very different should have been done: a pan-European energy company should have been set up to safeguard a European public service, given that the distribution networks and their infrastructures already constitute existing, natural monopolies, which should clearly come under the same management. Instead, due to over-enthusiastic economic liberalism, priority was given to other solutions that certainly do not benefit consumers or users, but the shareholders of these big monopolies. We should remember that the production of CO2
 from cars has not dropped for 150 years. We are entitled to wonder if it could be time to dust off research projects into water engines. Mario Borghezio,

 Mr President, this will certainly not be remembered as an exhilarating chapter in Parliament’s history. The criticisms and attacks rained down on the Hungarian Government, in conjunction with the EU Presidency, with regard to the Hungarian media law’s alleged total failure to comply with European legislation, have been reduced to what they really are: an instrumental and specious attempt that, apart from anything else, is based entirely on ideological bias, which is even more shameful when it is used against a country that today has the struggle for freedom encoded in its DNA – and this has indeed been the case throughout its history, which we all remember very well. The political forces that have promoted this far from exhilarating debate are still heavily weighed down by the responsibility for what is certainly not a high level political manoeuvre. Rather, it is seriously invalidated by these purely ideological overtones, and it also has the failing of casting an undeserved shadow on the European Union Presidency, which is being held for the first time – and this is certainly a great political and historical fact – by a former communist country, joined with us today in freedom.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are grateful to the Commissioner for the commitments that have been made, although it should be said that with all the salaries the European Union pays around the world – with 136 diplomatic missions – it could perhaps have realised what was happening sooner. In fact, the situation was not even foreseen by the representatives of the Socialist International, one of whose members was the nice Tunisian dictator, whose brilliant social and political management of that country led to all this. We want to learn from the Commission why it does not talk to us clearly about sharing out these people among the various European countries. It is not fair – as the coastal states have been saying for a long time – that this problem should only affect the countries that have a Mediterranean sea border with North African countries. That is a fundamental point, and it is also fundamental to remember that Frontex has very limited resources: I have heard that two experts have been sent. There is a massive crisis taking place in Lampedusa, not least in humanitarian terms, which needs to be tackled with a task force of appropriate size in order to remedy the mistakes and failures of the recent past. The situation is extremely serious and it may also get worse from a public health point of view, since water has perhaps already begun to run out in Lampedusa. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council needs to look at the fact that Europe’s production system has no defence against the volatility of oil prices on the markets, because futures markets are being held hostage to sophisticated international financial speculation, meaning that prices now have very little to do with the fundamental principles of supply and demand. The Council must set itself the goal of providing the European Union with a practical instrument with which to create a regulated market, open to selected traders and managed by a completely trustworthy European partner. This is the thrust of an Italian Government proposal to create a European oil exchange aimed at establishing a stable oil market, which would be of huge benefit to businesses and consumers. Speculators’ enthusiasm for commodities is influencing oil prices, which are no longer based on the spot market, since the cumulative effect of advances and speculative manoeuvres ends up determining supply and demand in the real market. A European exchange would transform the current ‘non-market’ of paper barrels into an efficient, regulated and monitored real market based on real barrels of oil. We ought to discuss this with the Council as well. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a law has been passed in the United States requiring the Federal Reserve to detail how much of the USD 3 300 billion rescue package has gone to which banks. I wonder whether it would be subversive to ask you to adopt the same transparency criteria, unless the finance and banking super-lobby blocks it. Let us consider the situation: what future is there for this forced Union of free countries, which is based on the stronger countries bailing out the weaker ones? Technically, do we want to acknowledge reality, which is that the euro is a virtually bankrupt currency? How can we think of forcing countries with a weak economy to use it? Is a centralised monetary policy acceptable for countries that have such decidedly diverse interest rates? Mr Trichet himself, who has denied the danger of the European Central Bank becoming insolvent, does, however, admit that one of the reasons behind increasing its capital is to face up to the credit risk, in other words, the insolvency of the bonds purchased. It is also time for new stress tests on the largest banks and to give greater weight to high-risk bank debts, as the Minister for the Economy has requested.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, in the prevailing relativism of European politics, there is one word that is taboo: Christianophobia. For many years, however, serious and often tragic reports have been coming in from reliable and indisputable sources about the persecution of Christians on several continents. Europe needs to wake up, open its eyes and take concrete action. It needs to send out clear messages, such as the one we were expecting from Baroness Ashton. She could, for example, have quoted Pope Benedict’s inspired words for the World Day of Peace a few days ago, when he pointed out that to deny religious freedom is an insult to God and to human dignity, as well as a threat to security and peace. Concrete action is needed. What are we waiting for – as I asked straight away – to send a commission to check the situation of our Coptic Christian brethren in Egypt, an officially moderate country where they have practically no fundamental human rights at all, not even in public office, in the civil service? Wake up, wretched Europe, and remember your Christian roots! Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the New York Times 
revelations, investigations are ongoing in the United States into the secret club of nine banks – one of which is European – whose executives meet every Wednesday to agree what action to take on derivatives. The Crisis Committee was completely unaware and Europe is a mere spectator. The Federal Reserve had to account for the USD 13 trillion spent to bail out the banks. Would you mind telling us what the Fed asked for the European bank rescue packages? Is it not the critical situation in the banks – and not state budgets – that requires the sum in the European rescue fund to be doubled and the preparation of a EUR 2 000 billion bail-out? What is stopping us calling on the European Central Bank to account transparently and in detail for its actions as was done in the United States for the Fed? This would put paid to suspicions that  it acted and continues to act discretionally and not in the common interest of the citizens and taxpayers of the European Union’s Member States. Why on earth have discussions never been held over the adoption of measures to impose a genuine and effective separation between commercial banks and speculative banks, as in the Glass-Steagall Act?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the responses concerning Mr Assange’s case and his imprisonment on account of his ideas of freedom are reminiscent of those of Pontius Pilate. I would like us to consider three points: 1. This is a case of fumus persecutionis
, because the accusations are very weak; 2. the United States is putting pressure on a European country to extradite, even though it has not yet specified the legal grounds for this request; 3. a citizen’s European bank accounts have been closed, meaning that he cannot receive any financial assistance in Europe from his supporters. What is more, all the statistics confirm that the European public is in favour of these principles of freedom, that it wants Internet freedom, that it is in favour of freedom, despite the doubts and the problems that have emerged in the wake of this initiative, which I personally do not fully support. Nevertheless, we would like President Barroso to state what the limits are and what the protection of human rights and of freedom of expression is really and truly founded on. Are we looking at a virtual Guantánamo here? Are we facing the threat of an Orwellian total censorship of the Internet? That is the danger, and we need answers on this matter. It is also important to keep a check on Mr Assange’s prison conditions, because in Italy, not even Mafia members are held in complete isolation. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ears of the President of the European Central Bank, Mr Trichet, must really be burning as this debate continues. If we were in the ancient Roman senate, a senator would surely stand up in his toga and say to Mr Trichet: ‘Quousque tandem abutere
, Trichete, patientia nostra?
’ – how long are you going to try our patience, Mr Trichet? In effect, we must ask ourselves whether the right road is to avoid the dissolution of the euro – a very difficult task – or instead prevent the rescue of the euro from ruining the economies of our Member States after the europhile policies of Mr Prodi and so on have destroyed our industries, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, in Padania for example, bringing only redundancies and unemployment benefit. Why should the countries which are surviving the crisis be bled dry to the tune of almost EUR 100 billion to save Ireland which, with its policy of 12.5% business tax,, has until now been competing unfairly with the other countries? Where was European governance if, one month after passing its stress tests, the Anglo Irish Bank plunged to a deficit of EUR 8 billion? Where was Mr Trichet? Are we sure that the Irish bailout does not violate the Treaty of Maastricht? Fortunately there is a constitutional court in Germany that will declare that the absorption of another country’s deficit onto Germany’s books is unconstitutional. So it is time to say bye-bye euro, bye-bye euro. Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should like to express my sincere and earnest thanks to the rapporteur, whose skills and rigour have been put to good use in guaranteeing Member States that granting free passage to Taiwanese nationals and abolishing visas will not cause problems for the European Union. I am not so convinced about the latest work regarding Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania. Now there is even talk of abolishing visas for Turkey. In those situations, I am not convinced that the Commission and Parliament have done their job well, namely: ensuring the safety of European citizens. Therefore, I applaud the report and the vote in the European Parliament – which will surely be positive – all the more. History is not impermanent. People of a certain age remember what it was that what was once called Nationalist China represented for decades: it was a banner of freedom. The West must not forget who defended the principles of liberty when they were under threat elsewhere. Still now, in terms of human rights, I think a basic distinction must be made. The Chinese of Taiwan are therefore also welcome in my home region of Padania. The presence of such important and skilled individuals in the region already provides ample illustration of the ability of Taiwanese people to integrate into our society. Unlike other countries, Taiwan also has the merit of not exporting socio-political messages against the principles of liberty, the protection of human rights and respect for ethnic and religious minorities to the European Union together with its goods. The citizens of Taiwan are therefore welcome in the European Union and in Padania. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply wanted to call the attention of the President of the European Parliament to a judgment made several days ago. It is a matter that surely falls under the capacities of the Commissioner, to whom I extend my greetings. In my opinion, it is a very serious judgment, because it relativises the content of a very important European Union directive on terrorism. In fact, I believe that it is not possible to support an extensive attitude to protecting citizens who request the right of asylum and the right to be recognised as a refugee to those who belong to terrorist organisations. If this principle were to become accepted, as it did in this extremely serious decision of the European Court of Justice, we shall give many terrorists the chance to benefit from protection that they do not deserve. Too many people have died in Europe as a result of acts of terrorism to allow a situation of this type. I therefore urge the Commission to modify the directive so as to avoid extensive and indecent interpretations of the statement that the European Union rightly made in the fight against terrorism.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should have listened to the advice of the Nobel laureate, Maurice Allais, who called for a clear separation between business banks, credit banks and speculative banks, in accordance with the principles of the Glass-Steagall Act, which is not discussed in this report. As far as the proposal to tax European taxpayers is concerned, my response is ‘No tax in Europe!’ If this European Union proposal goes ahead, you can rest assured that we will have our own Tea Party here as well: there will be a mass protest. The European public has no intention of paying for a service they are not getting and they are perfectly right. We are continuing to fund the banks. However, what are the banks doing in the midst of this economic and financial crisis? They are buying securities, even ones that contain dodgy derivatives and so on. They are still buying them. And what is the ECB doing while this is going on? The ECB – set up to be an unchallengeable body – is letting it go on. It seems clear to me that this is a Europe for bankers. If even the Masonic leaders claim this to be true, I do not see why we cannot claim it too. We believe that there is only one way to combat speculation effectively: transactions carried out at the same time as negotiations are paid for, and only in cash. Mrs Merkel dared to say it and she was shouted down. There must be some reason for that. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Madam President, this is an important and significant report for the protection of women. The European institutions, however, suffer from the major fault of not practising what they preach. Last Friday and Saturday, a meeting attended by the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, the President of Parliament and President Van Rompuy was held with dignitaries from the most important European Masonic lodges, yet not a single word was said about the fact that most of these lodges do not allow women to join. More seriously, the meeting was held inside the European Parliament, behind closed doors, and not even Parliament’s own staff were allowed in. All that stands in contrast to the principles of transparency that should govern all activities of the European institutions. Mario Borghezio,

 Mr President, we will vote against this report not least because the rapporteur proposes exerting pressure on the Commission and the Council to speed up the process of visa liberalisation for Kosovo. Do we realise what we are discussing? Do we realise that Kosovo is finding it difficult to reintegrate the thousands of Roma who sought asylum in Germany? This is an extremely sensitive situation for the entire European Union. Do we realise that visa liberalisation – which I have heard said will be used only by students and respectable people, even though I personally do not agree at all with that optimistic statement – will simply mean that Europe becomes a hotbed of Roma? We really do not need this, considering the serious problems we are facing with integration and resolving the extremely severe problem of the Roma. As far as Albania is concerned, I would like to point out that the Commission again proposed in May that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina should be able to allow their citizens to circulate within the Schengen area with electronic passports. The proposal was not, however, taken forward due to Albania’s shortcomings with regard to reintegrating repatriated Albanians. I believe that security and control issues exist that weigh on visa liberalisation like boulders. We need to think about this very carefully: visas are necessary, and how! Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also award the prize for hypocrisy to Mrs Reding, who forgot to describe – at least according to the texts – the situation of the Roma in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, where the problem of expelling Roma does not exist simply because the setting up of Roma camps is not allowed by law; it is forbidden. Thus, there are many different ‘Europes’. I hope that this is an indication of what is to come: at this European Council, at last, a Head of State or Government felt compelled to teach the European Commission a clear lesson in patriotism. The Commission must not, not even through its Commissioners, allow itself to insult a Member State, in particular, a Member State such as France which could give us all a lesson on the concepts of freedom and humanity. There is a huge difference between what you call European law and the law of the peoples. European law is perhaps the right to enter other people’s houses and steal, not to send your children to school and to exploit them, as asserted not by racist populism, but – according to Le Monde
 – as asserted by the Prime Minister of Romania during the ‘déjeuner de fiel
’ – the ‘lunch as bitter as bile’ – on 16 September. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we did not vote for the motion for a resolution by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which is certainly more balanced, because of one key point to which we wish to draw your attention: the call for the European Commission, for Europe, to speed up the process to integrate Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen area. We feel – and we already sounded this alarm at the time of enlargement – that these countries have not yet adopted strict control policies for the issue of identity cards and recognition of nationality. Are the Commission and Parliament aware that in these countries certificates can be obtained with great ease from non-European countries enabling, thanks to the freedom of movement, illegal entry into the Schengen area? We must pay close attention to this matter, and it is completely irresponsible not to have done so, and to be pressing for the enlargement of the Schengen area, contrary to common sense. Lastly, I would like to voice my hope that, when we next meet, at least one of the do-gooder MEPs who are so supportive of the Roma will report that he or she has taken in – they can afford this on an MEP’s salary – a nice Roma family, and are feeding a few extra mouths. It is not hard to show with actions, instead of just with words, that you are a do-gooder. Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to the attacks against the French Government, like those against the Italian Government previously, and also to some very strong attacks against the Commission. These accusations are completely spurious in actual fact. I have not heard any reference to the statistics supplied by the French police authorities showing that, in the 18 months following the exodus of Roma from Bulgaria and Romania, the number of thefts rose by more than 250%. In this connection, perhaps Romania and Bulgaria should be forced to answer some questions, after they were very irresponsibly allowed to enter the European Union without this problem having first been resolved. We must speak frankly to those people, too, who come over as guests of other states. We must tell them to respect the citizens of their host states and not enter their homes illegally and perform acts unbecoming of a guest. They must be respected and they must be protected – in the words of those who speak of high principles – but we must also consider the victims of their crimes: the other honest citizens of the European Union who, perhaps with good reason, do not always enjoy having the Roma as their neighbours. These are the uncomfortable facts that the majority of citizens and people think and that certain do-gooders do not have the courage to admit, because, the truth is, sometimes you also have to have the political courage to say ...

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am very pleased that you are the guardian of the treaties. In actual fact, the Commission also guards the Commission’s own secrets so well that it is very difficult for us MEPs, for example, to obtain extensive and, above all, in-depth information about what takes place behind closed doors in your meetings, despite the fact that the Commissioners have not been elected by our peoples and should therefore feel all the more bound to observe their duty of communication and transparency. For example, I am still waiting for an answer – and not the ironic answer I have been given – to my question so that I can circulate the truth in the newspapers. Is or was President Barroso a member of the Bilderberg Club or not? Does he frequent it or not? The answer I was given, and which I published in my press releases, in other words, was as follows: ‘Mr Borghezio, you know more than us about the Bilderberg Group’ is a little odd, and I would therefore like more information on the subject. For example, what information has the international press given on the background to the financial crisis? The Lisbon strategy was quoted; that is very interesting. It is like looking at a set of Chinese boxes when you come to establish the true owners of the large financial groups to which the leading newspapers and mass media belong; they could be based in tax havens for all we know. I believe that you would do very well to champion an initiative aimed at really disclosing what goes on behind the scenes of politics, finance and the economy. These are very interesting subjects and have widespread relevance to citizens, who have a right to be kept fully informed. I note, and would emphasise, the silence of the left wing with regard to the Bilderberg Club and the Trilateral Commission. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the measures for the supervision of the European financial system must – and this should be better emphasised in the report – have a priority objective, which must be very clear and strongly supported: to establish strict rules to control the derivatives market as this is one of the main causes, if not the main cause, of the current financial crisis. Here, instead, we are, above all, designing a centralised institution, to some extent copied from the model of the ECB. This is not good, because at this point it is not known or fully clear what the role of the national supervisory bodies will be – the Banca d'Italia
 in our country. It seems that they are being watered down somewhat to the role of agent, which is not a particularly well-defined role. Instead, oversight should begin in our countries. In Italy, for example, it happens via a system of local branches which can monitor situations well. Furthermore, why should the headquarters of the European agency be in Frankfurt? Who decided that? Based on what criteria, if not in order – I would say – to make it conformant with the European Central Bank? We propose it be sited in Milan, for example, which is a major financial and banking market, including from a geo-economic point of view due to its position at the centre of Europe. I believe that this plan should generally go much deeper, with measures that require courage to implement, such as introducing a separation between commercial and investment banks in European legislation, based on the principles of the old US law. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, while we are discussing these various issues, there is a lively debate under way in the United States on what I consider to be a crucial question, namely, a return to the principles of the Glass-Steagall Act and the separation of ordinary banks from the speculating banks that caused the extremely serious problems for which our economies and peoples are paying a heavy price. While solutions are being put to us here, 10 days ago, behind closed doors in the secrecy of the Bilderberg Club meetings, a large number of senior bureaucrats and European political leaders came together, probably to lay down instructions for the directives that will subsequently be presented to the European Parliament, which will have no other choice but to consider them. Moreover, this morning I heard Mr Barroso’s appeal to provide aid to our Greek friends. I would not want the aid mainly going to his friend, the shipowner Spiros Latsis. There is a clear conflict of interest here for Mr Barroso, who should account for this. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how long will the euro last in its current form? Are we perhaps headed towards its destructuring within a year or two? I do not agree with creating a new supplementary deficit of EUR 750 billion to cover an earlier one or that these measures are sufficient for building the socio-economic future of 500 million Europeans, nor do I agree with the dogma of saving the euro as it is, because it should be done by keeping the euro as low as possible and reducing the interest rate to inject capital into productive investments for our industries, which are gasping for air, rather than into public financing. I do not agree with the European Commission expecting to review and audit the accounting of Member States’ budgets before the national parliaments: farewell to sovereignty. I disagree with an economic and financial strategy that fails to contemplate specific needs. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, an industrial policy that focuses exclusively on companies operating internationally and using advanced technologies is not the best route to success. We must not forget the whole small and medium enterprise sector, including both small-scale manufacturers and retailers. Innovation policy should be aimed at them also. In particular, this strategy should guarantee conditions that place small and medium-sized enterprises on an equal footing with their competitors outside the EU by adopting safeguard clauses and strong, effective measures to combat the extremely serious problem of counterfeiting, including through effective trade defence instruments. It is important that governance of the Europe 2020 strategy should not rest in the hands of the Commission alone, but should be carried out at different levels, including the national and macro-regional levels. We need to start formulating a policy and strategy that focus on the local level and the reality of manufacturing on the ground, and I would like to stress here the need for attention to be paid to the manufacturing situation in Padania. In other words, we are asking for more attention to be paid to the actual manufacturing situation on the ground, focusing, in particular, on the SME structure, as I said, which is the backbone of manufacturing in every country in Europe and is therefore where the real hope for the future of manufacturing and development of the European Union lies. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that we are here discussing and examining the content of this Europe 2020 strategy, while in Athens workers are dying, and a country, a nation is on the edge of a precipice, paints a rather telling, or, I would go so far as to say, grotesque, picture of European politics. It is absolutely remarkable that in a situation of this kind, the Commission does not feel that it should take a good, long look at itself, because it is not as though it does not realise that this crisis, which in some respects has now reached, I would say, dramatic proportions, is a consequence of many serious mistakes, as demonstrated by the failure of the Lisbon strategy. Many mistakes and one defendant in the dock: the euro. You come here saying, in all your statements, that Greece is a one-off, but will you be saying that when – although let us hope not – another similar situation arises, for example in Spain: will that be another one-off? We here are a bit tired of hearing the one-off excuse: the subprime crisis was also a one-off. It is hard to believe and very difficult to accept what the Commission is saying when the European Union has not yet decided to clean up Europe’s banks and to tell savers, manufacturers and the real economy how much muck there still is in European banks, in order to develop a strategy. We must keep these points in mind and remember that a serious strategy must be based on the real economy, on the small and medium-sized enterprise system, and naturally it must give a responsible role to workers, through their participation, too.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, procedure is one thing: we delegate choices regarding trade policy to the Commission, and that is only right. However, the substance of the matter is something else. What we, the group of the Northern League, representing the regions of Northern Italy, are worried about are the decisions on trade, the progressive reduction of duties, the lack of any industrial policy, and concession of advantages to multinationals. In other words, it is acceptable that Parliament should delegate decisions to the Commission at a technical level, but it is not a good thing that we are slaves and victims of the outdated economic and industrial policy of the World Trade Organisation, which favours the large foreign powers, making no effort to defend our manufacturers. I am not sure if you are aware of the number of small and medium-sized enterprises that are closing in Lombardy and Veneto due to trade agreements that offer no protection to our products. It would be a mistake to believe that research and innovation alone will take us very far. There is a real risk that we will become like the countries of Eastern or Northern Europe, the United States or Asia, where all of the shopping malls now belong to the large multinationals. Therefore, as Parliament, we should delegate the power to adopt these acts regarding trade policy to the Commission, in the hope, however, that the Commission will revise, modernise and defend a manufacturing and trade system that will otherwise disappear.

 With all due respect for your work and that of others, I invite you to come and see for yourself the extent to which agreements with the World Trade Organisation have a positive or negative effect on enterprises in Northern Italy. In half an hour we will be speaking about the Chinese photovoltaic industry. I think that Europe, as it is structured today, counts for little or nothing. I do not know whether the individual states would count for more. What I do know is that the trade policy pursued in this regard by the European Commission is a complete failure for our enterprises. A completely free market is of no use to anyone. Matteo Salvini,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I feel ashamed. While enterprises are closing and workers being made redundant, you come here and tell us we are the most open market in the world and that this investigation will issue its findings in nine months. Somebody here seems to have forgotten why he is being paid a salary by the European taxpayers. If Mr De Gucht says that the trade war is not China’s fault, that is nonetheless an indication that someone has declared war. We can hardly argue with the fact that many enterprises are closing and laying off their workers, or is this not the case in Brussels? Instead of MEPs, I would like to see here today those workers who have lost their jobs and those businesspeople who have seen 30 or 40 or 50 years of work go up smoke for reasons that are obvious to us all. Does anyone here really doubt that China engages in unfair trade, exploits workers, illegally subsidises its enterprises and ignores environmental issues? Does anyone have any questions that cannot be resolved in nine days rather than nine months? I am ashamed to represent a Europe that by the end of this investigation will have no photovoltaic industry left. For some people, the words ‘import duty’ are taboo. Well then certain people should either impose import duties to get things done, or otherwise resign, because nine months is too long to spend investigating the obvious. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by Ms Collin-Langen. The text adopted by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is a balanced text that seems to take account of the real reasons why some of the Directive’s objectives have not been achieved. However, I would have given greater consideration to the impact this crisis has had on citizens and the consequent widespread mistrust of consumer credit. Within the European Union, the situation can vary significantly from Member State to Member State.

 I decided to vote in favour of this report because the measure will simplify the current regulatory framework and will introduce new administrative and technical requirements concerning the environment, safety and market surveillance for two- and three-wheeled vehicles and quadricycles. The issues that, to my mind, require further attention are identification of the scope of the proposal for a regulation to remove some inconsistencies and reflect the categories of manufacture, make the timetable for application simple and clear to prevent problems for manufacturers with having to introduce the new features required by the regulation too quickly, and introduction of environmental requirements that manufacturers do not find it excessively difficult to comply with.

 I decided to vote in favour of this measure because it updates the rules on the type-approval of agricultural and forestry vehicles with a view to ensuring the functioning of the internal market, while at the same time providing for a high level of environmental protection and road safety. One aspect worthy of mention is access to vehicle repair and maintenance information. The justifiable need to provide information for the repair of vehicles has been balanced by the need to protect information valuable to competitors, especially in Asia, who want to copy the best technical solutions in the sector.

 I hardly need to say that the single market has certainly benefited citizens and businesses. For this reason I voted in favour. The problem, however, is that, unlike our competitors such as the US, the trade policy pursued by the European Commission with third countries does not put us in a position to protect our interests. Similarly, the single market cannot be invoked as the solution to every problem in Europe. Often it is actually poorly conceived directives, like the Services Directive, that give our workers and businesses enormous problems. Bring on the single market, but let it not be an instrument designed solely around the needs of multinationals. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted against this proposal and I am pleased that there was a majority of MEPs who shared my position. The relevant committee for this matter asked the Council to present a female candidate and, having been ignored, reacted negatively to the recommendation to appoint Yves Mersch as a Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB). I do not have sufficient information to say whether Mr Mersch deserves this post or not, but I cannot fail to take into consideration the fact that appointing a man would mean that there would be no women on the ECB’s Executive Board until 2018.

Some European Court of Justice rulings and the strict rules imposed by the World Trade Organisation severely restrict our freedom to legislate to protect European industry and workers against counterfeit goods and goods produced without respect for social and environmental standards.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has been awarded a Nobel Prize, no less! If only its citizens could hear some of the speeches made in this Parliament. Where is all this dialogue, this respect for human rights and tolerance? I hope that the Commission presses ahead with its project that from a technical, economic and social point of view is useful for dialogue, useful to consumers, useful to enterprises and useful to workers in Israel, be they Jews, Christians or Muslims. Israel has provided us with a model to strive for and to compete with in terms of pharmaceutical research, The sad thing is that we do not hear the same kind of indignation in this House from hypocritical left-wing parties when human rights are ignored in other parts of the world, in North Africa, in the Middle East.

Under this agreement some of the benefits of the internal market would be extended to aligned sectors and facilitate access to the Israeli market, removing technical barriers to trade for industrial products.

Other important questions are also dealt with, such as removal of trade barriers, the introduction of measures to ensure better market access, including for investment, the protection of intellectual property rights, the opening up of public procurement markets to ensure full reciprocity and convergence on mutual recognition of regulatory standards.

On several occasions, Parliament asked to have the issue of geographical indications included in ACTA, but Commissioner De Gucht was not able to negotiate this with his counterparts. The doubts over the infringement of fundamental rights are too serious to approve such an agreement.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as usual, I fear that someone is wasting your time and trying to hoodwink citizens, entrepreneurs and Internet users in Europe, in Italy and, as far as I am concerned, in Padania. We are debating an agreement involving just a handful of countries, one that excludes 95% of countries engaged in exporting counterfeit goods, so effectively it is much ado about nothing. The Commissioner talks about defending businesses and jobs, and then goes and signs free trade agreements with Morocco, Korea, Pakistan and India. We remove tariffs, barriers and protections to help banks, insurance companies and multinationals from Northern Europe, and then try to muzzle the web by selling it as a way of defending our businesses. No one is falling for it any more, Commissioner. Go and inspect the ports in northern Europe, the port of Rotterdam for example, if you want to fight counterfeiting; do not try and gag anyone. If you really want to do something tangible about it, take the first plane to China, India or Indonesia and bring home something tangible, or else resign. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted in favour of this report. This is a big step forward in protecting people with coeliac disease. The Commission’s proposal has been improved by the Members’ amendments, especially those by Italian Members. There is profound ignorance about coeliac disease in various Member States: it is neither a fad, nor an allergy. Coeliac disease is an illness and the words ‘gluten free’ on food products cannot be trivialised as a simple claim or allergen. Coeliacs cannot eat any gluten whatsoever.

 The motion for a resolution, which is the result of the work carried out by the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, is very interesting and contains references which I believe will be useful in helping the Commission understand possible future single market scenarios. However I voted against the resolution because I believe there are premises in the text that are wrong. Rating the single market too highly as a solution to the crisis or claiming that its completion would automatically lead to growth throughout the Union means saying things that are not true.

 I voted against Mr Fjellner’s report, even though the Commission’s proposal is, without doubt, an improvement on the previous scheme of generalised tariff preferences, and despite the fact that the Council introduced a number of additional restrictions for the GSP+ scheme during negotiations with Parliament. Unfortunately, however, a country such as Pakistan – a serious threat to EU textile businesses, which continue to hold strong – would soon be able to benefit from the GSP+ scheme.

 I obviously voted in favour of the report. On the very day of the terrible events that affected Liguria and Tuscany a few months ago, I submitted an urgent question to the European Commission to draw attention to the tragedy, occurring, in particular, in Genoa, the Cinque Terre region and neighbouring areas. I voted with the moving images of the altruistic spirit of the ‘Angels of the Mud’ who helped the affected populations still fresh in my mind, and with the memory of my sorrow for those who, in those dreadful days, lost their lives or a loved one still vivid. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 The mobilisation of funds to help the regions affected by the tragic events in Liguria is a necessity. The European Union Solidarity Fund is a very important instrument that brings Europeans much closer together than many political or legislative initiatives. When casting my vote in favour, my thoughts turned to those people who were bereaved and lost everything in the floods. Given that these events are happening more and more frequently, I think that the time has come, in collaboration with the European Commission, to establish a programme to identify suitable instruments with which to invest in innovation and prevention in Europe.

 I voted in favour of the report. I think it is right that at last we have a general legislative instrument valid for any future macro-financial assistance for third countries. I supported the main proposals made by the rapporteur, even though I did not share his concern regarding the need to involve our Parliament more fully in future measures of macro-financial assistance. In my opinion, the procedure initially proposed by the European Commission, which provided for the involvement of the Council but not of the European Parliament could have been maintained. However, the members of the Committee on International Trade preferred to bring in changes that will make negotiations with the Council very long and difficult to resolve. I express my hope, in any case, that the rapporteur will be successful in the negotiations with the colegislator. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted for the report and I congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work. The problems that China creates for our production system are well known: for many years now, my political movement, Lega Nord
, has been expressing its concern over the relocation of our enterprises to Asia, the social dumping that adversely affects our workers, and the risks associated with the arrival on our territory of products that are dangerous and do not comply with our rules. For these reasons, it is right that the European Commission should make a serious, concrete commitment to demanding reciprocity and setting in motion a genuine strategy to protect our production system and revitalise a genuine industrial policy.

 I want to vote against this measure and I would like to explain the political reasons that led me to make this decision. We need to give a signal to the European Commission so that it will represent us effectively at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Yet another European defeat in a dispute with China at the WTO would today force Parliament to delete an article in our Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation. It is wrong not to stand up more strongly to international bodies like the WTO. It is wrong not to defend our industry. It is wrong not to ask China for reciprocal openings for our products and services. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 My vote in favour of this measure is not just a duty. In actual fact, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules require the European Union to remove the rules imposing restrictions on the import of products from other members of the WTO. Since Russia has now become a member of the WTO, unless we had voted to repeal certain rules today, we would have been subject to certain sanctions which would have damaged our production and our businesses.

 I voted with absolute conviction against this report. I understand Mr Rinaldi’s position, but I do not share his enthusiastically positive stance on the outcomes of the so-called Arab Spring. I do not agree on his call for the creation of a free trade area with the countries of North Africa, which would seriously damage our textiles industry and agriculture, which have already been hampered by an unprecedented crisis. Lastly, I do not approve of the general tone of the report, which focuses exclusively on protecting and promoting the interests of the other party, while completely forgetting to refer to and defend legitimate EU trading interests. It seems more like a report by the Committee on Development than one by the Committee on International Trade. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted in favour of this agreement, as I did for the similar measure relating to Liberia. However, I remain doubtful about the actual possibility of its implementation by the Central African Republic. The European Commission will be responsible for monitoring in order to ensure that the forestry heritage of this country does not suffer irreversible damage and that a stop is put to illegal logging, a real scourge afflicting the entire African continent. In any case, my vote in favour was also meant as a vote of faith in the two parties to the agreement. I sincerely hope that the forest law enforcement, governance and trade (FLEGT) measures will prove to be effective and useful for preserving nature and creating development in certain areas of the planet.

 I am delighted to vote in favour of this agreement. However, I have doubts about Liberia’s actual ability to respect the commitment it has made with Europe.

Therefore, my vote in favour was also meant as a vote of faith in the two parties to the agreement.

 I am, of course, voting in favour of this measure. The amendments to the rules of procedure of the International Rubber Study Group are a mere formality.

 I voted in favour of these amendments to the European Fisheries Fund. The measure will involve no cost to the EU because the funds advanced to Member States in economic difficulties will be offset before the end of the programme.

It is a rightful act of solidarity. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I totally support this measure, which definitively ends a trade war that has been ongoing for many years between the EU, on the one hand, and the US and Canada, on the other.

 I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for her success in proposing numerous amendments within the Committee on International Trade to a proposal from the Commission that contained some highly unacceptable passages such as the extension of time limits for reaching the decision to introduce trade duties. These actions are necessary in order to safeguard our production system and therefore require speed, not more bureaucracy or time-wasting. I voted in favour of this very technical measure, also because it was necessary to bring these regulations in line with the new comitology procedure. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted in favour of this resolution because it is always necessary to underline the fact that trade with our international partners must always take place in a context of respect for human rights. In this case, the Committee on International Trade has prepared a text that precisely underlines the details of the serious issue of child labour in cocoa production. It will be difficult to eradicate such phenomena, but it is the duty of the European institutions to try and do so, including with resolutions such as this. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted for this report. The text lists many of the problems relating to the application of the rules on waste management. The references to respect for the principle of subsidiarity are quite correct, as – even more so – are the references to the major interests that see the Mafia and organised crime in general involved in waste disposal, especially in some regions. Everyone is monitoring the situation in Campania, but we must also underline that in Italy – especially in northern regions around the Po, but also in some cases in the South – there are instances of excellent management of the waste cycle, which can set an example for the whole of Europe. In order to achieve these results, it is very important that local citizens improve their selection of local politicians. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 As I already mentioned in yesterday’s debate, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Cutaș. However, I demand that the European Commission should act on this important vote and quickly exert all necessary pressure on the government of Uzbekistan to put paid to the use of children in the cotton harvest. Europe cannot enter into agreements with countries that act in such a way. Cotton is a very important raw material for the textiles industry in my Padania. However, we have to insist that it be harvested in accordance with human rights. Children should be in school, not working in fields. Matteo Salvini,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we will support this report and we thank the rapporteur for his work. I am the seventh or eighth person to take the floor to say the same thing. If the Commission really believes that what we debate in Parliament counts for something, it should take action tomorrow, not with a report, or a threat, or a proposal for a measure. If it is true, and here the whole House is saying the same thing, from left to right – that thousands of children are forcibly sent to work in the cotton fields (and I think that the evidence now proves that it is so), then we vote in favour of this report. Yet if, tomorrow morning, no practical action against the government of Uzbekistan is taken by the European Commission, it will mean that we have lost, and we have wasted our time here tonight, as well as helping to destroy the credibility of Parliament, the Commission and the European institutions, and that we have several hundred thousand children on our consciences. Children who, if the debate continues so slowly, will continue next year to do what they have been forced to do for decades. Therefore, we support this report. However, I hope that at eight, when the debate ends, and with tomorrow’s vote, the problem will not be shelved, and I hope that the Commission will act, today rather than tomorrow.

 I voted for this report. The rapporteur, Mr Sturdy, and the Committee on International Trade (INTA) have done excellent work. In any case, it is right to emphasise that certain states may raise barriers to legitimately protect their own economy and their own consumers. Of course, the text is lacking one important consideration which is that at some point, even the European Union might need to start protecting its own fabric of production rather than limiting itself to only requesting reductions in duties and the removal of non-tariff barriers. In my opinion, a real trade policy should not limit itself to this alone and should consider the interests of European small and medium-sized enterprises first and foremost. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I would like to explain my vote in favour of the report on the modernisation of customs, because this is an important and much-needed text that enables the Commission to postpone the entry into force of a regulation adopted in 2008 and slated for implementation in 2013. Our delegation would have preferred to purge the text of references to the non-preferential origin principle, which we do not support, has nothing to do with the text of the report, and which we will fight if it is put forward again during the debate on the legislative proposal.

 I would like to declare my vote in favour of Ms McClarkin’s report on the implementation of the Professional Qualifications Directive. There is no doubt that the ability to carry out one’s profession in all Member States is a significant feature of the internal market. It is important to implement the quite correct precautions outlined in the report in regard to the health care sector, third-country professional qualifications and the need for a high level of linguistic competence, particularly for some professional categories whose work involves being in close contact with patients or clients.

 The purpose of this text is to provide a right and necessary basis for guiding the Commission on consumer protection. It is a complex and important issue that thus requires further consideration in the future. The report has brought to light important principles such as the importance of the consumer’s role in developing EU policies and the dissatisfaction being shown by citizens, with increasing concerns over sectors such as finance and insurance. Mr Triantaphyllides’ report also includes important points on the need to bolster consumer protection in sectors which are currently growing quickly, such as e-commerce. That is why I voted in favour of this text. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I would like to express my vote in favour of Mr Creutzmann’s report. The online gambling market is in a state of continual growth and its turnover has now exceeded EUR 10 billion. For these reasons, the issue of protecting consumers, specifically those who are weaker and more at risk, is extremely delicate and important. At the same time, we must ensure that the revenue generated for Member States through taxation of online gambling is not curtailed by the worrying presence of illegal gambling games which, other than providing an opportunity to launder enormous sums of illegally obtained money, place less cautious consumers in grave danger. I believe that it is of fundamental importance to ensure that national regulators work in close collaboration with each other. Greater exchange of information across Europe could prevent cases whereby unregulated providers exploit regulatory gaps and play national regulatory bodies off against each other. For this reason, the Commission and the Member States should take immediate steps to protect European consumers from bogus providers. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for having made such a complex subject and report accessible to everyone. I welcome the document, as it invites the Commission to simplify and safeguard the different legal practices in the various Member States, as well as the refusal to introduce new rules for tenders below European thresholds. Furthermore, the report dedicates a lot of space to the protection of small and medium-sized enterprises in respect of their ability to access European contract tenders. Finally, I would like to underline that simplifying legislative procedures not only offers many advantages to local administrators; it also helps to eradicate the wasting of funds. I therefore invite the Commission to continue along this route towards improving legal clarity. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

I would like to explain my strong opposition to this report, not just for the specific topic discussed in the text – the mutual evaluation tool, in relation to which, despite the delays and inconsistencies, it is possible to discern some positive aspects – but to the Commission’s attitude to such a complex issue. Unfortunately, in fact, the report only examines a marginal part of the Services Directive that is of little importance. Meanwhile, it fails to address the serious problems that the directive is causing, such as the lack of consumer protection, the little autonomy left to local authorities, and the calling into question of small manufacturing operations on which entire families have depended for generations.

 I voted in favour of implementing the United Nations Protocol on arms trafficking, which has, in any case, already been ratified by Italy.

I feel duty-bound to vote in favour of renewing trade preferences with Balkan countries, including Serbia, that currently have a stabilisation and association agreement in place with the European Union. Firstly, I feel this way on the basis of the Commission’s favourable take on simplifying commercial agreements with countries, such as China, that do not have association agreements with the European Union and whose products often undermine our competitiveness. Secondly, the text on which we reached final agreement offers the possibility of limiting the damage that allowing access for these goods could cause to our market. Matteo Salvini,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a snapshot of a disaster: it talks about a strategy for Europe, but we see no strategy. It is a snapshot of a hopeless disaster. Thank you for the report, which offers no way out at all. Somebody will have to explain to me what the Commission’s farsightedness entails. The details put forward here actually portray a debacle of what Europe is not. The prevailing interests are those of certain Northern European countries that want to liberalise everything and trade, regardless of social dumping and the imbalances we have with our so-called partners, but without any interest or protection for our small and medium-sized enterprises. It is essentially British and German interests that are being defended both by the Commission and by the report. I smile when I see in the report that the Member States and the Commission are being urged to communicate better, since the people of the European Union are sick to death of globalisation because of the loss of productivity. If, in your view, we can solve things by communicating better, then we really have not understood where to go.Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Enlargement is a very complex question and should be analysed from all points of view, from economic considerations to geopolitical repercussions and potential social impact. Above all at a time of economic crisis I think that it is advisable to be as prudent as possible and to learn from the mistakes of the past. I do not share the rapporteur’s view that the EU should launch a campaign in favour of enlargement in the candidate countries, since I do not believe that enlargement has proved successful in all cases or that visa liberalisation has always proved beneficial.

 Italy applied for financial assistance from the EU Solidarity Fund following the series of earthquakes that struck on 20 May 2012. A heavy earthquake with a magnitude of 5.9 on the Richter scale affected wide parts of Northern Italy and caused severe damage in many towns and villages, in particular around the epicentre, mostly in the provinces of Modena and Ferrara in the region of Emilia-Romagna. On 29 May, a second strong earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 on the Richter scale occurred with the epicentre slightly to the west. Both events were followed by several serious aftershocks. The earthquakes caused 27 deaths, an estimated 350 people were injured and over 45 000 people had to be evacuated. The Italian authorities estimated total damage at EUR 13 273 736 063. Despite the financial difficulties affecting the 2012 budget, I think it is necessary and right for Parliament to send a signal to the victims of these disasters to help them at this difficult time.

 I support the adoption of this trade Protocol between the EU and Israel, not just because Israel offers an interesting development opportunity to our enterprises in the fishery and agricultural sectors, but more particularly because I am opposed to exploiting trade relations with Israel for political ends. Bringing political pressure to bear in matters of trade on the one hand damages the interests of our enterprises and on the other gives an increasingly one-sided image of the EU in the Middle-Eastern conflict, undermining its credibility.

 The conflict between Israel and Hamas and other terrorist factions operating in Gaza is asymmetric. On the one hand there is a state that has the right and the duty, like any other state, to protect its citizens from the over 5 000 missiles and rockets launched since 2005, and on the other a terrorist organisation the aim of which is the destruction of the State of Israel, deliberately targeting civilians in order to terrorise the population. The situation is even more worrying if we consider the military and financial support provided by Iran to Hamas and the ambiguous role played by the new Egypt, in which the Muslim Brotherhood is increasingly influential. To forget these facts and turn the victim into the aggressor is not only to encourage extremism but also to allow extremists to voice the claims of the Palestinian people.

 I support Mr Bové’s report on promoting the tastes of Europe. Farmers, and especially small-scale farmers, increasingly need aid and legal instruments to cope with global competition in agricultural markets both within the EU and internationally. I think the policy to promote local markets through the development of products with low food miles and information about origin and quality is particularly important for guaranteeing better incomes for farmers. This approach could prove particularly important in mountainous areas where in-quota agriculture is one of the most important ways of preventing the abandonment and degradation of the land and the environment.

 I agree with Ms Costa’s motion on protecting children in the digital world. It has been calculated that children spend up to 40 hours a week in front of the television and are online for 88 minutes a day.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ‘obscenity’ is the Taliban’s accusation against the 14-year-old Malala, who asked to go to school and for the right to education for girls in Pakistan, and the accusation of obscenity is the excuse to strike Malala down with two shots from a firearm, one to the head and the other to the shoulder. The Taliban’s attack not only has religious or political motivations, but aims to suppress and wipe out fundamental human rights and deny women dignity and the right to education. Such is the culture and lifestyle model the Taliban propose to the Muslim world, with utter contempt for their own lives and the lives of others. We obviously condemn these cowardly and cruel acts, but we would like ‘moderate’ Islam as a whole to raise its voice with us, to condemn these criminals.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again when we discuss relations between the EU and Israel, this House has divided along ideological lines and dragged a technical agreement into the area of political opposition, ignoring its content. The agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) is not an upgrading of relations between the EU and Israel; this is not an international legal measure defining frontiers and establishing rights of sovereignty. The legal services of Parliament and the Commission have approved it, underlining that the ACAA with Israel does not go beyond the existing legal framework. This is a technical agreement that will allow many European citizens easier access to quality medicinal products at a lower price, with considerable savings for our national health services. Italy will save about EUR 1 billion annually, a considerable sum in these difficult economic times. I therefore think that this agreement should be supported. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Under the Geneva agreement, Russia too has accepted the need for a compromise based on a transition process agreed by the government and by the rebels, whereby the opposition and Mr Assad’s regime would have to share power. At this point it is important to ensure opposition unity on a shared political platform, at least on some key points. We must avoid the Balkanisation of the conflict and its degeneration into combat between ethnic or religious groups. The future must bring a secular, democratic and tolerant Syrian society. Unfortunately, however, there has been recent news of attacks on the Christian community, which fuels fears of possible persecution by a new theocratic and Islamic fundamentalist regime in Syria. Europe must do everything it can to ensure that what happens in Egypt with the Coptic Christian community or in Libya between the various clans also happens in Syria. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have said, this is a protocol of a technical nature relating to the production of pharmaceutical products, and has already been negotiated by the Commission and approved by the Council in 2010. It cannot be considered as an upgrade of relations with Israel, as Baroness Ashton declared here in Parliament. The Commission has also stated that no changes are needed to this agreement and, moreover, the high quality of the medicinal products involved and the economic benefits for national health care systems have been confirmed. The Italian health care system, for example, would save millions of euro in patient care costs. My conviction is that in fact, opposition to this agreement is of a purely political nature, with the aim of boycotting Israel. Those who oppose this agreement for political reasons should therefore also oppose trade agreements with China, which is occupying Tibet, with Russia, occupying part of Georgia, Armenia, occupying Nagorno-Karabakh, and with any states guilty of serious human rights violations, which amounts to two-thirds of humanity.

 The appointment of a European Representative for Human Rights is intended to increase the visibility of European policy in this area. Greater visibility also means greater accountability and the need to report regularly to Parliament on this especially sensitive subject. I support this initiative. Appointing a Special Representative for Human Rights will enable the EU human rights strategy and the associated action plan to be implemented more effectively, by formulating recommendations, by stepping up dialogue with third countries, international, regional and non-governmental organisations active in this sector, by fostering overall coherence in EU action on human rights, and by integrating this dimension across all areas of the Union’s external action.

 Many people would like to see a new role for European policy in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We all want Europe to promote more effective peace initiatives than have happened so far and to take on a political role more in tune with our financial commitments in the area. To achieve that in such a complicated and difficult situation, the European Union must be seen as credible and unbiased by both parties. Both the Palestinians and the Israelis must be convinced that the Union is only interested in peace and is not prejudiced against either side. Do we really think that the European Union can be regarded as a credible partner by Israel in light of the recent consensual positions reached by the Foreign Affairs Council last May, which totally ignored Israel’s legitimate security demands, surrounded as it is by hostile countries? At a time when the hopes raised by the Arab Spring are being dashed and we see Islamic extremism prevailing in the Maghreb countries, what security assurances can be given by the new Palestinian state if it comes into being, which, by the way, is what we all hope will happen?

Mr President, I will not repeat what has already been said on the territorial dispute and on the energy issue at the root of the conflict. The result is that an agreed separation between the two States, recognised by the international community, is degenerating into a large-scale armed conflict. Another tragic result is that in the Blue Nile region, controlled by the Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement, Sudan is blocking humanitarian aid destined for 200 000 people. As well as providing humanitarian aid, I would like to see Europe conducting a policy that is more committed to supporting the African Union, and not so much in opposition to the Chinese presence or influence in the area, but in order to strengthen pan-African politics and ensure that Africa belongs, a little more, to Africans.

 I would like to thank Ms de Sarnez for her in-depth and meticulous analysis of trade relations between the European Union and China. The results of indiscriminately opening the European market to Chinese goods are there for all to see: relocations and massive job losses in Europe; average annual Chinese growth of 9% while European countries suffer a serious recession; the impotence of European trade policy; and not forgetting that 83% of counterfeit goods seized at the EU’s external borders come from China.

 The economic crisis currently affecting Europe is so serious that it is necessary to take more decisive action to protect our industry and our small and medium-sized enterprises, especially when they are subject to dumping or other unfair conduct by operators in countries where there is no rule of law and the safeguarding of social and environmental rights is effectively non-existent. The fact that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has decided to accept a claim from China against the already rather unambitious anti-dumping regulation in force in Europe is, instead, a step in the other direction, which makes it harder to safeguard our businesses and our jobs. Therefore, I cannot agree with the content of this regulation, which could further compound the difficulties of our businesses. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 The Commission should not underestimate the importance of ‘regional airports’, which are distinct from ‘hub airports’ in that their function is mainly tied to the area in which they are located. Unfortunately, these airports are increasingly neglected by EU legislation and have been given secondary importance in recent proposals on the development of the EU transport network. I share Mr Bradbourn’s stance on the monopolisation of many regional airports by individual airlines and their isolation by the transport network. We need to block unfair practices, such as the ‘one bag’ rule imposed by airlines, which cuts passenger spending in airports by up to 70%, with repercussions on the local economies linked to regional airports.

 Mr Rinaldi’s report is very ambitious and gives us a chance to reflect on the effects – and also the causes – of the so-called ‘Arab Spring’. In contrast to the rapporteur, however, I think the view that has been set out is too optimistic and that many of the proposed measures are more pertinent to development cooperation than to international trade. The growing instability and increasingly extremist political trends which are increasingly being seen in countries such as Egypt and Libya prevent me from sharing in the overall feeling of confidence over the so-called ‘Arab Spring’ and the rather premature comparison, in my view, with the fall of the Berlin Wall. The ‘more for more’ principle should be at the heart of EU policy on Mediterranean countries and any increase in European contributions ought to be dependent on real reforms designed to bring about thoroughgoing democracy in these countries. Only then will we be able to discuss a possible review of tariff barriers. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, freedom of worship seems increasingly in danger and, in particular, cases of discrimination and persecution against Christians are becoming increasingly widespread in the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, recently in Nigeria, in South-East Asia, China, India, Pakistan and North Korea. In these countries, there are numerous cases of forced emigration, attacks and arson against places of worship and religious structures, torture and killings, kidnappings and forced conversions. Not less than 10% of Christians around the world, in other words, 200 million people, are minorities in their own countries and potential victims of discrimination. Religious freedom is a fundamental human right, as we all know, but both the European Union and international human rights organisations are, unfortunately, still not very effective at reporting violations and protecting this right. I therefore wish to reiterate the proposal already advanced on other occasions, to set up a specific, accurate, and annual report by the European Parliament to monitor the status of religious freedom in the world and strongly denounce violations where they exist.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what I hope we can do is draw up a thorough report on any violation of freedom of worship, wherever it occurs, and whatever religion is prevented from being upheld, practised or pursued by anyone in the world. Not a discriminatory report against any one religion, but a report that starts from acknowledging the growing number of attacks on Christians around the world, which are becoming more severe and more numerous, as I have already said. I believe, given that this Parliament regards the protection of human rights and of all human rights as fundamental, that the protection of religious rights is perhaps the most fundamental, since they are based not only on human needs but on morals, and therefore we must be united in defending them, and in doing so, we are consistent with the objectives of this Parliament and are consistent with the defence of human rights, which has repeatedly been hailed around the world as a victory for civilisation. I am sure you will be on my side, as I am on yours. Fiorello Provera,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Kosovo is a country with enormous structural problems, as highlighted by the report itself. Chronic and widespread corruption, a judicial system that does not respond to the needs of a democratic country, a highly inefficient public administration, a serious lack of media freedom, insufficient protection of minorities even as regards cultural and religious traditions. Furthermore, the economy is very weak and environmental protection is neglected. On top of all this, crime syndicates are widespread, trafficking arms, people and drugs, as verified by international investigations and reported by authoritative media organisations. In 2010, the Council of Europe also denounced the involvement of Prime Minister Thaçi in organ smuggling and other criminal activities. All of this shows that we are a long way from any suggestion of possible integration, even though we have a duty to accompany Kosovo in its social and democratic development.

 I know that the Council of Europe accusation mentions President Thaçi by name 27 times, and that this news was also reported by the BBC.

 I am against the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia joining the European Union in the immediate future. I agree with the rapporteur’s view that there has been some progress – in fact, important progress; you just have to look at the latest elections, the economic reforms and at the end of the Parliamentary boycott. However, I am puzzled at the idea of accession, because there is still too great a distance between the social and political institutions of this Balkan state and those of the EU Member States. The rushed accession of a country in which there is separation and mistrust between ethnic groups could create a breeding ground for tensions within the EU and slow down the process by which the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia moves towards becoming a pluralist society.

 I voted against this resolution, even if I agree with some of the conclusions contained in Ms Pack’s report. I am not convinced by the underlying theory, the concept that, despite the critical areas, the EU accession process of Bosnia and Herzegovina should take place without pause for thought. There are still too many question marks about the real authority of the Balkan state. There are too many concerns about the effective independence of the judicial system, which is an indispensable requirement for guaranteeing the rule of law. Finally, too many criticisms can be levelled at the country with regard to its economy. In order for the European Union to be a driver of growth and political stability, it is fundamental that there should be a certain level of convergence between Member States, and Bosnia and Herzegovina does not currently have this.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have seen, the persecutions and killings of Christians are continuing on a wide scale in Nigeria. The latest official data says that the Boko Haram armed group, which wants to convert the country to Islam, has killed 1 200 Christians in the last two years and forced 35 000 Christians to flee the country. However, in some Arab countries, too, like Egypt and Iraq, millions of Christians are discriminated against, even killed or forced into exile. There is a sort of growing religious racism against Christians that is being accepted almost with resignation or fatalism. In this situation, the international institutions, including Europe, and important political and religious figures must make their voices heard loud and strong and call upon governments to face their responsibilities. I should add that I would also like to see the so-called moderate Islamic citizens, who quite rightly reject extremism, join us in defending the rights of their Christian fellow citizens. To return to Nigeria, we have mentioned the widespread poverty, the high levels of poverty of so many millions of people in this extraordinarily rich country that could so easily provide amply for all its citizens. As Ms Sargentini says, there is a problem and that is corruption, which is so widespread and pervasive that it has altered the social structures of the country. With corruption, there is no respect for the environment, no free market, no opportunities for trade or young people, and therefore, ultimately, there is no democracy either. In actual fact, Nigeria needs a proper, qualified, extremely honest ruling class, and without this, it cannot really be considered a modern country or a democratic country. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I am in favour of many of the ideas proposed by Mr Saryusz-Wolski on the issue of relations with the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa): the idea that the EU should have its own global, comprehensive approach on the issue; the idea that the growing role of emerging countries, in particular, the BRICS, should be fully acknowledged within the framework of rules and values, above all, those enshrined in the United Nations Charter; the idea that parliamentary diplomacy can contribute decisively to the development of amicable relations, especially in those countries in which parliamentarianism is becoming established; lastly, the idea that developing full political relations with the emerging world must not disregard crucial issues such as the environment, human rights and labour conditions. By contrast, I have great doubts about the request for visa liberalisation with Brazil. Migratory dynamics are too complicated to be addressed by immediately opening up our borders, particularly at a time of economic crisis such as we are currently experiencing. It is for this reason that I decided to abstain from the vote on this report. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I agree with and support the conclusions in Mr Watson’s report. The EU is now the world’s biggest market and the largest donor of development aid. It represents a unique opportunity for promoting human rights and respect for the rules of peaceful coexistence of the community of Member States. Unfortunately, thus far, the cumbersome red tape surrounding the EU’s restrictive measures against regimes that do not respect international law, and the failure of such measures to feed into one another, have meant that they have not always had the desired effect as deterrents and sanctions. It is unjust that sometimes, peoples that are already oppressed or European companies and citizens should have suffered the consequences of sanctions, while the corrupt, violent local elites have managed to evade them. In the same way, it is equally unjust that third countries take and have taken advantage of European respect for the rule of law and fundamental rights. I therefore join Mr Watson in calling for the Council to adopt, as soon as possible, clear rules – to be applied uniformly and subject to periodic review – that will enable the restrictive measures to be more effective.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, the Arab Spring has led not only to political changes but also to new challenges and threats to stability. One of these is the growing phenomenon of arms smuggling. Since the fall of Gaddafi in Libya, the Egyptian authorities have been reporting a sharp increase in arms smuggling in the Sinai Peninsula. Surface-to-air missiles, rockets and anti-aircraft guns have been stolen from army barracks abandoned by Libyan forces and now supply a black market for weapons, destined for the Gaza Strip and Hamas in particular. This is a very worrying phenomenon because these arms are capable of shooting down civilian aircraft during take-off and landing and may end up in the hands of terrorist groups such as Al-Qaida, for example in the Maghreb. How, I ask, can we help to mitigate this growing threat and who are our potential allies? Fiorello Provera

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, it is difficult to be optimistic. If Tehran were to have nuclear weapons, it would seriously destabilise the area between the Mediterranean and the Caucasus and could trigger a nuclear arms race in neighbouring countries that for various reasons are afraid of Tehran, such as Saudi Arabia or Turkey. The latest Iranian Shahab-3 missiles can reach EU Member States such as Greece, Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria, and would make the Tehran regime’s threat to destroy the State of Israel possible. A nuclear Iran really could block the Strait of Hormuz, making any political or military countermeasures extremely risky. We cannot afford a new North Korea in the Middle East. The new sanctions imposed by Europe are certainly a positive step, but time is running out to find a diplomatic solution to this crisis and avoid the military option. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 The agreement signed with Georgia is an important step for the recognition of the quality of our products abroad. It is tangible proof of the fact that partnership agreements can be the driving force behind the protection of geographical indications. For these reasons, I share in the Committee on International Trade’s unanimous approval of Mr Moreira’s report. If the Commission could manage to strike more agreements like this one – perhaps with countries whose brand culture is not yet like our own – that would be of huge benefit to foreign consumers and European producers.

I agree with, and strongly support, the conclusions of Mr Patriciello on the European space strategy, in their expression both of appreciation and of concern. There is no doubt that space policy is a great opportunity for Europe because it stimulates technological innovation, because it helps to make European citizens more secure, because it creates synergies in a strategic civil and military sector, and, finally, because it creates jobs for highly qualified workers. It is therefore right that the project should play a key role in the Europe 2020 strategy. That said, it is all too plain that in terms of governance, the Commission could and should have drawn up a more ambitious plan. The failure to include it in the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020 risks undermining the investments made so far. The references to cooperation with the United States, Russia and emerging powers are too weak to frame the space policy in an international context. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I support the balanced report by Mr Cutaş. Strengthening relations between Europe and Uzbekistan is a pivotal element of our partnership with the countries of Central Asia. Furthermore, the European textiles industry, which has considerable expertise in processing raw materials, can only benefit from free trade with the world’s third biggest cotton exporter and fifth-largest producer of cotton. However, especially in the textiles industry, closer cooperation must not fail to take into account respect for human rights and for children. As the EU Presidency acknowledged in June, during the cotton harvest the Uzbekistan government uses between 200 000 and 2 million children as a source of labour, closing the schools and dismissing teachers who refuse to send their pupils to work in the plantations. This fact is a serious cause for concern. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

) With the end of the Cold War Central Asia became increasingly important on the international stage, and its importance is destined to become even greater if, as seems probable, relations between East and West continue to intensify in the next few decades. The success of our strategy therefore has a key role in maintaining stable and fruitful relations with countries in Central Asia. Unfortunately, the conclusions of the report by Ms Kiil-Nielsen appear to suggest that Europe is not moving in the right direction. Progress has certainly been made, but not enough for those who wish to establish a long-lasting partnership: we provide limited economic support to these countries; corruption is rife in their political regimes; and there is insufficient respect for fundamental rights, with systematic cases of torture, repression of political opposition and child labour. Finally, as the report points out, dangerous movements with links to Islamic fundamentalism are spreading in the area. For these reasons I voted against the report. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I am opposed to the conclusion of the agreement with Morocco as it will be beneficial neither for Moroccan fishermen nor for European taxpayers. It will not benefit Moroccan fishermen because it will not create new jobs and it will increase the imbalance that already exists between the local fleet and the fishery potential. It will not benefit European taxpayers because they will spend EUR 13.5 million on subsidising the Moroccan fisheries policy without a guarantee that the money will be used in a worthwhile manner. Furthermore, for every euro invested European taxpayers will only gain back EUR 0.65, which is less than half of the average amount generated by similar agreements. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I fully support the conclusions contained in Mr Lisek’s report. The defence sector is undoubtedly one of those most severely affected by the austerity policies implemented as a result of the economic crisis. At this rate, Europe risks being unable to shoulder its international responsibilities and seeing some of its traditional areas of strategic weakness, such as duplication of military capabilities and its inability to carry out operations without US support, intensify. In order to prevent such a scenario from occurring, and to avoid draining funds from other important expenditure headings, the only effective solution, as the report indicates, is to move towards greater cooperation within the Union, with due respect for national prerogatives. This cooperation should cover all areas of defence but, in particular, contract liberalisation, technological research, coordination of planning and sharing of certain capabilities. Greater collaboration would, moreover, enable European countries to strengthen their own strategic autonomy and increase their political influence within the Atlantic Alliance. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

There are many points with which I agree in the report tabled by Mr Siwiec and Mr David: from its emphasis on trade, to the importance it attributes to cultural ties between the younger generations in neighbouring countries and Europe; however, I do not feel I can support it. I do not agree with some of the few conclusions on immigration. The proposal to undertake a rapid liberalisation of the visa regime, for example, seems to be a proposal that will cause hardship both to the indigenous populations and to the migrants, at least until the economic and social systems of Europe and neighbouring countries resemble each other. The same holds true for the idea of separating the issues of immigration and security, a key connection helping to prevent social tensions in poverty-stricken areas. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, throughout the world, obstacles, including legislative obstacles, are increasing against freedom of worship. The number of attacks and murders grow each year and affect practitioners of all religions, but Christians in particular. Paradoxically, religious freedom is becoming an increasingly uncertain issue rather than one of the most natural and indisputable freedoms. In Europe and in our Parliament, we constantly proclaim our defence of human rights, but our work to guarantee religious freedoms is still rather ineffective. That is why I am in favour of the proposal, which has been put forward on other occasions, to commission a specific, accurate and yearly report by Parliament to monitor the state of religious freedoms around the world. This report would provide the necessary facts to plan appropriate and preventive political action in line with what was expressed by the High Representative to organise policies which are country-specific in terms of the needs of the country itself.

 Iran continues to claim that it wants to develop a nuclear programme for civilian purposes. In fact, however, it has carried out research and set up facilities for military purposes, as verified in recent inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Its nuclear ambitions, which in themselves are worrying, are accompanied by a policy of internal repression and aggression towards other countries in the area, such as Saudi Arabia and particularly Israel. This threat has not only political and military repercussions but also economic and strategic ones, because it may affect oil production and thus have economic and financial consequences that would have a direct impact on us as well. A global threat needs a global response. It is therefore crucial to establish very close cooperation with the United States regarding all measures that may from time to time become necessary, such as imposing further, more incisive sanctions on Tehran. I hope it is not already too late. Fiorello Provera,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will talk about the area I know best, northern Italy. The most important issue for our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) at the moment is access to credit; it is far more important than excessive red tape, the tax burden or international competition, particularly from China. The banks are being forced to recapitalise and get rid of the debts caused by their financial speculation, and so they are not granting any more credit to SMEs, which are too small to have their own capital resources or to provide guarantees. Small businesses are therefore unable to contribute to the country’s economic recovery, even if they are willing to do so. It is therefore essential to expand credit schemes of various kinds in favour of SMEs and to improve information about the availability of the financial instruments at their disposal, the Structural Funds in particular. Without money, there is no research, no equipment renewal and no possibility of investing, and therefore it is impossible to contribute to the country’s wellbeing. Fiorello Provera,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the massacre in Egypt to prevent a demonstration to protest against the burning of a Coptic church by Salafi Muslims shows how far it still is from democracy. Quite apart from the difficulties faced by the Copts when they request authorisation to build a church, according to a law dating back to the Ottoman Empire, there are an increasing number of attacks on Christians by Muslim extremists. The protests, instead of being guaranteed by the military authorities in power in Egypt, are being repressed with bloodshed. Paradoxically, these religious conflicts and these repressions were less frequent at the time of President Mubarak. But there are other worrying signs which are disappointing for the expectations of the so-called Arab Spring. I am referring to the attack on the Israeli embassy and the subsequent withdrawal of the ambassador, the attacks on the gas pipelines in the Sinai, the requests by some political parties to revise the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel and, finally, the huge advances being made by Islamist parties. Since the EU has rightly strengthened its political and financial support for Egypt, would it not be appropriate to apply the Füle-Ashton doctrine of ‘more for more’, and therefore also of ‘less for less’, by directing aid to those political, social and trade union organisations that promote democracy and stability in Egypt?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Eastern partnership is an important political dimension for the European Union, but the obstacles to its future development are currently rather concerning. Dialogue with Belarus remains difficult, while in Ukraine, the Tymoshenko case confirms a relapse on respect for human rights as well as rampant corruption. Parts of Georgia and Azerbaijan are under military occupation and the tension between Azerbaijan and Armenia is increasing, with a risk of ensuing armed conflict. Without losing hope on the future of the Eastern partnership, we must remind these six partner countries of their responsibilities: respect for the fundamental rules of democracy and the resolution of territorial conflicts. Here, I am referring in particular to Nagorno-Karabakh and to Georgia. Europe cannot accept violations of international law guaranteeing territorial integrity as, moreover, this House has already appealed for in its resolution on the South Caucasus, and we cannot repudiate our basic principles on respect for human rights.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in a statement on 5 October Commissioners Füle and Malmström expressed their satisfaction with the outcome of discussions with Tripoli on a cooperation agenda which included the management of migration flows, border management, pan-African policy and international protection for refugees and asylum seekers. This ambitious agenda came to an end for the reasons we know – NATO’s military intervention and the change of regime in Tripoli. I believe that the first objective is to resume cooperation with Libya as soon as possible on these major issues – border management, migration flows, energy supplies and the fight against terrorism. That said, another equally important issue is to support Libya’s new leadership in organising free elections as the first step in a long process that will, I hope, one day make it possible to build a truly democratic and stable country. Building a democracy is much more difficult than winning a war, especially if there is no previous memory of democracy in the country. I wanted to know what practical plans can be put in place in the short term to take action within civil society, especially in culture and education, which are key elements for building a true democracy in people’s hearts and minds.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is convinced that it is both opportune and necessary to create two states which can live together and in peace. The difference of opinion merely lies in understanding how to achieve these goals. The Palestinian Authority’s intention of unilaterally applying to the United Nations for recognition as a state is an initiative which, in my opinion, could harm the peace process and spark off chain reactions in the Middle East. There is clearly an intention to isolate Israel in a diplomatic sense and to present it with a fait accompli
, right at a time when the peace agreements with Egypt are threatened by extremist positions and relations with Turkey are in crisis. The episode of the attack on the Israeli embassy in Cairo is the latest link in this chain. The unilateral initiative by the Palestinians is in conflict with the principle shared by both parties, according to which the only solution to the conflict is bilateral negotiations between the parties. Unilateral recognition could therefore create further instability and make it even more difficult to build a democratic Palestinian state that could live in peace with Israel. I therefore hope that there will be a return to the key principles of the Oslo Accords, based on mutual recognition, peaceful coexistence, security and political rights. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 I would like to thank Mrs De Keyser for having wished to develop some points from the report on migration flows arising from instability, which was recently adopted by the European Parliament. In particular, the report insists on the importance of a global, coherent approach based on targeted strategies relating to development, human rights, good governance, social inclusion and promotion of women’s and minority rights in order to promote democracy.

The development of broadband can, in fact, be useful for economic recovery, for the support that it guarantees to innovation and the possibility of making transactions faster and simpler. The implementation of high-speed broadband networks in Europe is extremely important for the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.

 Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the Nagorno-Karabakh issue is little known and often by means of biased information, but a clear point, which is indisputable and, I would say, fundamental, is the principle of territorial integrity of a sovereign state. The inviolability of borders must be respected: this is the case in Georgia, Moldova, Cyprus and so in Azerbaijan. There have been numerous positions adopted on the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and the following have been pointed out: the 2008 Helsinki declaration, four United Nations Security Council resolutions and even our Parliament has given its views on this issue. The territorial integrity of a sovereign state is guaranteed by international law and questioning this principle means encouraging future military attacks and attempts to change the international status quo, with destabilising consequences for the whole world. Europe has a particular interest in resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh issue because Armenia and Azerbaijan fall within the scope of the Eastern Partnership project which expressly provides for stability and collaboration between partner countries. We should therefore work towards this. Lastly, I would point out that time consolidates Armenia’s position in the occupied territories and this makes an agreement more difficult and the situation in the area riskier.

 Without a legally binding global international agreement under which the other industrialised nations undertake to make equivalent commitments and emerging countries undertake to make suitable efforts, there are not sufficient grounds for a unilateral increase in the EU emissions reduction target for 2020. It is too early to recognise the Commission’s evaluation of a possible 25% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels, should the EU objective of increasing energy efficiency be met (20% increase by 2020). Before proceeding along these lines a careful examination is required, along with a thorough investigation of the implications in terms of costs. Within the framework of international climate negotiations, recognition of this result at this stage does not seem appropriate, because in the eyes of the other parties it detracts from the unilateral commitment already made by the European Union (-20% by 2020). It is also too early to recognise the milestones identified on the roadmap, before carrying out the necessary investigations for evaluating the implications for Member States. In view of these considerations, I voted against the report. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Europe is characterised by great territorial diversity and polycentric development.

This new approach will also be relevant to mountain regions which could similarly play a leading role in realising the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.

 Economic, social and territorial cohesion are fundamental principles in determining all EU policies and activities.

Innovation means creating synergies and an integrated approach between the different sectoral policies in order to achieve the optimal result for growth and development on the ground. I particularly agree with the rapporteur’s assertion that synergies and coordination do not imply one-size-fits-all solutions, but call for close strategic coordination between instruments, policies and actors in order to produce carefully designed interventions and programmes which take into account the territorial specificities and comparative advantages or special features of each region in an integrated place-based approach.

 In a large internal market like Europe’s, there is a need to ensure that consumers’ rights are protected. Mr Schwab’s report has the aim of merging four different directives: those on off-premises sales, on distance sales, on guarantees and on unfair contract terms. It is difficult to reconcile 27 different legal traditions on these subjects. This is probably not the most appropriate point in history to issue regulations of this complexity. It would have been more opportune, in my view, to concentrate on specific aspects and sectors, rather than to try and create a new competency shared between the EU and the Member States. In fact, for certain states, this directive will represent an over-large and over-enthusiastic step forward, while other countries will have to make concessions in the name of European harmonisation.

 This directive is designed to ensure that Member States establish a national regulatory and organisational framework and draw up appropriate national programmes for spent fuel and radioactive waste management, regardless of the perspectives of nuclear power and non-power applications. The Commission’s position is commendable: it makes the Member States responsible for the safe management, including disposal, of the spent fuel and radioactive waste that they generate, through the development of their own programmes. On the other hand, many of the amendments incorporated in the text are questionable. On such a sensitive issue as this, maximum transparency and public information are crucial. However, choices of this kind cannot be restricted to public participation in decision-making alone. In fact, the danger of not laying down precise rules is that we will fail to take the decisions necessary to ensure the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have seen that no country can face the problem of immigration alone. It is essential to have a policy governing large migration movements that supports development cooperation and provides for multilateral and bilateral agreements with the migrants’ countries of origin and of transit. Unfortunately, the new European external action instruments have not been used in the spirit or with the vision of the Treaties, as Italy is now finding. The front-line Member States have in fact had to face the refugee crisis by means of unilateral initiatives, without being able to rely on European solidarity. I therefore call on the Commission to define the cases in which we can talk of a ‘mass influx of displaced persons’ under the terms of Directive 2001/55/EC on temporary protection, thereby setting precise, measurable criteria that can be regarded as permanent. Such clarification is important for promoting an effective common policy on migration and ensuring that the burden is shared. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

The Balkan region is one of the most sensitive areas of the EU’s external borders in terms of illegal migration. This phenomenon is of great significance and has repercussions on the daily lives of many of our citizens, exacerbating the insecurity they face. Before being able to think about the possible admittance of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area, special and detailed plans must be drawn up to contain migratory pressures. In addition, improving controls at external borders must be combined with fighting the corruption of local authorities. I voted against this measure for the reasons stated and to better protect our citizens against illegal immigration. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Through this measure, we are at last able to express our desire to improve the work of rating agencies by enhancing their transparency, integrity, responsibility, independence and reliability. While recognising the role of agencies in supplying information and stimulating market liquidity, it is now quite clear that financial operators have placed too much faith in their judgments and that their actions contributed to causing the financial crisis. There is too much dependence on external credit rating agencies and an oligopoly exists in the sector. I am therefore in favour of establishing an independent European Credit Rating Foundation with responsibility for ratings in the public sector, for companies and for structured finance instruments.

European legislation is too often complex, difficult to understand and difficult to apply. This is why impact assessments can make a significant contribution to improving the quality of EU law making, particularly in terms of reducing the timescales and costs of the legislative process. I support this measure because, by taking the requirements of Member States into greater consideration, it will be possible to evaluate the possible social, environmental, financial and economic consequences of a legal act. Impact assessments should also be completely independent and transparent and be carried out in the early stages of the legislative process. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 The Galileo system will improve the accuracy and the reliability of US Global Positioning System (GPS) information. This new system will be important for ensuring Europe’s autonomy and independence from other global navigation systems and enabling it to claim a share of this booming worldwide high-tech market. As we know, the programme is funded fully by the Union budget with a budget of EUR 3.4 billion until 2014. We know that the indirect benefits of the programme are estimated to be around EUR 60 billion per year, but the Commission has admitted that additional investment will be required in order to reach full operational capacity. As it is not clear how much the Galileo system will cost the taxpayer, I abstained on this measure, not least to reiterate the request to the Commission to clarify the project’s future costs.

 Mr President, the dialogue between the European Union and Russia must be expanded as much as possible in various areas, from the economy to human rights, because there are no alternatives to dialogue. Europe and Russia are, in fact, interdependent, both economically and politically. I am thinking of unresolved international issues such as energy security, the Maghreb, Iran’s nuclear capability, terrorism, the Caucasus, Nagorno-Karabakh, climate change and others. Russia is a strategic partner for Europe, not least because of the synergies that may be built in future. As already happens to some extent, Moscow can supply us with mineral and energy resources as well as collaborate on military security and the fight against terrorism and organised crime Europe can contribute with financial resources, scientific and technological capabilities and our long-standing experience in the field of democracy and human rights. Russia’s future is linked to Europe’s and must be developed with perseverance, without complacency and despite the many difficulties that currently exist. In that respect, the conclusion of the strategic partnership agreement between the European Union and Russia is of great importance for our common future. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Croatia asked to join the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in 2005. Since this country is on one of the main drug smuggling routes into the European Union, I consider it important to have factual, objective information from Croatia on these problems.

Sudan, the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa, is a crossroads between the Arab and African worlds, as well as a mosaic of many heterogeneous ethnic groups. It has seen numerous conflicts since its independence from the United Kingdom in 1956. With the signing of the Naivasha Agreement and the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) (2005), 20 years of conflict between the north and south formally came to an end. In January 2011, as provided for in the CPA, a referendum marked the last leg of the road towards the independence of the south from northern Sudan. In this extremely delicate transition phase, we must keep a balanced approach to both north and south, with particular attention to the needs of the south regarding institution building and governance. The aid given by the EU to South Sudan must be measured in terms of the effective capability of this new state to absorb it. Indeed, we must ensure that future flows of funding to Juba do not end up being used inappropriately or, worse, adding to the already widespread corruption. Europe should also increase its commitment to protect the Christian minorities in the north of the country, who are increasingly the targets of persecution and discrimination. Fiorello Provera  (EFD

 Azerbaijan actively participates in the European Neighbourhood Policy, is one of the EU’s six Eastern partners, and is among the founders of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly. The core values of these three initiatives are respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law. These initiatives are intended to foster a continuous political dialogue that can deepen ties between member countries and enable Europe to accompany them along the path to reform. We believe that the instrument of the emergency resolution may be inadequate or even counterproductive to the achievement of the desired goal, namely, Azerbaijan steadily progressing towards its objectives of full and modern democracy. The institutions set up under the agreements reached at interparliamentary and intergovernmental level are intended to achieve these ends; these are the right place to demand explanations for possible infringements of rights and effectively encourage good behaviour and democratic reforms.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the attacks on Coptic churches in Egypt and the killing of Christians are signs that religious intolerance is worsening, betraying the spirit of unity shown in Tahrir Square, where Copts and Muslims demonstrated together against the regime. Coexistence and social stability are essential for an orderly transition to democracy, but they are made impossible by this lack of tolerance. The authorities in Cairo must therefore make a greater commitment to protect minorities and to oppose Salafi extremism, which is a negation of the principles of modern democracy to which the Egyptian people aspire. Economic development, with the resumption of foreign investment and, above all, tourism, is unthinkable without tolerance, order and stability. It is therefore in the interests of Egypt and the world that Europe should grant generous aid, but this aid must be conditional upon an effective policy to protect minorities, in line with the ‘more for more’ principle that you, Baroness Ashton, proposed together with Commissioner Füle.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to Bahrain. This little country lies in a strategic position in terms of the balance of the Gulf and energy supply distribution. The presence of a major oil refinery for Saudi crude is well known. I would like to draw your attention to one aspect of this situation which seems particularly worrying to me. Reliable sources have identified Iranian influence on the Shi’ite population of Bahrain. This is in addition to the legitimate aspirations for more substantial reforms in the government of that country. It is difficult to determine how much weight outside influence has had on the recent events in Bahrain, but there is a risk of destabilisation of the region that could extend to eastern regions of Saudi Arabia, home to another large group of Shi’ites. Iran funds Hamas, supports Hezbollah in Lebanon and influences the internal politics of Iraq, where Shi’ite Islam is the predominant component of the government. If the disruption of balance spread to the Gulf, the impact would be obvious and there could be global repercussions. We must be very careful in assessing what happens in the Middle East and distinguish the legitimate aspirations of peoples for greater democracy from external influences which have strategic ambitions in the area.

When we review the European Neighbourhood Policy, it is important to assess the impact of this policy on migration. No Neighbourhood Policy can be fully effective in this area without tackling the causes of instability that trigger migration. This entails regional cooperation, potentially via bilateral agreements, with both the countries of origin and with transit countries. We must cooperate with transit countries and with countries of origin for migration so as to prevent surges. We must help the migrants’ countries of origin to democratise and attain good governance by giving them access to our values and our experience. With regard to the European Neighbourhood Policy, we need an economic agenda which can increase levels of employment and trade agreements that can generate real, market-driven, economic development. Commissioner Füle and High Representative Ashton support, with the ‘more for more’ formula, the concept of conditions for aid which aim to reward the countries most active in terms of democratic reforms and respect for human rights. This approach should be encouraged, as it is consistent with our values, effective for development, and does right by European taxpayers. Fiorello Provera,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this tragically topical own-initiative report was first drawn up more than a year ago to assess the phenomenon of immigration and its structural causes in a pragmatic and balanced manner, regardless of political or ideological prejudices. We wanted to investigate the role of foreign policy and its ability to have an effect on the deep-seated causes of immigration, beyond humanitarian or emergency causes. Wars, ethnic tensions, persistent climate change, human rights violations, a lack of civil and economic liberties, endemic corruption, a lack of institutional representatives of citizens’ needs, such as trade unions, associations, political parties: the set of all these elements represents the field of deployment of European foreign policy and resolving these problems will remove many of the reasons that cause millions of people to emigrate. No development cooperation policy can be fully effective without tackling the causes of instability in migrants’ countries of origin. This involves regional cooperation with both with the country of origin and the country of transit, including through bilateral agreements. The Millennium Development Goals are already very ambitious, but certainly will not be achieved without political stability and without implementing effective mechanisms for preventing conflicts and maintaining peace. The global reach of this policy and its holistic approach require clear ideas and substantial financial resources that are difficult to come by in this moment of crisis. It is therefore advisable to coordinate the actions of the Union with those of other major powers such as the United States to avoid duplication of funding in the same areas or dispersal of financial resources, as has often happened in the past. A global phenomenon must be dealt with by a global policy. We must lead the migrants’ countries of origin to democracy and good governance by making available our values and our experience. Under the European Neighbourhood Policy, we should offer an economic agenda that can increase levels of employment and trade agreements that can generate real economic development consistent with market laws. Commissioner Füle and the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, drew attention, with the slogan ‘more for more’, to the concept of conditionality of aid which aims to reward countries that are most actively setting out on the road to democratic reforms and respect for human rights. This is consistent with our European values, effective for development and – if you will allow me – morally fair to taxpayers. I would like to conclude by stating that a European policy for the management of large migration flows should go hand in hand with acceptance of the concept of ‘burden sharing’, in line with the duty of State solidarity under Article 80 of the Treaty, because no country can face up to an emergency of enormous proportions by itself. Finally, I thank Commissioner Malmström for her support for some or many points in this report, and I hope that Europe can actually work with Italy to address a phenomenon that has an international dimension and that affects every one of us. Fiorello Provera,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, before I come to the report, I would like to respond to Mr Meyer and Mr Tavares. I really respect the opinions of everyone, but it seems to me that their views on Lampedusa and what is happening in Lampedusa are hardly generous. I wanted to inform them that 12 000 people arrived in Lampedusa within the space of three nights. Lampedusa is a small island with 6 000 inhabitants and 12 000 people arrived suddenly in three nights, increasing the population to 20 000. I think it is very difficult for any country to accept such a large number of people arriving in such a short space of time on a small island which has no facilities for such a great number of arrivals. There are currently 1 400 migrants on Lampedusa. Much has been done, and as soon as sea conditions permitted, the migrants were transferred to other centres, primarily in the south of the country. This brings us to the report. I wanted to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the different political parties who, with their different sensibilities, have contributed very effectively to this report. They made a fundamental contribution, in absolute transparency, in the same spirit that inspired us all at the beginning. I also thank Commissioner Malmström for the enthusiasm she has shown for the concept of burden sharing, which should influence her work within the Commission and thus within Council. If she continues to show the same enthusiasm, I think the results will follow. I end by saying that the situation is very difficult to sum up. Insofar as a summing up is possible, I would like to say that any policy will be ineffective and incomplete as long as huge differences persist between the levels of development in the North and South of the world, as long as huge differences persist in the quality of democratic institutions, and as long as there are vast differences in respect for human rights. We must take action as part of a major policy of strategic cooperation and aid that will have an impact on the structural causes that led to these huge inequalities between North and South. If we solve those structural causes, the rest will follow and the world we all live in will probably be a better place. Fiorello Provera,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I also wish to express my sympathy and admiration for the dignity, fortitude and cohesion demonstrated by the Japanese people in the face of the sort of catastrophe that the world has rarely seen in terms of size and severity. The behaviour of the Japanese people is truly an inspiration to all and they deserve our help. The lesson to be learned from this experience is the need to strengthen the European civil protection system through more closely coordinated action and the wider availability of people and resources so that we can act quickly in the event of disaster. With regard to the nuclear option, it would be a mistake to discuss this topic on the emotional tide of current events: the subject is too important and must be addressed with a scientific approach. It is absolutely right to strengthen security measures for present and next-generation power stations and to dismantle those that are older and more unsafe, but we must avoid political exploitation and be cautious and pragmatic, as Mr Brok said. We should remember that in the same Fukushima area, a dam collapsed during the earthquake with many casualties, but this does not lead us to think of dismantling dams or building new ones, hence I call for caution, attention and openness to the future.

 Through this report, Parliament has highlighted important issues that deserve to be emphasised in terms of the growth of European industry. I am referring to the recognition of the strategic role of small and medium-sized enterprises and to the need to make it easier to access credit with simplified funding procedures, as well as the importance of internationalisation as a key factor for competitiveness. The link between innovation and the industrial world through continuous relations between enterprises and universities is also crucial and includes the sale of results and encouraging their use. For this reason, I support the contents and the proposals of the report by Mr Lange. Fiorello Provera,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Belder on his excellent work. Whilst the world is watching the revolt in the Arab world, Iran continues to repress dissidents. The arrest of the two leaders of the opposition, Mr Mousavi and Mr Karoubi, is the most obvious proof of this. The West took action against Mr Gaddafi, but it continues to dither over Iran, perhaps because Mr Gaddafi has already fallen whilst Mr Ahmadinejad so far has not. The largest rebellion since the post-electoral revolts of 2009 is currently under way in Iran. What are we waiting for before we freeze all the assets held by Mr Ahmadinejad, the companies controlled by the revolutionary guard and all supporters of the regime who are involved in this repression? What are we waiting for in order to impose travel restrictions on these figures of the regime? Fiorello Provera  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is the principal financial backer of the Palestinian Authority, providing it with around EUR 1 billion per year, and yet Europe’s political role in the peace process remains marginal. This large-scale financial assistance gives us the right to ask the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to return to the negotiating table. On the issue of the recognition of Palestine, we must be clear. The problem of peaceful coexistence with Israel will not be resolved through unilateral recognition of the Palestinian State, which, moreover, still has not been self-proclaimed. The PNA must instead go back to taking an active role, sit down at the negotiating table and resolve the ongoing disputes, particularly over safe borders, on the status of Jerusalem and on the issue of refugees. Even a partial agreement would strengthen the moderate sections of both sides and reduce the influence of extremism. Fiorello Provera,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fall of President Mubarak has paved the way for democracy, but it is also a tremendous opportunity to liberate the Egyptian people. The reform of the country’s democratic institutions will allow for, amongst other things, further development of the economy and the possibility of spreading prosperity to all members of society, even the weakest. Without democracy, economic development will serve only to enrich a few families, as has always been the way in countries that have no social justice. European policy must therefore support Egypt as it embarks on reforms and help the Egyptian people to choose their own future unaided. On the other hand, we must be clear with the future government of Cairo and emphasise that a new and more generous partnership policy will be conditional upon regional security and peace with Israel.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to provide an immediate political response to these emergencies. The urgent interventions requested by Italy are: 1) the transformation of Frontex from a coordination agency to an operative structure with its own people and resources; 2) the implementation of the principle of burden sharing; 3) the use of Europol for investigations on possible terrorist infiltrations and criminal organisation of the traffic in human beings; and 4) the allocation of resources to deal with the emergency. In any case, none of this will resolve the structural causes of the revolutions in the Maghreb, which all arise from the lack of genuine political parties, trade unions, associations, a free press and, above all, lack of respect for human rights. In essence, the institutional tools that characterise true democracy and give the people a voice are missing. Without them, there cannot be economic development, jobs, stability and security for all. This is the real political challenge that Europe must face up to. Fiorello Provera,  
on behalf of the EFD Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the old order is changing in the Maghreb and this crisis raises a multitude of problems that will not be easy to solve. There are risks as well as hopes. It is possible that secular authoritarian regimes could be replaced by aggressive, destabilising Islamic fundamentalist theocracies. We should remember what happened in Iran: it is hard for democratic development to go hand-in-hand with revolution. There are certainly lessons to be learnt from Iran. Another danger is that the economic crisis in the area is likely to worsen, resulting in even greater youth unemployment and large influxes of migrants that Europe can no longer cope with. These events are a sign that our Euro-Mediterranean policy is inadequate and show that the cooperation policy implemented so far is not up to the task of creating the conditions for development and democracy. What has happened is not due solely to the economic crisis, even though it has been severe, but to the lack of social stability, in other words the lack of vehicles to represent the people’s interests, such as trade unions, a free press, political pluralism, a voluntary sector, the rule of law and equal opportunities for everyone. Supporting the countries of this region in their journey should be at the heart of Europe’s policy, alongside economic and trade assistance. This is the way to create true stability: not the stability provided by authoritarian regimes, but stability founded on social consensus, participation and democratic institutions.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Cesare Battisti is not a romantic hero as some have depicted him, but a savage murderer with a history of robbery who has been found guilty of killing four people with shots to the back of the neck. He benefited unjustly from Mr Mitterrand’s doctrine of political asylum and has been protected and idealised by some left-wing French intellectuals. Having fled to Brazil to avoid repatriation and prison, Mr Battisti was saved by President Lula due to an erroneous decision that was probably made for political reasons, with no regard for the suffering of the victims and their relatives. Mrs Figueiredo, Parliament’s request to the Brazilian authorities and to the Commission does not only ask for the respect of legal rules and bilateral agreements, but also aims to affirm the principle that no ideological reason can justify the actions of a murderer and no country may guarantee him impunity. We must never forget that there is ethical value in the moral compensation of victims by serving a punishment. This is at the foundation of the social contract that props up all communities that are civilised, or that aim to be. Giancarlo Scottà,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must thank Ms García Pérez for her long and patient work over the last year to reach an agreement that is as close as possible to Parliament’s position. The course of events started back in 2009 with our own-initiative report on quality products, which highlighted certain important issues on which we have achieved results today and others on which we still have work to do. The outcome we have secured is a success for all those producers, associations and cooperatives that have supported us over these years, and acknowledges their commitment to quality. The importance of their work is highlighted in this report, since the Member States are enabled to promote the establishment and operation of such groups. The positive outcomes obtained are due to the teamwork shown by Parliament’s delegation to the meetings with the other institutions. They include ex officio
 protection, whereby the Member States must protect products with quality marks, even where they are used as ingredients in processed products, without waiting for producers to make a complaint. In contrast to the measures introduced in Mr Nicholson’s report on contractual relations in the milk and milk products sector, production management for quality marks in other sectors has been left out of the report now being debated. It was simply not possible to reach agreement on production planning, a crucial issue for our producers. They wanted this instrument above all to make it possible to balance demand and supply. We will continue working alongside our fellow Members to achieve this outcome as well. Lastly I would like to thank the Italian associations that represent the cooperatives, which have worked with us and will continue to do so. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a substitute member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and a full member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I have had the occasion to work on this dossier. I have the impression that, on this issue, the Commission is not taking the real protagonists of the event – the breeders and the producers – into consideration. The aim of the proposals is to introduce a ban on voluntary labelling – a measure that is precisely not obligatory – which allows producers who choose to do so to provide additional information on the label. Since the same organisations representing breeders and producers have asked for this measure to continue to be provided, it is paradoxical not to concede this possibility. On the contrary, within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, work is being carried out in order that our farmers can provide data relating to the products that they sell in as transparent a way as possible. It therefore seems counterproductive to work, on the one hand, to protect the provision of information to consumers and make it transparent while, on the other hand, abolishing measures, voluntary measures even, that go in the same direction. It is clear that these are choices to be made if the intention is to lower the quality and the standards of agricultural products. There is no other explanation of a comparable measure against breeders committed to providing indications of quality, such as the choice of one type of feed rather than another. For these reasons, I will be voting against certain amendments. Giancarlo Scottà,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard and as has been said, I am concerned about what is happening in Syria, where the conflict is continuing with increasing loss of human life. Neither of the two sides can win via the military approach and the only possible solution is a political one, supported by the government and the opposition. Europe must work to this end. The dangers to avoid are a takeover by Islamic extremism or the Balkanisation of the country along ethnic and religious lines. I hope that Europe adopts a serious and practical stance – which, as we have already heard, it is working on – and I therefore hope for an excellent outcome to put an end to these civilian and military deaths, and everything else.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we have adopted today proposes the creation of a single working and services area for the maritime, mountain and lake areas of the Mediterranean basin, with the participation of national governments and, above all, local and regional authorities. This project rekindles the political ideal of a Europe of the regions, in line with the founding fathers’ original vision for Europe. To highlight the importance of macro-regions, I would like to highlight and bring to your attention an initiative that came about, in part, as a result of the work and ideas of my party’s representatives. It is the agreement to create the macro-region of the Alps, signed in St Gallen, Switzerland, on 29 June by regions belonging to France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria and Germany. The leaders of the three northern Italian regions of Veneto, Lombardy and Piedmont took part in the meeting. I hope this initiative will soon come to fruition, not least in this Chamber, thereby helping Europe evolve towards a genuine Europe of the people and of the regions. That is the only way to overcome the current financial crisis, to add value to our regions and their special quality products, to revive the economy in real terms, and to fully implement the principle of subsidiarity. That is why I voted for Mr Alfonsi’s report. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with my colleague’s report on rural development where it introduces some appreciable elements of simplification such as the reduction in the number of annual progress and summary reports. Under the heading of rural development is the change to the rules on using advisory services, which should help to reduce the administrative burden for Member States. I also agree with Mr De Castro on the need not to exclude support for producer associations in the fruit and vegetable sector, as part of measures to support the establishment and administration of producer associations. I also consider it essential, as the rapporteur stated, that Member States which have opted for regional programmes be allowed calculation of the automatic decommitment of financial resources at Member State level. I also agree with the position of Mr Capoulas Santos in his report on the system of financing by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, and I thank the other Members that I have not mentioned for their work.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Ms Paulsen for her report. I find it very odd that in such a prestigious House, where important decisions will be taken, there are still those who, in an ambiguous, anachronistic spirit of animal welfare, waste precious time and cost all European citizens and taxpayers money, with no benefit to human welfare or health. Faced with a text that is potentially of great interest to animal lovers – I am one too – and that will naturally have positive consequences for animals themselves, people are seeking to table amendments that undermine all the premises of the text and the very meaning of our friends’ welfare, with abstract suggestions of no legal or ethical value. Therefore, I cannot help wondering whether we should be investing – maybe I should say ‘wasting’ – time and resources to deal with proposals devoid of any practical interest for Europeans. Consequently, I shall be voting for Ms Paulsen’s report. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the objectives of the programme for food distribution include reasonable prices, market stabilisation and support for deprived persons. The institutions and national authorities have confirmed the need for full support of the programme through the EU budget, rejecting proposals for cofinancing by the Member States. There has been discussion about food wastage. We recently approved the report by Mr Caronna, which included the problem of the meagre access of the poorest population groups to food. I think that the issues are closely linked: helping to reduce wastage also means helping the most deprived. There are many local initiatives to help people in financial difficulties. I would like to mention the example of food collections, which should play a more prominent part in the programme on which we have been asked to vote. People who wish to donate spontaneously but do not have channels to do so need to be organised and put online. I would like to take the opportunity to thank all those who work towards these goals in their everyday lives. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate my fellow Member on choosing the issues tackled. Why new skills? Changes in the labour market undoubtedly make it necessary to change and acquire new skills. However, what should we do with the skills that represent our heritage and our traditions? Ms Bastos highlights the need to maintain the craft tradition and its associated skills. However, we need to do more. What about the trades that were once pivotal to the economy in certain areas? These areas, for example, in the mountains and foothills, no longer exist, having been abandoned in favour of the cities. One solution which could help create jobs and therefore help with employment might be precisely to rehabilitate certain trades and traditions, which would also help disadvantaged areas. In order to ensure certain jobs continue, we need to invest in the young and give them a leading role in projects, traditions and trades that have fallen into disuse in the areas in question. Training aimed at finding young people jobs in small companies in these areas would have a two-fold benefit, helping to rehabilitate abandoned areas and increasing youth employment.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the key word in this report is ‘consumer’. We often forget who we are addressing when we take decisions. Important decisions have been taken in the report we are discussing, such as the indication of specific nutritional value or the indication of origin, in order to give consumers more correct information. It is a step forward, not the ultimate goal. Indication of origin for agricultural food products –
 the provenance of the main foodstuffs that make up a product –
 should be the first information available to the consumer. There are various cases in which traceability is vital, the latest being the bacteria which unfortunately killed several people. By identifying the provenance of a product it is possible to take swift action or to safeguard the product from incorrect information. The issue of competitiveness is no less important. Often an indication of origin can be a guarantee and a promise of quality. The various quality products of each country have won the trust of consumers. We support the indication of origin because consumers have the right to know what they are eating. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, of all Europe’s policies, the common agricultural policy is the one that has had to be updated the most over the years in order to cope with constant changes occurring on the economic front, including at international level. It has always been updated with two main goals in mind: guaranteeing an income for European farmers and dealing with an ever-decreasing EU budget, while not forgetting a whole host of other objectives linked to quality of production, of the environment, of biodiversity and of water resources. The CAP reform on which we will vote tomorrow is vital if we are to continue to support the income of our farmers, as my colleagues have already mentioned. The aim, then, is not to reduce direct subsidies but to find a balance between such subsidies and rural development, so that the system is rendered simpler and fairer, without the rules of competition being called into question. As regards the objectives of the CAP in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy, the CAP can contribute to the growth of a sustainable economy by responding well to new challenges and taking account of the diversity and richness of agriculture and the specific characteristics of the 27 Member States.

An awareness of the massive potential for improvement that new technologies can offer us, both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, necessarily involves abandoning the ways we worked in the past. New technologies mean new working methods. I myself have witnessed that by using technology intelligently in the monument protection sector, it is possible to obtain significant results, in terms of both the planning and restoration works. Additionally, as a simultaneous by-product, and without incurring additional costs, we can obtain highly accurate geometrical databases that can be used to monitor and manage the artefact in the event of natural disasters, as well as products for scientific education and for promoting the artefact on a global scale, fulfilling criteria for cultural understanding and exchange What I think matters most is that we contribute to a plan of action, whose aim is to help us reach a new awareness of technology, so that new economic opportunities may be created for Europe. I believe especially in the need to train new people and in professional, young and highly qualified individuals, who are able to rise to the challenges posed by the new global market.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, novel foods are food products or ingredients that undergo production processes and involve a change in nutritional value. I have a number of doubts about the new Novel Food Regulation. What relation will it bear to the regulation on genetically modified organisms (GMOs), since cloning is an aspect of genetic engineering and, as with GMOs, it involves actual genetic manipulation? How will the movement of these foods between European countries be regulated? How will the scientific tests needed to test the safety of these novel foods be carried out? What will the criteria be for defining these products and, most of all, how will consumers be informed of the characteristics and nutritional properties of the novel foods they purchase? My central concerns are consumer protection, food safety in the use of these novel products, and correct information. I therefore believe there must be total traceability for consumers, especially for natural products, for which we already find it difficult to guarantee traceability. Giancarlo Scottà,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased with this initiative, which aims to transform the European Heritage Label into a formal action of the European Union in order to increase its effectiveness, visibility, prestige and credibility. To this end, I should like to emphasise the importance of the professionalism of the members of the panel of experts appointed to evaluate the sites, as well as the rigorousness of the procedures for attribution of the label and reviewing its maintenance as time goes on. These elements are essential to ensure the specificity and quality of the label itself. The label must, however, focus entirely on symbolic and educational value, rather than on the beauty of the site – as other initiatives for the promotion of cultural heritage tend to – so as to clearly differentiate it from these. Therefore, I also agree that transnational sites should be held in particular consideration, in virtue of their symbolic importance. Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome Mrs Mănescu’s report. Multi-level governance has a key role to play in cohesion policy and, in this respect, the multi-level approach, which provides for cooperation and shared responsibilities across various levels of government, is being put into practice in the management of regional funds. The Commission is promoting initiatives in favour of regional and local authorities. There must be a greater incentive to support such proposals in order to ensure the real coordination and effective implementation of European programmes. The partnership must be guaranteed by a culture based on dialogue between the various parties involved. Cooperation at regional level must be transparent and must ensure fair representation of all concerned. For this reason, it is important to provide appropriate training for subnational representatives through initiatives such as Erasmus for regional and local officials, the financial cost of which must be borne by the Commission. This is likewise useful for exchanging good practices and for improving the quality and effectiveness of cohesion fund management. Giancarlo Scottà,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the third summit between the European Union and Africa is a fundamental opportunity to consolidate relations between the two parties. During this event we will talk about economic growth, sustainable development and political governance, considering several dossiers, including an examination of the agriculture and food safety sector in the context of the Millennium Development Goals. In order to guarantee universal access to food, combat poverty in rural areas and improve the quality of agricultural production, the participation of producers’ organisations and sector associations is required so that they can be committed and aware, and improve the distribution and management of natural resources. The European Union must work to make the best of these opportunities to intensify dialogue and cooperation in support of regional integration in Africa. In particular, the imbalances and corruption of cooperation initiatives must be fought. Governments’ responsibilities must not predominate over those of civil society and the participation of all those involved in strategies of sustainable economic and social growth must be guaranteed.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, cereal price volatility is having severe repercussions on all livestock sectors but also on consumers. Cereal exporting is blocked due to the effect of the heat, fires, drought and floods – as is happening now in Italy. To aggravate the situation, Canada has reduced production following heavy rainfall this summer. Prices have been influenced not only by climate change but also by speculation on international markets. Cereal producers who are awaiting a price increase wait before selling their produce and put it in store, with the result that these agricultural products deteriorate. Speculation and severe climate change have led to a great increase in the prices of cereals used as animal feed and a knock-on increase in meat prices. I believe it is essential for the Commission to ensure timely, targeted action to deal with the volatility in agricultural-product prices through innovative market interventions under the new CAP. The Commission must prevent speculative practices in agriculture to preserve the businesses of farmers and stock breeders and guarantee consumers genuine quality products at fair prices.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to a sector in which conditions for the female workforce continue to be precarious. I refer to the agricultural sector, a sector in which women focus on innovation and, at the same time, on revitalising traditions and preserving agricultural heritage, keeping rural territory alive. Yet female workers encounter a range of obstacles in their working activities, having to reconcile their working life with family life. Mrs Thomsen, in her report, provides a figure which gives us food for thought: in the agricultural sector, 86% of female workers are employed part-time. Furthermore, the entry of young women into this sector is fraught with difficulty and for this reason, women managing the farms are often over 65. On the other hand, some other women assume the position of supporting partner, or rather, they help with their husband’s farm, without being entitled to a legal status and without being appropriately remunerated. I would argue, therefore, that it is necessary to protect women and their employment in a sector in which their work is often temporary and seasonal, support them in the area of health and safety, and ensure they receive fair pay and appropriate recognition for their work.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, future regional and cohesion policy must be aligned with the Europe 2020 strategy priorities, and therefore it must be focused on the objectives of sustainable growth, social inclusion and employment. It needs to support the effective development of the European regions by levelling out the differences between them and enhancing the specific characteristics of the more marginalised areas which are still facing regional development challenges. The projects must take into account the less developed regions, which have been most severely affected by the crisis. New challenges such as population density in certain areas and depopulation in others, in mountain areas, in particular, along with climate change, must be addressed through concrete actions that strengthen local and regional involvement. The multi-level approach must stimulate the integrated development of disadvantaged areas by involving local and regional authorities as well as civil society. I urge the Commission to take into account the specific characteristics of each region, namely the regional dimensions of the various levels of development, and to simplify the management and control procedures for financed projects in order to ensure their effective and prompt execution.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon devotes particular attention to regions with severe and permanent handicaps. This is why I support Mr Provera’s initiative concerning the agricultural, environmental and cultural rehabilitation of these regions. I therefore call for the Commission to set to work as soon as possible on implementing a policy for mountain regions that will tackle the difficulties, declining population and abandonment of mountain regions, with the environmental degradation that that entails. It is crucial to provide for the agricultural activity, quality of life and cultural heritage of those living in disadvantaged conditions, and it is fundamental to ensure that the actions undertaken by the Commission, the Member States and regional and local authorities are in harmony with one another. A fundamental principle of the European Union is subsidiarity, an instrument that is crucial to promoting the development of disadvantaged regions through lasting and well-targeted measures resulting from regional proposals. This is a significant challenge, and the task will be to keep people in these regions, or, better still, to encourage them back there. Giancarlo Scottà,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is both important and necessary to achieve a balance between the need to advance scientific research and the need to protect animal welfare. Protection for animals used in scientific procedures is currently inadequate. New scientific knowledge means that alternatives can be promoted to replace or reduce the use of animals. Methods or procedures must be used that cause as little pain and suffering as possible, but without impeding scientific research designed to fight diseases. It is therefore right to review Europe’s animal protection legislation in order to achieve satisfactory results that both meet the demands of the research industry, given the need to pursue scientific research that benefits human health, and, at the same time, look after the welfare of those animals still needed for scientific purposes.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lyon, ladies and gentlemen, in a context such as this, farms need strong support in order to innovate and make progress. The role of farmers needs to undergo a radical change: by systemising agricultural production farmers become agricultural entrepreneurs, and thus promote economic development. I believe it is fundamentally important for the recovery of countless abandoned areas of land to be used in the creation of short, closed agricultural branches – in other words, systems that link agricultural cultivation directly to sales. These systems can operate and become widespread throughout the European Union. I believe that, under the new common agricultural policy (CAP), the Commission should support the creation of agricultural cooperatives so as to cut production costs and make farmers more competitive. The Commission must commit itself to defining a budget that is sufficient to achieve these objectives. The funding for the new CAP must be linked to results, so as to prevent waste and various kinds of speculation. What is more, at this time of crisis, many young people want to return to farming. However, they are faced with various obstacles: land is too expensive, and rural development policies are difficult to manage; the fact that there are long waiting times for land and that it is granted on the basis of earnings rather than on the basis of the ideas expressed by young entrepreneurs prevents this group from realising its potential. I believe that the Commission must take a supportive and flexible approach to helping young farmers. An information policy must also be launched, starting in schools and universities, in order to promote a … (The President cut off the speaker) Giancarlo Scottà  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Spanish Presidency has decided to sign this agreement. This decision has caused some concern, as we have already heard, and in tabling this question my fellow Members are asking for clarification as regards the impact that the negotiations may have on European producers and products. I wished to point out that the creation of a free-trade relationship between the two parties allows for imports into Europe of animal products containing antibiotic growth activators that have not undergone sufficient testing, and of genetically modified agricultural products that could jeopardise farmers’ food safety. I therefore call on the Commission to adopt an authoritative position so as to safeguard European quality production. The Commission must also undertake to ensure that Europe’s high production standards are recognised at international level and that these same standards are required of all imported products. Lastly, I believe that the Commission should take account of the concerns expressed by the various associations in the sector, so as to ensure transparent and fair negotiations that do not harm the European economy.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are being asked to vote on a draft report on information to consumers, but have we really asked ourselves what consumers want? Have these considerations been agreed on behind closed doors in Parliament, or do they reflect the interests of consumers? The latest survey announced by the Commission may not be representative of the increased awareness that consumers have developed in recent years with regard to information about their food choices. It is not only the origin but also the ingredients and other characteristics that are becoming a fundamental part of the decision-making process. Are we aware that the decisions we make today will influence tomorrow’s purchases? Should it not be consumers who determine the market? Why not try to understand, through a new survey or by maintaining ongoing direct dialogue with consumers, what it is that they really want? We must represent consumers as best we can. That is why we are here and, from the meetings I have had, I have discovered that consumers want to be involved more. They do not expect the buying process to be complicated by the inclusion of pointless information on labels, but nor do they expect overly simplistic, misleading choices such as the traffic light system, which risk providing irrelevant information that is not necessary for an informed choice and does not meet their needs. Our approach must not be paternalistic but open to dialogue. Giancarlo Scottà,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with market globalisation and the severe crisis now affecting Europe, including in the agricultural sector, one possible response on the part of the agricultural market is to place emphasis on product quality. I believe that a good EU quality policy can enhance competitiveness and create added value for Europe’s regional economies, since, for many rural areas where production alternatives are few, it is often the one and only opportunity for development. By supporting niche agriculture in these disadvantaged areas, we will create an economy and jobs there. Furthermore, a future quality policy must also be linked to the major potentialities of agriculture which, as in the European case, is modern, dynamic, rich and diversified and can offer not only high quality food products but also services of great value to a constantly evolving society. In my report, I emphasised the importance of keeping the three systems for registration of geographical indications separate, since they represent the link with European regions, representing their traditions, history, taste and unique knowledge handed down over time. I therefore believe that, by keeping the two PDO and PGI systems separate, they take account of the specific differences in the nature and strength of the links between the products and their geographical area of production. Consumers often confuse the geographical indication of where a food product was processed with the place of origin of the agricultural product as such, and are often not aware of how the food chain operates. I therefore consider that only the compulsory indication of the place of production of the primary products can provide consumers with full information on the quality of the products they are buying, since products are subject to a production cycle which exerts considerable influence on their characteristics in terms of quality and food safety. Let us remember that it is our duty to protect what our fellow citizens, who voted for us, produce and eat. Another two issues that I considered important to include in my report are as follows: the importance of an intensive campaign of consumer education and information, which the European Union should undertake concerning the various European labels and the guarantees they represent, and the inclusion in international registries and international recognition through the WTO system of geographical indications. This last point is vitally important if we want to protect against the counterfeiting of our high quality products. I would like to thank Commissioner Cioloş for his attendance and remind him of the importance of sufficiently protecting quality systems, which are our future, and remind him too that the economy of disadvantaged rural areas can be boosted by agricultural sector aid, to safeguard all those niche products that are typical of these areas and that keep the people connected to the locality, which would otherwise be abandoned. This would support respect for the environment and for the landscape and would create, where possible, a tourist and oenogastronomy economy linked to the various regional, cultural and historical differences in the European Union. I would like to thank my colleagues for the support they gave me in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and I hope that the European Parliament will also give its support during the vote tomorrow.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, Commissioner Cioloş. I should like to begin by talking very briefly about the land. The land is that from which we harvest our products and which we must preserve for the future and for those who will have to do the same. That is why, taking this simple thought as a starting point, I should like to move on to producers, to those who work the land, who must be recognised also by those who subsequently enjoy the commercial produce they find in the supermarket or some other shop. It is therefore only right that we respect first the land, which yields the produce, then the processor, if any, but above all the consumer. I should like to make a proposal for the benefit of consumers, and I am not sure whether it will be welcomed or not: why not ask consumers what they want to know? In this way, we will know which potential label consumers are able to read and to understand, and thus perhaps make it much simpler than the complicated labels we have today. Why must consumers not know that they have the choice of drinking a litre of milk from Europe or a litre of milk from Brazil? It will be for them to choose whether a litre of Brazilian milk is better than a litre of milk produced in the European Union. Be that as it may, I consider and I hope that this report will be useful for Commissioner Cioloş by providing further details to help grow that thread I referred to earlier: the land, the producer, the processor, if any, the consumer, safety and, above all on the issue of safety, quality. We have all spoken about quality, and I believe that we are all in favour of raising the quality of our produce even more if it means eating well and eating healthily. Giancarlo Scotta',

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to stress my doubts about the proposal to extend the 2009-2010 intervention period for butter and skimmed milk powder, since this proposal is in danger of turning short-term measures designed for the current crisis in the market into structural measures that would actually restore the dairy farming sector to the position it was in before quotas were introduced. In an effort to make the market measures more balanced, where benefits are not given solely to those Member States involved in butter and skimmed milk powder production, I call for the reintroduction of Community aid for private storage of cheese with a long maturation period. Lastly, I would like to draw your attention to the matter of the origin marking and labelling of dairy products and to the traceability of products: this is a request that comes directly from European consumers – in ever greater numbers – and one that might help us to tackle the crisis in the dairy farming sector. I hope that my fellow Members from the other groups, too, can endorse this proposal. Oreste Rossi  (EFD

 The European Commission must decide once and for all whether it wants to have a Solidarity Fund that responds to serious natural disasters and shows solidarity with those affected rapidly and promptly or whether it wants to indulge in some form of worthless public image exercise. We are dealing here with measures for European civil protection that require prompt provision of assistance to those in difficulty and the European Commission is not capable of releasing the financial assistance to help the earthquake victims of Emilia-Romagna. The proposal to obtain funds through redeployment, from sources that currently amount to EUR 13 million is ridiculous and the Commission should be ashamed of it. I also wish to underline that the European Commission is currently deciding whether to demand that enterprises return the assistance they received for flooding in 1994 and paid out to them by the Italian government, without realising that this would mean certain bankruptcy. I think that the Commission should seriously rethink its position, because it seems to have no knowledge whatsoever of the problems that are being discussed here today, or what it means to be affected by natural disasters.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution is based on a perfectly acceptable principle, which I myself have expressed more than once, underlining both the threat posed by climate change and the fact that it needs to be dealt with at an international level, but by all parties. It is wrong, however, to ask the European Union to take steps unilaterally to cut emissions by 50 % over the levels of the 1990s by 2050. It should be evident that if we continue to depress European industry, we encourage relocation of large enterprises to third countries. Unlike the members of the committee, I consider the Durban Package to be insufficient because no binding global agreement was reached on reduction of emissions. It is sheer madness to think of embarking on the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol unilaterally, in the absence of the United States, the Russian Federation, Japan and Canada, with uncertainty regarding Australia and New Zealand, and knowing that the great polluters such as China, India, Brazil and Indonesia continue to lack emissions reduction targets.

 I support the text of the report on the ‘Offshore Protocol’ because I believe there is a need for increased safety of offshore oil and gas exploitation activities, especially following the dramatic accident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Offshore activities in the Mediterranean are likely to increase due to the discovery of new reserves of fossil fuel, and an accident of such kind could have immediate large-scale effects on a semi-closed sea such as the Mediterranean, causing tragic consequences for its economy and its fragile ecosystems, and undermining the efforts made by EU Mediterranean coastal Member States to achieve and maintain good environmental status in their marine waters as required by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. In view of the importance of this Protocol on exploration and exploitation in the Mediterranean, the removal of harmful waste and the removal of disused installations, I hope that it will be complied with and implemented with provisions on safety and monitoring.

 I am in favour of the text under examination, which seeks the implementation of promotion measures and information provision for agricultural products. I believe that, for consumers to eat properly, they should be properly informed, with the product origin shown on the label. That is the only way of guaranteeing food safety. This policy aims to promote local markets, developing the concept of low food miles and at the same time enhancing market potential in the EU. I also support the promotion of information campaigns on quality wines, aimed at responsible consumption and – this should not be underestimated – the need to educate children on the importance of a healthy, balanced diet based on fruit, vegetables, etc. provided that these are of good quality. The quality policy for agricultural products should therefore on the one hand provide farmers with the tools to identify products with special characteristics and promote them more effectively and on the other protect them from unfair practices.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what concerns me is that I do not think we are the ones being irresponsible by being in favour of the extraction of something that could make Europe self-sufficient in terms of fossil fuels; it is the Greens criticising this stance who are irresponsible because they are fine about keeping themselves warm – obviously I do not think they stay cold – with the same or similar products imported from third countries where mining and drilling is done at the risk of causing earthquakes. You see, if you take oil or gas out from under the ground you create the same voids that are formed by extracting shale gas. So this is fine for other countries but it should not happen in Europe. We have to spend taxpayers’ money paying for stuff from third countries when we could – this is only a possibility – we could be self-sufficient with stuff we produce in Europe. At this point something does not make sense to me and I start to wonder whether the Greens have some other hidden agenda. I will close by saying that I really think caring for the environment is important, but I do not think we should miss this opportunity to extract something that could make Europe economically self-sufficient from the point of view of oil and gas extraction.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Ms Sartori because, with this initiative, we are finally able to discuss a problem that has affected hundreds of thousands of workers who, due to rash decisions that force the European Union to tackle climate change unilaterally and excessively, face losing their jobs. Steelworks, as major energy consumers, are even more crippled by the European Commission’s decision to withdraw some of the ETS quotas already distributed and its determination to set a minimum price for future auctions. This decision by the European Commission, which I criticised during a debate within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, will mainly affect the steelworks themselves, which already lost 10 % of their market share in 2011 and in 2012 stand to lose a further 12 %.

Moreover, we must not underestimate the presence of child pornography websites, which can put at risk the lives of the very youngest, and of people who try to lure minors. It is for schools to train minors in the practical and critical use of the digital technology associated with the internet.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this presentation proposes objectives that we all support, such as combating unemployment, reintegrating the unemployed, relaunching small and medium-sized enterprises, guaranteeing the security of pension schemes – but it does not propose any measures for meeting these challenges. For example, it does not go into any depth in considering which resources the Member States should use to deal with the crisis, nor does it criticise the scandalous choice made by the European Commission in financing the banks without using the funds awarded to bring about economic upturn, thus allowing the credit institutions not to help businesses and families but to acquire government securities, ensuring a guaranteed profit for themselves at almost no risk. Accordingly, the decision was taken, in a period of crisis like this, to finance the banks rather than to encourage an improvement in the economic structure. It would have been an excellent proposal to call on the Commission to propose removing the prohibition on direct aid to the States by the European Central Bank.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rosy picture painted by President Barroso contrasts with a reality that is plain to see: millions of workers protesting for job and wage security so as to be able to support their families and hundreds of thousands of small enterprises in difficulty. In Italy there has been a wave of suicides by small business owners, suffering side-by-side with their employees, because your friend Mr Monti only wants to help the banks and could not care less if the whole system of small and medium-sized enterprises, which has been so much a part of our country socially and industrially, disappears. I would also like underline one case that could be seen as emblematic of a Europe that is standing by and watching the death of its industrial, productive and above all manufacturing capacity. Anomalies in European funding have been discussed, but there is one instance of funding that stands out from all the rest. You have awarded the brother of Totò Riina EU funding. The brother, in other words, of the boss of bosses of the Italian mafia. And you granted funding to another boss while he was still in prison. Well that is a disgrace!

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's discussion, which doubtless reprises other previous discussions, gives us a fairly limited picture of the problem, in my humble opinion. We cannot tackle the social problem and the social aspects and implications of this large-scale restructuring, which do not just affect the companies mentioned by the Commissioner. In Italy, for example, Fiat’s chief executive is misleading the public, and more importantly Fiat’s employees, by saying, ‘Don’t worry, our new products will be sold on the US market’, when everyone knows very well that the US market has no need for more imports; it is quite capable of meeting its future production requirements, even though it seems to have its own problems which are very different from Europe’s. In Europe there is no industrial policy for the automotive sector: we have a European Union which is dilly-dallying and has failed to come up with a sound plan, in view of social and other developments. The market has completely changed, and Europe needs to wake up. It needs to do something, because we need to maintain and conserve the level of quality and the technological and development capacity of manufacturing, especially in a key sector such as the European automotive industry.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Erasmus programme should be defended tooth and claw for the rights and future of our young people. It would be much better to cut the super-high pay and pensions of our senior officials, those untouchables of the European Union, or to reduce the gifts to high finance and the banking system. Some practical suggestions have been made by young people involved in Erasmus. During the Erasmus Day Live initiative, some suggestions were made to President Barroso such as exchanging homes, which could make it easier and less expensive for families, or introducing some working hours (young people want to work, and they could do so in libraries and archives, or in cultural institutions), and regionalisation. Some regions like my own, Piedmont, have suggested intervening along the lines of the principle of subsidiarity. Let us expand the basis for participation in Erasmus, let us give young people the role of offering suggestions and taking action. Erasmus is important. We critics of Europe are more supportive of Erasmus than some pro-Europeans, who want to cut not high-level bureaucracy, not costs or waste – good heavens, no! – but the things that serve the future of young people in Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not find this banking union convincing, because it seems to have no purpose other than to place a fine gravestone over any prospect of adopting the legal principles of the Glass-Steagall Act in Europe. In that respect, how can we not share the concern expressed by Georg Fahrenschon, the president of the German savings banks association, for whom a banking union with centralised supervision in the hands of the European Central Bank (ECB) and a common deposit guarantee fund is like a life assurance policy for ‘systemic’ banks, in other words those banks – not all of them – whose bellies are full of derivative rubbish? We are all well aware of that, but nobody dares say it! This solution will ensure that healthy banks, such as savings banks (not only the German ones but also the ones in Padania) and cooperative banks, which are close to the land, the people and the regions – you may recall the message given out yesterday by 2 million Catalans who want their freedom – will foot the bill so that the sick ones can continue to speculate. I would like to ask a final question: every day, Mario Draghi, the President of the ECB, says that the euro is irreversible.

For Italy, unless the European Stability Mechanism’s role as a panacea is fully supported by the ECB – something that remains to be seen – Mr Monti’s victory will be exactly like Italy’s football win against Germany: a Pyrrhic victory. Perhaps we can be saved from this danger of a future debacle by Our Lady of Fátima, but certainly not by your indecision, uncertainty or by pulling the wool over our eyes. Is what came out of the corridors of your summit true or not? Namely, the fear of Heads of State or Government that there will be a massive collapse in the banking sector which holds billions of derivatives thanks to your inattention, to tax havens, to everything that you allowed to happen. Why then, are you not straight with us about the heart of this problem: not state securities, but the great banking and financial collapse of the derivatives market, of financial speculation, given free rein by a certain world of finance that rules in Europe, and unfortunately also in my country now?

Current events force us to think about a completely different Europe: participatory, united, regional. A century ago, a certain Luigi Sturzo, exiled in England and writing in the English newspapers, was more modern in his thinking than this House, which refuses to consider Europe’s problems from the point of view of territories and regions, which is to say the productive, hard-working world which is the reality for our people. Today, I would like to represent the people of the industrial triangle of agricultural production of Mantua, Ferrara and Modena, where a major seismic event has caused serious problems for one of the most important productive centres in Europe. However, aside from a few visits by Mr Tajani and Mr Barroso, which I concede are important and which I must acknowledge, there has been no debate on practical issues. There is no central intervention on the ground that responds to the expectations of these communities. This Europe thinks in a Brussels way, like our centralist states! Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when this declaration was written, perhaps no one envisaged that, when the time came to debate it, the spread would have been consistently over 500 and, God forbid, even at 600 for Spain and, God forbid indeed, for Italy too. So, we want to combat speculation. This morning, President Barroso extolled to us the virtues of his solution of creating a European banking union. This, however, actually amounts to a way for the European Union to get its hands on our savings. Banking union will not protect European savers. National governments will lose any powers that they have or want to have over their respective national banking systems, whose contents will be poured into an undifferentiated melting pot of debt. In essence, banking union is an attempt, and quite a blatant one at that, to ward off insolvency in the Spanish banking system today by using the savings of the other euro area Member States, even poor Italy, harshly enough. It seems, then, to be a preventive strike against the growing support for the real reform that could solve the problem of this bankrupt system: in other words, banking separation or the Glass-Steagall Act. Essentially, this means separating savings banks from investment banks, which is the only way to prevent savings from being used to plug gaps or being lost when the speculators fail. We are witnessing the umpteenth attempt to contain a crisis by isolating it, as if the crisis were not affecting the entire euro area. This attempt must be stopped before it is too late.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the previous government was right to put a stop to the constant migration flows in circumstances that certainly did not allow a reception worthy of the name. One reason is that the centres – and the report is very vague on this issue – are regularly destroyed by their delightful occupants, whether they are illegal or irregular migrants, and of course Europe, the muggins in this whole affair, pays for this destruction with its taxes. It is true that the European Union has provided significant aid, but part of this has been, has had to be used to rebuild what the kind third-country nationals have destroyed, at the cost of European taxpayers. And we should have the courage to set this down on paper! Just as with regard to human rights, when these missions take place, we should also be concerned about making sure that the rights of workers are respected, as I have always done when I have been involved. Police forces and staff have to be protected, given that there have been cases of murder. Therefore, the government has done the right thing in regulating this emergency and these flows efficiently and energetically, in an attempt to help protect Europe’s external borders.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that in its laudable desire to help develop, aid and, I would suggest, influence the meaning and direction of the Arab revolutions in the sense of opening up towards democracy and economic development based, obviously, on a productive economy, the Commission has failed to meet its objective by linking all of this to the possibility of exporting agricultural products, etc. Undoubtedly, some pertinent comments have been made on this subject, because if we deprive these countries of their agricultural products, we impoverish them. In addition, why do we not start thinking seriously about the role of our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in order to introduce them there as a real work-training tool, which your bureaucrats cannot do as it can only really be done by those who know how SMEs are created, and that is by our small and medium-sized enterprise owners. Let us therefore encourage them to cooperate. Cooperation and economic recovery can only take place from the bottom up, with serious, concrete actions, not statements of principle and philosophical comments, which achieve nothing.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before making my case I feel that I must tip my hat to Mr López Aguilar, the Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for the very balanced way he conducted the debate and for his most dignified and sober words, which I do not think anyone has dared to refute with any sincerity or good reason. This morning, rather than getting into a series of philosophical or jurisprudential debates, we ought to take a responsible look at our fellow citizens’ right to safety. In particular we need to be thinking about those people such as workers and young people who have been victims of terrorist attacks on trains, perhaps, carrying workers, young people, and so on. We need to think about the right to safety, which must prevail over our personal and political considerations and those of a Eurosceptic group which I do not think will be able to vote in favour, as Mr Batten said. The Lega Nord
 Members of the House, meanwhile, will definitely vote in favour of this measure, not because we are not receptive to the serious and well-founded concerns over privacy, but because we think that right now there is a risk of widespread and possibly nuclear terrorism hanging over the world.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barroso has announced measures for small and medium-sized enterprises, but is he aware that in my land, Padania, every day a funeral is held for a small business owner who has committed suicide because his company is in debt and he does not have the money to pay his staff, and his staff are at his funeral? Your ‘non-solutions’ are taking the ship of the European economy and finance straight towards the iceberg of large-scale international speculation, and you do not seem to be aware of it. Let us consider these ‘non-solutions’ – the ‘bail-out fund’, a body not controlled by the EU institutions, but by stakeholders of the international financial lenders, and then this gigantic – the Chair of the European Central Bank (ECB) is not here – but we need to be brave enough to say that there is a gigantic conflict of interest between taxpayers, the European citizens that we represent, and the bosses of the ECB, that is, the gentlemen from the big central banks, which, in turn, are owned by private banks and by private finance. This conflict of interest should frighten us. Come on, let us leave the single currency, let us go back to our national currencies ...  (The President cut off the speaker) Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Madam President, I will use my explanation of vote – having voted for this report – to draw the attention of the House, or at least what remains of the House, to a very important statement, the statement by the Nobel prize-winning economist, Joseph Stiglitz, who – we read in the periodical of the University of Columbia, where he lectures in economics – has revealed that the decisions of the European Central Bank (ECB) are made according to instructions from a little-known organisation called the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. These statements are, at the very least, worrying. Does the European Union intend to find out whether these significant and weighty statements are true? Because of all the things we find out about derivatives, one thing is certain, and that is that there is an organisation and a mysterious trafficking that allows the system of major international speculation to decide on the policies which then affect actual people, working men and women who are responsible for producing in Member States, and this does not correspond to our vision of a Europe which needs to be a Europe of people and regions, not of bankers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have this morning heard many criticisms of the French President’s electoral posturing on immigration and on Schengen. This criticism has been developed from the point of view and through the lens of populism. Fair enough. I would like to apply the same analysis to the news in all the major European dailies yesterday and today. I am referring to the important stance taken by the greatest progressive European philosopher, the elderly but very clear-sighted Mr Habermas, who has looked at the reform, the fiscal compact, from a very specific point of view. He says that this reform, this pact, should not be approved because it is like wanting to increase, or rather, fooling ourselves that we want to increase, integration among Member States without civic integration among citizens. He says that it highlights the fact that only a democratic Europe, only popular will – even expressed through a referendum I would say, but that is my opinion – could produce politically credible decisions. He calls the European Union arrogant in its dealings with citizens and dominated by speculators. I had grown used to quoting Junger, but from now on, I will quote Habermas when criticising, from a populist and democratic point of view, your bad decisions which impact on the people. Maybe they are taken by the inner circle – the inner circle of the Bilderberg or Trilateral meetings – but they are obviously not taken here. Such decisions are then imposed on the people, without caring one jot about the real economy of those who work and sweat, workers and entrepreneurs. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have heard much harsh criticism of the Dutch Government’s guidelines with regard to family reunification. These criticisms of a country, which, in the full exercise of its sovereignty, is adopting more restrictive rules on such a delicate issue, one so closely related to the fundamental issue of immigrant integration, call to mind an official government document, which will be presented today, of all days, in Rome. This is the eighth report on immigration published by the Italian National Council of Economy and Labour (CNEL) – an Italian constitutional body – showing that the Italian regions and provinces in which integration has been most fully and seriously implemented are those in the north, and particularly in the north-east: that is, precisely those regions – such as the Veneto – governed by the Northern League, a movement which many in this Chamber regard as xenophobic. This leads me to believe that it is precisely the adoption of strict rules, of a substantial immigration filter, that can lead to true integration. Moreover, this is what emerges not from a biased opinion, but from an official government document, with constitutional status in my country. Let us therefore examine these proposed rules. Are they rules fit for the Third Reich or are they reasonable norms? When an immigrant, in order to obtain family reunification, is required to demonstrate that he has a job, a certain economic stability, etc.; when strict measures are called for with regard to the shameful scam of forced marriages or marriages of convenience, all we are asking for is European standards. In short, what we want are standards compatible with European judicial culture. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an excellent and balanced report which also rightly refers to the principle of subsidiarity, and therefore recognises the important and pre-eminent role played by Member States. The report, however, also paints a picture of a multi-speed Europe. As far as my country is concerned, there are two speeds. On the one hand, there are certain cities and regions – for example, Naples and Campania – that are a source of shame for those of us who, for the moment, have identity cards issued by the Italian State, a great source of shame that we continue to denounce. On the other hand, there are the virtuous towns of Padania where we have hundreds of mayors, for example, those of the Northern League, who may be ‘barbarian dreamers’, but who are also civilised people who teach citizens and ensure that they sort their rubbish and who organise the collection and incineration of waste. This civilised part of our country is an example for Europe. So let us move forward in this direction. I welcome the petitions which also inform the European authorities of these situations which, as I have said before, in Campania also pose a threat to European tourists who risk setting foot in those areas.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Ms Alfano can look at the European Parliament website where, modestly speaking, I am described as President of the provisional government of Padania. This is an official document of the European Parliament. Also, when she leaves her mafia homeland to come up north, she can see road signs saying ‘Higher Padania’ or ‘Lower Padania’. It was not invented by Mr Bossi; it is the civilised land of us Padanians, barbarian dreamers. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, complying with the rules certainly does not mean abdicating one’s sovereignty. Furthermore I do not believe that the rules referred to and described justify effectively being put in the dock, because this is the earnest desire of many groups that remained silent when democratic demonstrations were repressed elsewhere, in Belgium for example, and three parliamentarians were put in prison because they wanted to commemorate September 11th. Mr Orbán, today all the patriots among us feel Hungarian, feel proud to be Hungarian, and we envy your people for experiencing a new-found freedom after conquering it in the way that it did. Come and visit us in Padania, where you will receive a hero’s welcome, because we welcome those who defend their sovereignty. You will be welcomed as a Prime Minister who, unlike others such as our own Prime Minister, is not a servant to powerful lobbies, and perhaps this is why you do not have the favour of international finance, given that it seems to want to tie the financial hands of a free Hungary, denying it the support that is provided without question to every other country in difficulty. I believe it is time to say that perhaps our peoples should be the ones to open infringement proceedings against those who, without a popular vote, have devolved their sovereignty to others, have abandoned their sovereignty, starting with monetary sovereignty, and I invite you to defend your country's monetary sovereignty. Those of us who have abandoned it anti-democratically and without consultation find ourselves in this fine financial situation. Courage, Mr Orbán, carry on along this route.

 Mr President, I am really afraid that the meagre, disappointing results of the Brussels summit mark an historic moment: the end of the historical inevitability of European unity. That should be a cause for concern, particularly to those who have always shown themselves to be enthusiastic about Europe. The summit was, in fact, a pointless farce that has not calmed speculation, let alone stopped it. One fact certainly makes us realise that investors are afraid of a euro default soon. The European Banking Authority revealed it when it announced that some 40 banks in the European Economic Area have sold EUR 170 billion of credit default swaps (CDS) on Greek, Irish, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish bonds. The soaring CDS market is a sure sign that the markets are afraid of a default, that there is a lack of confidence, that speculation is rising and that investors are waving goodbye to Europe, thus giving speculation free rein. The euro as a currency is heading for disaster, since the markets are tending to reject it. This is the result you have achieved. Congratulations! Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a few hours ago President Van Rompuy declared that the Member States need to renounce their sovereignty in order to find a solution to rescue the economic and financial situation in the euro area and in Europe. This could prove a huge sacrifice for those who, every day, or at least during celebrations, such as the 150th anniversary of the unification of Italy, flock together and pride themselves on symbols of national unity and flags. It may be less of a sacrifice for us representatives of Padania, but I ask President Van Rompuy and the other exponents of the European elite: what will we get in return for renouncing our national sovereignty? A bluff, because where are we going to get, for example, the EUR 400-600 billion in aid that Italy is being promised, at least according to the rumours that are circulating? Certainly not from the International Monetary Fund. As regards intervention by the European Central Bank, there is the seemingly insurmountable obstacle of the Treaties, and so we ask ourselves: are these requests genuine, or are they a bluff? Are we taking things seriously? What are we talking about? I believe that Italy’s present situation, with its three-year government bonds standing at 8%, does not offer much in the way of hope, at least not in the short and medium terms. This is extremely worrying! I should also like to learn more about the Plan B that various States are rumoured to be preparing – it is even being said that Germany is preparing to mark euros with an indelible inscription that is supposed to guarantee the German character of those euros. We should like to learn more from Mr Monti’s mysterious advisors. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would say to Mr Posselt that sovereignty represents the cultural and hence political identity of the Member States. It is inalienable from the point of view of, say, belonging, and the Union that our free countries have built through European integration must never overlook, overshadow or abolish the principle of national sovereignty, which must remain in force unless we accept – which we shall never do – a certain principle: that of the construction of a superstate that destroys the identity and hence also the rights and freedoms of the individual States and the individual regions.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to talk of the usual programme of cuts to financial revenue and the fight against speculation, but I hear little of anything concrete. Instead, one should speak clearly about separating banks that are collection oriented from those that are speculation oriented, such as Goldman Sachs, which, in fact, seems to have become the calling card with which you present us the saviours of Greece and the saviours of Italy. I do not believe in a European Union which imposes these characters as a diktat
, these characters who are all authoritative members of those estimable consortia such as the Trilateral Commission or the Bilderberg Club, which also bring together the protagonists, the heads of the European Union, without admitting any outsiders, because these protagonists are from a place where secret decisions are made – decisions which then have an impact on the people. You always talk about cuts – cuts on the real economy and cuts on salaries and pensions, but never about cuts on the profits made by banks, and never about cuts on finance chiefs. What a great epilogue for our country’s celebrations for 150 years of national unity – the total sell-out of Italian sovereignty to the mighty powers of the lords of the world! Congratulations!

 Opposition to Bulgaria and Romania joining the Schengen area is due to what should be one of the mainstays of European policy: the precautionary principle. In fact, it is to be expected that some Member States, already subject to intense flows of immigration, may be put under increasing strain with the entry into the Schengen area of two countries that do not seem to have achieved sufficient control of their external borders. This is particularly clear with regard to the border between Bulgaria and Turkey. We cannot allow the free movement of citizens unless we are satisfied that this does not lead to increases in petty crime and illegal immigration, reductions in security and risks to public order. The data on the fight against organised crime in these two countries are hardly comforting for those who desire to see a serious and effective EU policy against organised crime. Mario Borghezio,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Angelides report by the US Congress Commission of inquiry has clearly demonstrated that the crisis was avoidable and has pointed the finger at public operators and the financial system, referring to those responsible by name: the Federal Reserve, rating agencies, investment banks and the five major US banks responsible have all been blamed for the ongoing crisis. Even today, these practices are going on. The Commission of inquiry’s findings were preceded by the very serious, yet unheeded, warning that was also given by the crisis committee led by the Nobel Prize-winning economist, Maurice Allais. Unfortunately, the report does not say much about all this and, bowing to the superior knowledge of those economists – nearly all of them in fact – who were unable to predict the crisis, it overlooks today what is a key proposal for those who want to get to the root of the problem: to re-establish the principles of the Glass-Steagall Act, aimed at separating the activities of traditional banks from those of investment and merchant banks – speculation, in other words – and to prohibit the creation and trading of financial derivatives. The report also disregards one of the key aspects of this powerful formula, which is necessary to ensure a financial recovery and to successfully combat corruption through the use of drastic measures. Lastly, how can one ignore the negative impact of the crisis on a serious problem such as immigration? Mario Borghezio,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate comes at a very opportune time, a time that follows an emergency that it would not be right nor intelligent to underestimate, if only we think of what is happening and, unfortunately, will perhaps continue to happen, in Libya. With these scenes in North Africa, do we want to disregard the possibility that there can be an emergency two times, 10 times, God forbid, one hundred times greater? A great French author, Jean Raspail, had predicted it many decades ago, and today we are very close to this situation. So let us give it proper consideration before criminalising a small liberal country such as Denmark, which decides to defend its own borders. I am prepared to praise borders, and we should not criminalise the existence of borders. When controls are needed and when a country considers prioritising the safety of its citizens, it is necessary to respect that decision and that should be democracy according to the rules shared by all European countries. Thus let us pay great attention to and let us reflect with great concern on the danger of a biblical exodus from Africa. This danger exists and is very close, very close indeed … (The President cut off the speaker) Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have two observations to make with regard to the own-initiative report on the common agricultural policy. The first is that the consumer prices of agricultural products must be commensurate with the costs, effort and work, but also with the production costs, if we want European consumers to be able to eat healthy products of European agriculture, of the traditional agriculture that must be preserved. The second comment concerns a signal to the competent European authorities. Are they aware of the report by the Italian Carabinieri of the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies concerning milk quotas? This report clearly shows that the milk production quota, which was supposed to have been exceeded, thus forming the legal basis for the fines levied on Italian dairy farmers, was not in fact exceeded. This is very serious, because these fines could bring thousands of farms in Padania to their knees and drive them to bankruptcy. Free Padania! Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of Greece I will say that one only needs to listen to what has been discussed to realise what stage European governance is at. In fact it is steering by sight, with no precise aims. We have not been told anything for which I would keep my fingers crossed if I were a Greek citizen – perhaps a Greek worker or a small Greek entrepreneur facing ruin. As regards immigration, I have heard Italy criticised for not wanting to accept any refugees. A few hours ago, however, Mrs Malmström issued a public statement saying that when the tragedy of the Libyan exodus began everyone undertook to receive at least 800 refugees per country. In practice, nobody is receiving them, and she highlighted the positive case of Norway. They land in Lampedusa and a few in Malta, and we are the only ones taking them in. Italy has received them. Italy. People were talking about Minister Bossi, and there is also the Home Affairs Minister, Mr Maroni: both ministers are from this racist Lega Nord
 party, which has received the refugees. Unless there is proof to the contrary, that is the truth. Lastly there is the Croatia chapter. It is very important for Croatia to join, but it is also important to remember that the Pope warned the Croats to beware of a bureaucratic, centralist structure. Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, Article 4(2) of the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union states that verification, in accordance with evaluation procedures, that the necessary conditions for the application of the Schengen acquis have been met by the new Member States is an essential requirement for the Council to decide to abolish internal border controls with those States. Now, we believe that there would be an urgent need to establish regulatory and operational conditions preventing undesirable elements, who could undermine the security of Member States, from slipping into the EU unnoticed via Bulgaria and Romania, but our assessment is that those conditions do not exist today. The reports being discussed in Parliament are not reassuring because of the grave deficiencies which still exist at air, land and sea borders, starting with the performance of border controls. It is not surprising that our police forces are faced with numerous cases of illegal immigrants coming from those two countries every day. I suggest that we need to suspend the entry process to the Schengen scheme for Bulgaria and Romania as a precaution, not least in view of the foreseeably enormous pressure on the external borders of these two countries, which are becoming the holes in the Swiss cheese that is the European Union system regarding the entry of illegal immigrants.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this issue has the merit of having brought great hypocrisy to light. The only government within the European Union that has an interior minister from a party which you define as populist is the one that has had the courage to implement the most humanitarian measure: giving 25 000 Tunisian people permission to move freely. This is because we saw in the flesh that they were not 25 000 criminals, but people who had fled Tunisia. It was an emergency, we had to face it with common sense and we have tried to help. This shows a truth, namely that in many situations the real ‘goodies’ are us, the ‘baddies’. We who affirm the need to control immigration and external borders, continue to beg Europe – as Mr Cohn-Bendit has rightly done – to spread what might become 50 000 or 100 000 refugees across its territory, because the people who flee Libya are not criminals. These are the clear words of a movement which defends territory and identity, which is against immigration because it does not want people to be uprooted, and which condemns racism and xenophobia but also hypocrisy.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, despite being a Eurosceptic, I could be in favour of a plan, in view of the 2020 Strategy, to eliminate discrimination, difficulty and marginalisation if we were really being offered incisive action by the European Commission to control the behaviour of Member States. What we have, however, are these speeches about a great future, about great control, spoken by a European Commissioner who still cannot explain to me how it is that in her country, in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, these travellers are forbidden to set up camp whereas they can instead instal themselves close to my home, in Italy and in France. Thus we talk of giving a home to travellers, whilst in some European countries, specifically that of Mrs Reding, these people cannot even set up camp. In today’s edition of the main newspaper in my country, Il Corriere della Sera
, there is an article on a parent, who does not deserve to be called a parent, a traveller, who was arrested in Italy for selling her own little girl to traffickers who wanted to sell her into prostitution. She sold her own little girl. Others send them to do other things. Often it is they who do not to send them to school, despite pressure and attention from the authorities, mediators and charities. Do we want to talk about these problems as well?

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank Commissioner Malmström for her hard work week after week in dealing with this epic disaster – because that is what it is. Comments have been made, not only in this House, in an attempt to reduce and make light of what our government, our country and our people have had to face. It has been, and continues to be, an emergency –humanitarian and otherwise – of exceptional dimensions. I believe that our government, and especially our people, have really come out of this well in terms of international public opinion. The people of Lampedusa behaved remarkably in firstly welcoming the migrants and then helping them out of their own pockets, and then, at a certain point, they said ‘we cannot do this any more’, because in addition to the human rights we discuss every day in this House, we must also consider the rights of peoples, including their right to maintain their identity, their activities and, naturally, not to be invaded. The migrants also include illegal immigrants, criminals released from prison. This rightly concerns the countries that must accept them. Furthermore, when the migration takes on the dimension – I repeat – of an invasion, we need to face up to the issue. We are one hundred per cent with our people, no ifs or buts. The European Union must stand up and take note, Commissioner. In addition to human rights, we must consider our rights, the rights of indigenous peoples. For this reason, we fully endorse the efforts being made by Italian Government at the moment in Tunisia, because compared to the modest figures announced by the Commissioner, the Italian Government is offering Tunisia a lot. A lot is being done and we are confident we will achieve tangible results However, we must move from words to deeds and Frontex is not doing what should have been done to put an end to this hateful traffic, because this traffic is the shame of the Mediterranean and the European Union is partly responsible. Therefore, I say put a stop to people trafficking and I say yes to a Marshall Plan for these countries. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that at such a delicate time for the finances of the Member States of Europe, as was said a short time ago, I should like to sound an alarm about an expenditure that is under discussion in the Committee on Budgets: the astonishing case of the vast expenses set aside for the House of European History. I think it would be a disgrace if it were approved. We already own the Eastman Building, but between EUR 26 million and EUR 31 million have been allocated merely for renovation costs, plus EUR 3.3 million for the plans alone. The fixed costs amount to more than EUR 3 million whilst the variable costs come to EUR 3.2 million, plus EUR 3.2 million for a 50-strong staff, EUR 2 million for security and then EUR 13.45 million are required just to manage it. I think we ought to set an example of prudent spending through our institutions. This, however, would be a disgrace. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, of course we must recognise the serious errors of the West. We in Italy have made the mistake of thinking of Mr Gaddafi as ‘our son of a bitch’, as President Roosevelt would have said, while instead, he was simply one of the many sons of … that rule over their people and now even fire on them or make other people fire on them. How on earth has no one in Parliament mentioned the responsibility of the African Heads of State or Government, who, until yesterday morning, thought of him as a brother, pampered him, sent him to the United Nations as a representative leader for the defence of human rights, even leading him to declare himself the king of kings amongst African countries, or have I got the wrong person? Now, Europe is making another mistake: it pretends to ignore an obvious danger, as a great flood of Somalis, Eritreans and others flee Libya’s borders. We need to tackle this with real energy. We should use a Marshall Plan involving the network of small and medium-sized enterprises to help these people, not send weapons. *** Mario Borghezio,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not agree with the report where it says that the Commission should dictate policy on the Roma to the Member States. This approach does not obey the principle of subsidiarity, if it is true – as indeed it is – that these measures must be conceived and carried out at local, regional and national levels, since their impact is then on the regions and their native populations. I completely agree with inclusion, not discrimination, but I am still waiting to hear from Commissioner Reding when Roma camps will finally be allowed in her country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, for if I am not mistaken, they are not allowed there. This report seems to be a little unbalanced, because so many paragraphs call for support for the Roma, be they men, women, children, the elderly (...). None of them call for any measures to severely punish those Roma who show anti-social behaviour, for example. Who stops Roma children going to school, if it is not certain Roma parents? I believe these are topics that we need to have the courage to spell out clearly, defying political correctness. It is not the syrup of do-goodism but serious, surgical measures that will enable us to lance the boil of rackets, child exploitation and organ trafficking. Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Energy 2020 is a vast programme, but we should ask ourselves if we can achieve the target of 20% renewable energy by the due date, not least because the financial crisis is slowing investment. There remains one problem: supporting solar energy. Indeed, we subsidise China, now the world’s leading exporter of solar panels, and India, the leading exporter of wind power equipment. Hence the need to support research into the production of solar panels designed and produced in Europe and to promote the adoption of economies of scale in the photovoltaic-solar sector, by introducing such devices, for example, extensively in European cities. Something very different should have been done: a pan-European energy company should have been set up to safeguard a European public service, given that the distribution networks and their infrastructures already constitute existing, natural monopolies, which should clearly come under the same management. Instead, due to over-enthusiastic economic liberalism, priority was given to other solutions that certainly do not benefit consumers or users, but the shareholders of these big monopolies. We should remember that the production of CO2
 from cars has not dropped for 150 years. We are entitled to wonder if it could be time to dust off research projects into water engines. Mario Borghezio,

 Mr President, this will certainly not be remembered as an exhilarating chapter in Parliament’s history. The criticisms and attacks rained down on the Hungarian Government, in conjunction with the EU Presidency, with regard to the Hungarian media law’s alleged total failure to comply with European legislation, have been reduced to what they really are: an instrumental and specious attempt that, apart from anything else, is based entirely on ideological bias, which is even more shameful when it is used against a country that today has the struggle for freedom encoded in its DNA – and this has indeed been the case throughout its history, which we all remember very well. The political forces that have promoted this far from exhilarating debate are still heavily weighed down by the responsibility for what is certainly not a high level political manoeuvre. Rather, it is seriously invalidated by these purely ideological overtones, and it also has the failing of casting an undeserved shadow on the European Union Presidency, which is being held for the first time – and this is certainly a great political and historical fact – by a former communist country, joined with us today in freedom.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are grateful to the Commissioner for the commitments that have been made, although it should be said that with all the salaries the European Union pays around the world – with 136 diplomatic missions – it could perhaps have realised what was happening sooner. In fact, the situation was not even foreseen by the representatives of the Socialist International, one of whose members was the nice Tunisian dictator, whose brilliant social and political management of that country led to all this. We want to learn from the Commission why it does not talk to us clearly about sharing out these people among the various European countries. It is not fair – as the coastal states have been saying for a long time – that this problem should only affect the countries that have a Mediterranean sea border with North African countries. That is a fundamental point, and it is also fundamental to remember that Frontex has very limited resources: I have heard that two experts have been sent. There is a massive crisis taking place in Lampedusa, not least in humanitarian terms, which needs to be tackled with a task force of appropriate size in order to remedy the mistakes and failures of the recent past. The situation is extremely serious and it may also get worse from a public health point of view, since water has perhaps already begun to run out in Lampedusa. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council needs to look at the fact that Europe’s production system has no defence against the volatility of oil prices on the markets, because futures markets are being held hostage to sophisticated international financial speculation, meaning that prices now have very little to do with the fundamental principles of supply and demand. The Council must set itself the goal of providing the European Union with a practical instrument with which to create a regulated market, open to selected traders and managed by a completely trustworthy European partner. This is the thrust of an Italian Government proposal to create a European oil exchange aimed at establishing a stable oil market, which would be of huge benefit to businesses and consumers. Speculators’ enthusiasm for commodities is influencing oil prices, which are no longer based on the spot market, since the cumulative effect of advances and speculative manoeuvres ends up determining supply and demand in the real market. A European exchange would transform the current ‘non-market’ of paper barrels into an efficient, regulated and monitored real market based on real barrels of oil. We ought to discuss this with the Council as well. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a law has been passed in the United States requiring the Federal Reserve to detail how much of the USD 3 300 billion rescue package has gone to which banks. I wonder whether it would be subversive to ask you to adopt the same transparency criteria, unless the finance and banking super-lobby blocks it. Let us consider the situation: what future is there for this forced Union of free countries, which is based on the stronger countries bailing out the weaker ones? Technically, do we want to acknowledge reality, which is that the euro is a virtually bankrupt currency? How can we think of forcing countries with a weak economy to use it? Is a centralised monetary policy acceptable for countries that have such decidedly diverse interest rates? Mr Trichet himself, who has denied the danger of the European Central Bank becoming insolvent, does, however, admit that one of the reasons behind increasing its capital is to face up to the credit risk, in other words, the insolvency of the bonds purchased. It is also time for new stress tests on the largest banks and to give greater weight to high-risk bank debts, as the Minister for the Economy has requested.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, in the prevailing relativism of European politics, there is one word that is taboo: Christianophobia. For many years, however, serious and often tragic reports have been coming in from reliable and indisputable sources about the persecution of Christians on several continents. Europe needs to wake up, open its eyes and take concrete action. It needs to send out clear messages, such as the one we were expecting from Baroness Ashton. She could, for example, have quoted Pope Benedict’s inspired words for the World Day of Peace a few days ago, when he pointed out that to deny religious freedom is an insult to God and to human dignity, as well as a threat to security and peace. Concrete action is needed. What are we waiting for – as I asked straight away – to send a commission to check the situation of our Coptic Christian brethren in Egypt, an officially moderate country where they have practically no fundamental human rights at all, not even in public office, in the civil service? Wake up, wretched Europe, and remember your Christian roots! Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the New York Times 
revelations, investigations are ongoing in the United States into the secret club of nine banks – one of which is European – whose executives meet every Wednesday to agree what action to take on derivatives. The Crisis Committee was completely unaware and Europe is a mere spectator. The Federal Reserve had to account for the USD 13 trillion spent to bail out the banks. Would you mind telling us what the Fed asked for the European bank rescue packages? Is it not the critical situation in the banks – and not state budgets – that requires the sum in the European rescue fund to be doubled and the preparation of a EUR 2 000 billion bail-out? What is stopping us calling on the European Central Bank to account transparently and in detail for its actions as was done in the United States for the Fed? This would put paid to suspicions that  it acted and continues to act discretionally and not in the common interest of the citizens and taxpayers of the European Union’s Member States. Why on earth have discussions never been held over the adoption of measures to impose a genuine and effective separation between commercial banks and speculative banks, as in the Glass-Steagall Act?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the responses concerning Mr Assange’s case and his imprisonment on account of his ideas of freedom are reminiscent of those of Pontius Pilate. I would like us to consider three points: 1. This is a case of fumus persecutionis
, because the accusations are very weak; 2. the United States is putting pressure on a European country to extradite, even though it has not yet specified the legal grounds for this request; 3. a citizen’s European bank accounts have been closed, meaning that he cannot receive any financial assistance in Europe from his supporters. What is more, all the statistics confirm that the European public is in favour of these principles of freedom, that it wants Internet freedom, that it is in favour of freedom, despite the doubts and the problems that have emerged in the wake of this initiative, which I personally do not fully support. Nevertheless, we would like President Barroso to state what the limits are and what the protection of human rights and of freedom of expression is really and truly founded on. Are we looking at a virtual Guantánamo here? Are we facing the threat of an Orwellian total censorship of the Internet? That is the danger, and we need answers on this matter. It is also important to keep a check on Mr Assange’s prison conditions, because in Italy, not even Mafia members are held in complete isolation. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ears of the President of the European Central Bank, Mr Trichet, must really be burning as this debate continues. If we were in the ancient Roman senate, a senator would surely stand up in his toga and say to Mr Trichet: ‘Quousque tandem abutere
, Trichete, patientia nostra?
’ – how long are you going to try our patience, Mr Trichet? In effect, we must ask ourselves whether the right road is to avoid the dissolution of the euro – a very difficult task – or instead prevent the rescue of the euro from ruining the economies of our Member States after the europhile policies of Mr Prodi and so on have destroyed our industries, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, in Padania for example, bringing only redundancies and unemployment benefit. Why should the countries which are surviving the crisis be bled dry to the tune of almost EUR 100 billion to save Ireland which, with its policy of 12.5% business tax,, has until now been competing unfairly with the other countries? Where was European governance if, one month after passing its stress tests, the Anglo Irish Bank plunged to a deficit of EUR 8 billion? Where was Mr Trichet? Are we sure that the Irish bailout does not violate the Treaty of Maastricht? Fortunately there is a constitutional court in Germany that will declare that the absorption of another country’s deficit onto Germany’s books is unconstitutional. So it is time to say bye-bye euro, bye-bye euro. Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should like to express my sincere and earnest thanks to the rapporteur, whose skills and rigour have been put to good use in guaranteeing Member States that granting free passage to Taiwanese nationals and abolishing visas will not cause problems for the European Union. I am not so convinced about the latest work regarding Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania. Now there is even talk of abolishing visas for Turkey. In those situations, I am not convinced that the Commission and Parliament have done their job well, namely: ensuring the safety of European citizens. Therefore, I applaud the report and the vote in the European Parliament – which will surely be positive – all the more. History is not impermanent. People of a certain age remember what it was that what was once called Nationalist China represented for decades: it was a banner of freedom. The West must not forget who defended the principles of liberty when they were under threat elsewhere. Still now, in terms of human rights, I think a basic distinction must be made. The Chinese of Taiwan are therefore also welcome in my home region of Padania. The presence of such important and skilled individuals in the region already provides ample illustration of the ability of Taiwanese people to integrate into our society. Unlike other countries, Taiwan also has the merit of not exporting socio-political messages against the principles of liberty, the protection of human rights and respect for ethnic and religious minorities to the European Union together with its goods. The citizens of Taiwan are therefore welcome in the European Union and in Padania. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply wanted to call the attention of the President of the European Parliament to a judgment made several days ago. It is a matter that surely falls under the capacities of the Commissioner, to whom I extend my greetings. In my opinion, it is a very serious judgment, because it relativises the content of a very important European Union directive on terrorism. In fact, I believe that it is not possible to support an extensive attitude to protecting citizens who request the right of asylum and the right to be recognised as a refugee to those who belong to terrorist organisations. If this principle were to become accepted, as it did in this extremely serious decision of the European Court of Justice, we shall give many terrorists the chance to benefit from protection that they do not deserve. Too many people have died in Europe as a result of acts of terrorism to allow a situation of this type. I therefore urge the Commission to modify the directive so as to avoid extensive and indecent interpretations of the statement that the European Union rightly made in the fight against terrorism. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should have listened to the advice of the Nobel laureate, Maurice Allais, who called for a clear separation between business banks, credit banks and speculative banks, in accordance with the principles of the Glass-Steagall Act, which is not discussed in this report. As far as the proposal to tax European taxpayers is concerned, my response is ‘No tax in Europe!’ If this European Union proposal goes ahead, you can rest assured that we will have our own Tea Party here as well: there will be a mass protest. The European public has no intention of paying for a service they are not getting and they are perfectly right. We are continuing to fund the banks. However, what are the banks doing in the midst of this economic and financial crisis? They are buying securities, even ones that contain dodgy derivatives and so on. They are still buying them. And what is the ECB doing while this is going on? The ECB – set up to be an unchallengeable body – is letting it go on. It seems clear to me that this is a Europe for bankers. If even the Masonic leaders claim this to be true, I do not see why we cannot claim it too. We believe that there is only one way to combat speculation effectively: transactions carried out at the same time as negotiations are paid for, and only in cash. Mrs Merkel dared to say it and she was shouted down. There must be some reason for that. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Madam President, this is an important and significant report for the protection of women. The European institutions, however, suffer from the major fault of not practising what they preach. Last Friday and Saturday, a meeting attended by the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, the President of Parliament and President Van Rompuy was held with dignitaries from the most important European Masonic lodges, yet not a single word was said about the fact that most of these lodges do not allow women to join. More seriously, the meeting was held inside the European Parliament, behind closed doors, and not even Parliament’s own staff were allowed in. All that stands in contrast to the principles of transparency that should govern all activities of the European institutions. Mario Borghezio,

 Mr President, we will vote against this report not least because the rapporteur proposes exerting pressure on the Commission and the Council to speed up the process of visa liberalisation for Kosovo. Do we realise what we are discussing? Do we realise that Kosovo is finding it difficult to reintegrate the thousands of Roma who sought asylum in Germany? This is an extremely sensitive situation for the entire European Union. Do we realise that visa liberalisation – which I have heard said will be used only by students and respectable people, even though I personally do not agree at all with that optimistic statement – will simply mean that Europe becomes a hotbed of Roma? We really do not need this, considering the serious problems we are facing with integration and resolving the extremely severe problem of the Roma. As far as Albania is concerned, I would like to point out that the Commission again proposed in May that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina should be able to allow their citizens to circulate within the Schengen area with electronic passports. The proposal was not, however, taken forward due to Albania’s shortcomings with regard to reintegrating repatriated Albanians. I believe that security and control issues exist that weigh on visa liberalisation like boulders. We need to think about this very carefully: visas are necessary, and how! Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also award the prize for hypocrisy to Mrs Reding, who forgot to describe – at least according to the texts – the situation of the Roma in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, where the problem of expelling Roma does not exist simply because the setting up of Roma camps is not allowed by law; it is forbidden. Thus, there are many different ‘Europes’. I hope that this is an indication of what is to come: at this European Council, at last, a Head of State or Government felt compelled to teach the European Commission a clear lesson in patriotism. The Commission must not, not even through its Commissioners, allow itself to insult a Member State, in particular, a Member State such as France which could give us all a lesson on the concepts of freedom and humanity. There is a huge difference between what you call European law and the law of the peoples. European law is perhaps the right to enter other people’s houses and steal, not to send your children to school and to exploit them, as asserted not by racist populism, but – according to Le Monde
 – as asserted by the Prime Minister of Romania during the ‘déjeuner de fiel
’ – the ‘lunch as bitter as bile’ – on 16 September. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we did not vote for the motion for a resolution by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which is certainly more balanced, because of one key point to which we wish to draw your attention: the call for the European Commission, for Europe, to speed up the process to integrate Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen area. We feel – and we already sounded this alarm at the time of enlargement – that these countries have not yet adopted strict control policies for the issue of identity cards and recognition of nationality. Are the Commission and Parliament aware that in these countries certificates can be obtained with great ease from non-European countries enabling, thanks to the freedom of movement, illegal entry into the Schengen area? We must pay close attention to this matter, and it is completely irresponsible not to have done so, and to be pressing for the enlargement of the Schengen area, contrary to common sense. Lastly, I would like to voice my hope that, when we next meet, at least one of the do-gooder MEPs who are so supportive of the Roma will report that he or she has taken in – they can afford this on an MEP’s salary – a nice Roma family, and are feeding a few extra mouths. It is not hard to show with actions, instead of just with words, that you are a do-gooder. Mario Borghezio,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to the attacks against the French Government, like those against the Italian Government previously, and also to some very strong attacks against the Commission. These accusations are completely spurious in actual fact. I have not heard any reference to the statistics supplied by the French police authorities showing that, in the 18 months following the exodus of Roma from Bulgaria and Romania, the number of thefts rose by more than 250%. In this connection, perhaps Romania and Bulgaria should be forced to answer some questions, after they were very irresponsibly allowed to enter the European Union without this problem having first been resolved. We must speak frankly to those people, too, who come over as guests of other states. We must tell them to respect the citizens of their host states and not enter their homes illegally and perform acts unbecoming of a guest. They must be respected and they must be protected – in the words of those who speak of high principles – but we must also consider the victims of their crimes: the other honest citizens of the European Union who, perhaps with good reason, do not always enjoy having the Roma as their neighbours. These are the uncomfortable facts that the majority of citizens and people think and that certain do-gooders do not have the courage to admit, because, the truth is, sometimes you also have to have the political courage to say ...

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am very pleased that you are the guardian of the treaties. In actual fact, the Commission also guards the Commission’s own secrets so well that it is very difficult for us MEPs, for example, to obtain extensive and, above all, in-depth information about what takes place behind closed doors in your meetings, despite the fact that the Commissioners have not been elected by our peoples and should therefore feel all the more bound to observe their duty of communication and transparency. For example, I am still waiting for an answer – and not the ironic answer I have been given – to my question so that I can circulate the truth in the newspapers. Is or was President Barroso a member of the Bilderberg Club or not? Does he frequent it or not? The answer I was given, and which I published in my press releases, in other words, was as follows: ‘Mr Borghezio, you know more than us about the Bilderberg Group’ is a little odd, and I would therefore like more information on the subject. For example, what information has the international press given on the background to the financial crisis? The Lisbon strategy was quoted; that is very interesting. It is like looking at a set of Chinese boxes when you come to establish the true owners of the large financial groups to which the leading newspapers and mass media belong; they could be based in tax havens for all we know. I believe that you would do very well to champion an initiative aimed at really disclosing what goes on behind the scenes of politics, finance and the economy. These are very interesting subjects and have widespread relevance to citizens, who have a right to be kept fully informed. I note, and would emphasise, the silence of the left wing with regard to the Bilderberg Club and the Trilateral Commission. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the measures for the supervision of the European financial system must – and this should be better emphasised in the report – have a priority objective, which must be very clear and strongly supported: to establish strict rules to control the derivatives market as this is one of the main causes, if not the main cause, of the current financial crisis. Here, instead, we are, above all, designing a centralised institution, to some extent copied from the model of the ECB. This is not good, because at this point it is not known or fully clear what the role of the national supervisory bodies will be – the Banca d'Italia
 in our country. It seems that they are being watered down somewhat to the role of agent, which is not a particularly well-defined role. Instead, oversight should begin in our countries. In Italy, for example, it happens via a system of local branches which can monitor situations well. Furthermore, why should the headquarters of the European agency be in Frankfurt? Who decided that? Based on what criteria, if not in order – I would say – to make it conformant with the European Central Bank? We propose it be sited in Milan, for example, which is a major financial and banking market, including from a geo-economic point of view due to its position at the centre of Europe. I believe that this plan should generally go much deeper, with measures that require courage to implement, such as introducing a separation between commercial and investment banks in European legislation, based on the principles of the old US law.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, while we are discussing these various issues, there is a lively debate under way in the United States on what I consider to be a crucial question, namely, a return to the principles of the Glass-Steagall Act and the separation of ordinary banks from the speculating banks that caused the extremely serious problems for which our economies and peoples are paying a heavy price. While solutions are being put to us here, 10 days ago, behind closed doors in the secrecy of the Bilderberg Club meetings, a large number of senior bureaucrats and European political leaders came together, probably to lay down instructions for the directives that will subsequently be presented to the European Parliament, which will have no other choice but to consider them. Moreover, this morning I heard Mr Barroso’s appeal to provide aid to our Greek friends. I would not want the aid mainly going to his friend, the shipowner Spiros Latsis. There is a clear conflict of interest here for Mr Barroso, who should account for this. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how long will the euro last in its current form? Are we perhaps headed towards its destructuring within a year or two? I do not agree with creating a new supplementary deficit of EUR 750 billion to cover an earlier one or that these measures are sufficient for building the socio-economic future of 500 million Europeans, nor do I agree with the dogma of saving the euro as it is, because it should be done by keeping the euro as low as possible and reducing the interest rate to inject capital into productive investments for our industries, which are gasping for air, rather than into public financing. I do not agree with the European Commission expecting to review and audit the accounting of Member States’ budgets before the national parliaments: farewell to sovereignty. I disagree with an economic and financial strategy that fails to contemplate specific needs. Mario Borghezio  (EFD

 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, an industrial policy that focuses exclusively on companies operating internationally and using advanced technologies is not the best route to success. We must not forget the whole small and medium enterprise sector, including both small-scale manufacturers and retailers. Innovation policy should be aimed at them also. In particular, this strategy should guarantee conditions that place small and medium-sized enterprises on an equal footing with their competitors outside the EU by adopting safeguard clauses and strong, effective measures to combat the extremely serious problem of counterfeiting, including through effective trade defence instruments. It is important that governance of the Europe 2020 strategy should not rest in the hands of the Commission alone, but should be carried out at different levels, including the national and macro-regional levels. We need to start formulating a policy and strategy that focus on the local level and the reality of manufacturing on the ground, and I would like to stress here the need for attention to be paid to the manufacturing situation in Padania. In other words, we are asking for more attention to be paid to the actual manufacturing situation on the ground, focusing, in particular, on the SME structure, as I said, which is the backbone of manufacturing in every country in Europe and is therefore where the real hope for the future of manufacturing and development of the European Union lies.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that we are here discussing and examining the content of this Europe 2020 strategy, while in Athens workers are dying, and a country, a nation is on the edge of a precipice, paints a rather telling, or, I would go so far as to say, grotesque, picture of European politics. It is absolutely remarkable that in a situation of this kind, the Commission does not feel that it should take a good, long look at itself, because it is not as though it does not realise that this crisis, which in some respects has now reached, I would say, dramatic proportions, is a consequence of many serious mistakes, as demonstrated by the failure of the Lisbon strategy. Many mistakes and one defendant in the dock: the euro. You come here saying, in all your statements, that Greece is a one-off, but will you be saying that when – although let us hope not – another similar situation arises, for example in Spain: will that be another one-off? We here are a bit tired of hearing the one-off excuse: the subprime crisis was also a one-off. It is hard to believe and very difficult to accept what the Commission is saying when the European Union has not yet decided to clean up Europe’s banks and to tell savers, manufacturers and the real economy how much muck there still is in European banks, in order to develop a strategy. We must keep these points in mind and remember that a serious strategy must be based on the real economy, on the small and medium-sized enterprise system, and naturally it must give a responsible role to workers, through their participation, too.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, procedure is one thing: we delegate choices regarding trade policy to the Commission, and that is only right. However, the substance of the matter is something else. What we, the group of the Northern League, representing the regions of Northern Italy, are worried about are the decisions on trade, the progressive reduction of duties, the lack of any industrial policy, and concession of advantages to multinationals. In other words, it is acceptable that Parliament should delegate decisions to the Commission at a technical level, but it is not a good thing that we are slaves and victims of the outdated economic and industrial policy of the World Trade Organisation, which favours the large foreign powers, making no effort to defend our manufacturers. I am not sure if you are aware of the number of small and medium-sized enterprises that are closing in Lombardy and Veneto due to trade agreements that offer no protection to our products. It would be a mistake to believe that research and innovation alone will take us very far. There is a real risk that we will become like the countries of Eastern or Northern Europe, the United States or Asia, where all of the shopping malls now belong to the large multinationals. Therefore, as Parliament, we should delegate the power to adopt these acts regarding trade policy to the Commission, in the hope, however, that the Commission will revise, modernise and defend a manufacturing and trade system that will otherwise disappear.

 With all due respect for your work and that of others, I invite you to come and see for yourself the extent to which agreements with the World Trade Organisation have a positive or negative effect on enterprises in Northern Italy. In half an hour we will be speaking about the Chinese photovoltaic industry. I think that Europe, as it is structured today, counts for little or nothing. I do not know whether the individual states would count for more. What I do know is that the trade policy pursued in this regard by the European Commission is a complete failure for our enterprises. A completely free market is of no use to anyone. Matteo Salvini,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I feel ashamed. While enterprises are closing and workers being made redundant, you come here and tell us we are the most open market in the world and that this investigation will issue its findings in nine months. Somebody here seems to have forgotten why he is being paid a salary by the European taxpayers. If Mr De Gucht says that the trade war is not China’s fault, that is nonetheless an indication that someone has declared war. We can hardly argue with the fact that many enterprises are closing and laying off their workers, or is this not the case in Brussels? Instead of MEPs, I would like to see here today those workers who have lost their jobs and those businesspeople who have seen 30 or 40 or 50 years of work go up smoke for reasons that are obvious to us all. Does anyone here really doubt that China engages in unfair trade, exploits workers, illegally subsidises its enterprises and ignores environmental issues? Does anyone have any questions that cannot be resolved in nine days rather than nine months? I am ashamed to represent a Europe that by the end of this investigation will have no photovoltaic industry left. For some people, the words ‘import duty’ are taboo. Well then certain people should either impose import duties to get things done, or otherwise resign, because nine months is too long to spend investigating the obvious. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

The issues that, to my mind, require further attention are identification of the scope of the proposal for a regulation to remove some inconsistencies and reflect the categories of manufacture, make the timetable for application simple and clear to prevent problems for manufacturers with having to introduce the new features required by the regulation too quickly, and introduction of environmental requirements that manufacturers do not find it excessively difficult to comply with.

 I decided to vote in favour of this measure because it updates the rules on the type-approval of agricultural and forestry vehicles with a view to ensuring the functioning of the internal market, while at the same time providing for a high level of environmental protection and road safety. One aspect worthy of mention is access to vehicle repair and maintenance information. The justifiable need to provide information for the repair of vehicles has been balanced by the need to protect information valuable to competitors, especially in Asia, who want to copy the best technical solutions in the sector.

 I voted in favour of this report. It is, of course, a text that has undergone only slight amendments and that could be seen merely as an alignment to existing legislation. However, I would like to explain the political importance of this little vote. We should be close to Serbia and be helping its development and growth. I am generally sceptical about this kind of agreement with other countries, but encouraging interchange between the EU and Serbia could prove an important opportunity for both sides.

 I obviously voted in favour of this report. It is a good sign that the European Commission has reached an agreement of this kind, although Moldova is certainly no threat to our geographical indications. We expect efforts to achieve recognition of our products of excellence to be stepped up with other third countries such as the USA and Australia. This should be our objective, though I doubt that Commissioner De Gucht has either the will or the ability to pursue it. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I hardly need to say that the single market has certainly benefited citizens and businesses. For this reason I voted in favour. The problem, however, is that, unlike our competitors such as the US, the trade policy pursued by the European Commission with third countries does not put us in a position to protect our interests. Similarly, the single market cannot be invoked as the solution to every problem in Europe. Often it is actually poorly conceived directives, like the Services Directive, that give our workers and businesses enormous problems. Bring on the single market, but let it not be an instrument designed solely around the needs of multinationals. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted against this proposal and I am pleased that there was a majority of MEPs who shared my position. The relevant committee for this matter asked the Council to present a female candidate and, having been ignored, reacted negatively to the recommendation to appoint Yves Mersch as a Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB). I do not have sufficient information to say whether Mr Mersch deserves this post or not, but I cannot fail to take into consideration the fact that appointing a man would mean that there would be no women on the ECB’s Executive Board until 2018. I am also very sceptical of the procedure used. It is degrading for Parliament merely to have to ratify decisions made elsewhere. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted in favour of this provision. Some European Court of Justice rulings and the strict rules imposed by the World Trade Organisation severely restrict our freedom to legislate to protect European industry and workers against counterfeit goods and goods produced without respect for social and environmental standards. For this reason I hope that the European institutions’ agenda of work on this sensitive subject will no longer be controlled by the rulings or dictates of globalisation, but by a serious trade and industrial policy.

 I voted against this resolution, despite the fact that the Committee on International Trade has produced an interesting text that picks up on many of the most important issues in relations between the EU and Japan.

My opposition to an agreement that removes tariffs between Europe and Japan is total and unconditional. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has been awarded a Nobel Prize, no less! If only its citizens could hear some of the speeches made in this Parliament. Where is all this dialogue, this respect for human rights and tolerance? I hope that the Commission presses ahead with its project that from a technical, economic and social point of view is useful for dialogue, useful to consumers, useful to enterprises and useful to workers in Israel, be they Jews, Christians or Muslims. Israel has provided us with a model to strive for and to compete with in terms of pharmaceutical research, The sad thing is that we do not hear the same kind of indignation in this House from hypocritical left-wing parties when human rights are ignored in other parts of the world, in North Africa, in the Middle East. You can continue this Israel-Palestine derby all you like, but nobody will ever win it. I hope that this agreement will be a small contribution to peace in the area. I think that anyone who votes against the proposal should be ashamed of themselves. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted in favour of the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2008/106/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum level of training of seafarers. The proposed amendments aim to ensure improved standards for issuance and recognition of certificates of maritime training issued by states that are parties to the Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention), new criteria for determining medical fitness of crews and stricter measures to prevent fraudulent practices. The proposal also addresses recognition of seafarers’ certificates by the European Maritime Safety Agency, extending the deadline for the procedure of recognition of third countries’ STCW systems from three to 18 months.

 I voted in favour of the recommendation on the draft Council Decision on the conclusion of a Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the State of Israel, of the other part, on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products. Under this agreement some of the benefits of the internal market would be extended to aligned sectors and facilitate access to the Israeli market, removing technical barriers to trade for industrial products. The Protocol will allow EU exporters, if they so choose, to test and certify their industrial products subject to the same aligned requirements and standards, and then to have access to the Israeli market without having to comply with any further conformity assessment certification procedure.

I voted in favour of the report on trade relations with the United States by Mr Moreira. The US is undoubtedly an important trading partner for Italy and Italian exporters, although I urge the European Commission to make greater efforts to protect Italian interests on the question of indications of origin. I therefore particularly welcome the report’s emphasis on the need to resolve this issue. Other important questions are also dealt with, such as removal of trade barriers, the introduction of measures to ensure better market access, including for investment, the protection of intellectual property rights, the opening up of public procurement markets to ensure full reciprocity and convergence on mutual recognition of regulatory standards.

 I decided to vote against the report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council introducing emergency autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan because I think, frankly, that it is absurd. I cannot understand the need to come up with such a complex and laborious regulation because, in just a few years’ time and without any great upheaval, Pakistan will benefit from the trade preferences established in the recent reform of the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+) system, which I voted against. Moreover, this regulation provides for the total elimination of customs for a list of 75 tariff lines that relate almost exclusively to the textile sector, which will have a devastating impact on the industrial make-up of northern Italy.

 I supported the legislative proposal on European standardisation tabled by Lara Comi as it set itself the important goal of amending a whole series of guidelines in a technical field, standardisation, that is of great importance for the business world. Following this measure, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will be directly involved in developing new standards owing to the lower access rates. In addition, in the process of drawing up standards, there is also room for consumers through their associations. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I decided to vote against the report on the amended proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards electronic identification of bovine animals and deleting the provisions on voluntary beef labelling. In fact, I believe it is wrong to abolish the labelling system, which is optional, blaming administrative burdens that each farmer can optionally decide whether or not they wish to incur. On the contrary, such a labelling system has proved to be effective, enabling consumers to make informed choices regarding their purchases, by ensuring that additional information is provided in a harmonised and certified manner. Its abolition would favour less transparent producers. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted in favour of Mr Susta’s report. These openings by Russia, even if due to its imminent accession to the World Trade Organisation, are clearly good news.

 This agreement with Russia is positive and I wholeheartedly voted in favour. I hope, though, that these events help the Commission understand that the Union must consider providing at least the same level of protection for its own industrial system as our international partners do. This agreement is positive, but it does not resolve the difficulties that our companies in the sector have faced and are still facing in order to be able to continue production in Europe. The Commission must listen to their needs and safeguard jobs in the 27 Member States of the Union. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 Raw materials are one of the most sensitive issues. It is a good thing for the EU to negotiate with Russia, one of the largest holders of natural raw materials, in order to guarantee vital procurement for our industry.

 I voted against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). One of those most responsible for this blow to the Union’s credibility is Commissioner De Gucht. I believe that, instead of insisting on this agreement, he should have resigned. On several occasions, Parliament asked to have the issue of geographical indications included in ACTA, but Commissioner De Gucht was not able to negotiate this with his counterparts. The doubts over the infringement of fundamental rights are too serious to approve such an agreement. The fight against counterfeiting deserves bespoke measures and above all the involvement of those countries, particularly Asian countries, which bear the most responsibility for this huge disaster for our businesses.

I voted for the report by Mr Creutzmann. I believe that it is necessary for the customs checks system to be equipped with rules that are up to date with the current situation and new problems. Combating counterfeiting is an extremely important element for the protection and promotion of employment, creativity and consumer protection in Europe. In my view, the many amendments tabled by the left, seeking to reduce the rigour necessary for a customs system that will protect our economy, were very negative. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted firmly for this report. European car manufacturers claim they are ready to take on the challenge of incorporating this type of equipment in the vehicles they produce. This will have the result of saving human lives. However, I should not like the European Parliament to go too far, perhaps by proposing to extend eCall to other types of vehicle too rapidly. In current circumstances, that would amount to excessive costs for manufacturers and would probably not have the effect of improving road safety. As regards ordinary cars, I remain in favour, and I hope that these devices will soon be launched on the market. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 Mr Ransdorf’s report seems balanced. This is why I have voted in favour.

Europe can do much in this regard. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as usual, I fear that someone is wasting your time and trying to hoodwink citizens, entrepreneurs and Internet users in Europe, in Italy and, as far as I am concerned, in Padania. We are debating an agreement involving just a handful of countries, one that excludes 95% of countries engaged in exporting counterfeit goods, so effectively it is much ado about nothing. The Commissioner talks about defending businesses and jobs, and then goes and signs free trade agreements with Morocco, Korea, Pakistan and India. We remove tariffs, barriers and protections to help banks, insurance companies and multinationals from Northern Europe, and then try to muzzle the web by selling it as a way of defending our businesses. No one is falling for it any more, Commissioner. Go and inspect the ports in northern Europe, the port of Rotterdam for example, if you want to fight counterfeiting; do not try and gag anyone. If you really want to do something tangible about it, take the first plane to China, India or Indonesia and bring home something tangible, or else resign. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted in favour of this report. This is a big step forward in protecting people with coeliac disease. The Commission’s proposal has been improved by the Members’ amendments, especially those by Italian Members. There is profound ignorance about coeliac disease in various Member States: it is neither a fad, nor an allergy. Coeliac disease is an illness and the words ‘gluten free’ on food products cannot be trivialised as a simple claim or allergen. Coeliacs cannot eat any gluten whatsoever. It will be important if the excellent rapporteur is able to defend the improvements made to the text and oppose any deleterious proposals made by the Council. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 The motion for a resolution, which is the result of the work carried out by the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, is very interesting and contains references which I believe will be useful in helping the Commission understand possible future single market scenarios. However I voted against the resolution because I believe there are premises in the text that are wrong. Rating the single market too highly as a solution to the crisis or claiming that its completion would automatically lead to growth throughout the Union means saying things that are not true. Our companies need the single market, but the reasons for the crisis are to be found elsewhere and are much more deep-seated and serious. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted against Mr Fjellner’s report, even though the Commission’s proposal is, without doubt, an improvement on the previous scheme of generalised tariff preferences, and despite the fact that the Council introduced a number of additional restrictions for the GSP+ scheme during negotiations with Parliament. Unfortunately, however, a country such as Pakistan – a serious threat to EU textile businesses, which continue to hold strong – would soon be able to benefit from the GSP+ scheme. I do not think that is a good thing. We ought to have further limited access to these trade preferences. That is why Lega Nord

 I voted in favour of this resolution. Parliament must be able to influence the mandate it will receive from the Commission to negotiate with Japan.

 The resolution on the trade agreement with Colombia and Peru poses some serious questions. Can the Commission continue to make concessions to countries that blatantly violate human rights?

 I obviously voted in favour of the report. On the very day of the terrible events that affected Liguria and Tuscany a few months ago, I submitted an urgent question to the European Commission to draw attention to the tragedy, occurring, in particular, in Genoa, the Cinque Terre region and neighbouring areas. I voted with the moving images of the altruistic spirit of the ‘Angels of the Mud’ who helped the affected populations still fresh in my mind, and with the memory of my sorrow for those who, in those dreadful days, lost their lives or a loved one still vivid.

 The mobilisation of funds to help the regions affected by the tragic events in Liguria is a necessity. The European Union Solidarity Fund is a very important instrument that brings Europeans much closer together than many political or legislative initiatives. When casting my vote in favour, my thoughts turned to those people who were bereaved and lost everything in the floods. Given that these events are happening more and more frequently, I think that the time has come, in collaboration with the European Commission, to establish a programme to identify suitable instruments with which to invest in innovation and prevention in Europe.

 I voted in favour of the report. I think it is right that at last we have a general legislative instrument valid for any future macro-financial assistance for third countries. I supported the main proposals made by the rapporteur, even though I did not share his concern regarding the need to involve our Parliament more fully in future measures of macro-financial assistance. In my opinion, the procedure initially proposed by the European Commission, which provided for the involvement of the Council but not of the European Parliament could have been maintained. However, the members of the Committee on International Trade preferred to bring in changes that will make negotiations with the Council very long and difficult to resolve. I express my hope, in any case, that the rapporteur will be successful in the negotiations with the colegislator. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted for the report and I congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work. The problems that China creates for our production system are well known: for many years now, my political movement, Lega Nord
, has been expressing its concern over the relocation of our enterprises to Asia, the social dumping that adversely affects our workers, and the risks associated with the arrival on our territory of products that are dangerous and do not comply with our rules. For these reasons, it is right that the European Commission should make a serious, concrete commitment to demanding reciprocity and setting in motion a genuine strategy to protect our production system and revitalise a genuine industrial policy.

 I want to vote against this measure and I would like to explain the political reasons that led me to make this decision. We need to give a signal to the European Commission so that it will represent us effectively at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Yet another European defeat in a dispute with China at the WTO would today force Parliament to delete an article in our Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation. It is wrong not to stand up more strongly to international bodies like the WTO. It is wrong not to defend our industry. It is wrong not to ask China for reciprocal openings for our products and services. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 My vote in favour of this measure is not just a duty. In actual fact, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules require the European Union to remove the rules imposing restrictions on the import of products from other members of the WTO. Since Russia has now become a member of the WTO, unless we had voted to repeal certain rules today, we would have been subject to certain sanctions which would have damaged our production and our businesses.

 I voted with absolute conviction against this report. I understand Mr Rinaldi’s position, but I do not share his enthusiastically positive stance on the outcomes of the so-called Arab Spring. I do not agree on his call for the creation of a free trade area with the countries of North Africa, which would seriously damage our textiles industry and agriculture, which have already been hampered by an unprecedented crisis. Lastly, I do not approve of the general tone of the report, which focuses exclusively on protecting and promoting the interests of the other party, while completely forgetting to refer to and defend legitimate EU trading interests. It seems more like a report by the Committee on Development than one by the Committee on International Trade. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I voted in favour of this agreement, as I did for the similar measure relating to Liberia. However, I remain doubtful about the actual possibility of its implementation by the Central African Republic. The European Commission will be responsible for monitoring in order to ensure that the forestry heritage of this country does not suffer irreversible damage and that a stop is put to illegal logging, a real scourge afflicting the entire African continent. In any case, my vote in favour was also meant as a vote of faith in the two parties to the agreement.

 I voted in favour of these amendments to the European Fisheries Fund. The measure will involve no cost to the EU because the funds advanced to Member States in economic difficulties will be offset before the end of the programme.

 I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for her success in proposing numerous amendments within the Committee on International Trade to a proposal from the Commission that contained some highly unacceptable passages such as the extension of time limits for reaching the decision to introduce trade duties. These actions are necessary in order to safeguard our production system and therefore require speed, not more bureaucracy or time-wasting.

 I voted in favour of this resolution because it is always necessary to underline the fact that trade with our international partners must always take place in a context of respect for human rights.

The references to respect for the principle of subsidiarity are quite correct, as – even more so – are the references to the major interests that see the Mafia and organised crime in general involved in waste disposal, especially in some regions. Everyone is monitoring the situation in Campania, but we must also underline that in Italy – especially in northern regions around the Po, but also in some cases in the South – there are instances of excellent management of the waste cycle, which can set an example for the whole of Europe. In order to achieve these results, it is very important that local citizens improve their selection of local politicians. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 As I already mentioned in yesterday’s debate, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Cutaș. However, I demand that the European Commission should act on this important vote and quickly exert all necessary pressure on the government of Uzbekistan to put paid to the use of children in the cotton harvest. Europe cannot enter into agreements with countries that act in such a way. Cotton is a very important raw material for the textiles industry in my Padania.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we will support this report and we thank the rapporteur for his work. I am the seventh or eighth person to take the floor to say the same thing. If the Commission really believes that what we debate in Parliament counts for something, it should take action tomorrow, not with a report, or a threat, or a proposal for a measure. If it is true, and here the whole House is saying the same thing, from left to right – that thousands of children are forcibly sent to work in the cotton fields (and I think that the evidence now proves that it is so), then we vote in favour of this report. Yet if, tomorrow morning, no practical action against the government of Uzbekistan is taken by the European Commission, it will mean that we have lost, and we have wasted our time here tonight, as well as helping to destroy the credibility of Parliament, the Commission and the European institutions, and that we have several hundred thousand children on our consciences. Children who, if the debate continues so slowly, will continue next year to do what they have been forced to do for decades. Therefore, we support this report. However, I hope that at eight, when the debate ends, and with tomorrow’s vote, the problem will not be shelved, and I hope that the Commission will act, today rather than tomorrow.

 I voted for this report. The rapporteur, Mr Sturdy, and the Committee on International Trade (INTA) have done excellent work. In any case, it is right to emphasise that certain states may raise barriers to legitimately protect their own economy and their own consumers. Of course, the text is lacking one important consideration which is that at some point, even the European Union might need to start protecting its own fabric of production rather than limiting itself to only requesting reductions in duties and the removal of non-tariff barriers. In my opinion, a real trade policy should not limit itself to this alone and should consider the interests of European small and medium-sized enterprises first and foremost. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

 I would like to explain my vote in favour of the report on the modernisation of customs, because this is an important and much-needed text that enables the Commission to postpone the entry into force of a regulation adopted in 2008 and slated for implementation in 2013. Our delegation would have preferred to purge the text of references to the non-preferential origin principle, which we do not support, has nothing to do with the text of the report, and which we will fight if it is put forward again during the debate on the legislative proposal.

 I would like to declare my vote in favour of Ms McClarkin’s report on the implementation of the Professional Qualifications Directive. There is no doubt that the ability to carry out one’s profession in all Member States is a significant feature of the internal market. It is important to implement the quite correct precautions outlined in the report in regard to the health care sector, third-country professional qualifications and the need for a high level of linguistic competence, particularly for some professional categories whose work involves being in close contact with patients or clients.

 The purpose of this text is to provide a right and necessary basis for guiding the Commission on consumer protection. It is a complex and important issue that thus requires further consideration in the future. The report has brought to light important principles such as the importance of the consumer’s role in developing EU policies and the dissatisfaction being shown by citizens, with increasing concerns over sectors such as finance and insurance. Mr Triantaphyllides’ report also includes important points on the need to bolster consumer protection in sectors which are currently growing quickly, such as e-commerce.

 I would like to express my vote in favour of Mr Creutzmann’s report. The online gambling market is in a state of continual growth and its turnover has now exceeded EUR 10 billion. For these reasons, the issue of protecting consumers, specifically those who are weaker and more at risk, is extremely delicate and important. At the same time, we must ensure that the revenue generated for Member States through taxation of online gambling is not curtailed by the worrying presence of illegal gambling games which, other than providing an opportunity to launder enormous sums of illegally obtained money, place less cautious consumers in grave danger. I believe that it is of fundamental importance to ensure that national regulators work in close collaboration with each other. Greater exchange of information across Europe could prevent cases whereby unregulated providers exploit regulatory gaps and play national regulatory bodies off against each other. For this reason, the Commission and the Member States should take immediate steps to protect European consumers from bogus providers. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for having made such a complex subject and report accessible to everyone. I welcome the document, as it invites the Commission to simplify and safeguard the different legal practices in the various Member States, as well as the refusal to introduce new rules for tenders below European thresholds. Furthermore, the report dedicates a lot of space to the protection of small and medium-sized enterprises in respect of their ability to access European contract tenders. Finally, I would like to underline that simplifying legislative procedures not only offers many advantages to local administrators; it also helps to eradicate the wasting of funds. I therefore invite the Commission to continue along this route towards improving legal clarity. Matteo Salvini  (EFD

I would like to explain my strong opposition to this report, not just for the specific topic discussed in the text – the mutual evaluation tool, in relation to which, despite the delays and inconsistencies, it is possible to discern some positive aspects – but to the Commission’s attitude to such a complex issue. Unfortunately, in fact, the report only examines a marginal part of the Services Directive that is of little importance. Meanwhile, it fails to address the serious problems that the directive is causing, such as the lack of consumer protection, the little autonomy left to local authorities, and the calling into question of small manufacturing operations on which entire families have depended for generations.

I should also like to compliment the rapporteur, Mr Iacolino, for the thoroughness of this text, which not only brings in greater controls on illicit arms trafficking, but also simplifies trade in these weapons for some categories, such as hunters and sport shooters.

I feel duty-bound to vote in favour of renewing trade preferences with Balkan countries, including Serbia, that currently have a stabilisation and association agreement in place with the European Union. Firstly, I feel this way on the basis of the Commission’s favourable take on simplifying commercial agreements with countries, such as China, that do not have association agreements with the European Union and whose products often undermine our competitiveness. Secondly, the text on which we reached final agreement offers the possibility of limiting the damage that allowing access for these goods could cause to our market. Matteo Salvini,  
on behalf of the EFD Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a snapshot of a disaster: it talks about a strategy for Europe, but we see no strategy. It is a snapshot of a hopeless disaster. Thank you for the report, which offers no way out at all. Somebody will have to explain to me what the Commission’s farsightedness entails. The details put forward here actually portray a debacle of what Europe is not. The prevailing interests are those of certain Northern European countries that want to liberalise everything and trade, regardless of social dumping and the imbalances we have with our so-called partners, but without any interest or protection for our small and medium-sized enterprises. It is essentially British and German interests that are being defended both by the Commission and by the report. I smile when I see in the report that the Member States and the Commission are being urged to communicate better, since the people of the European Union are sick to death of globalisation because of the loss of productivity. If, in your view, we can solve things by communicating better, then we really have not understood where to go.
