 Mr President, Ms Reding, ladies and gentlemen, a secure supply of sugar for the European market must be the top priority of European sugar policy. The reform of the sugar regime in 2006 made the European Union dependent on imports, at least in part. Ms Reding has just mentioned the figures. The result of the reform is that imports amounting to 15% of consumption are now needed on a permanent basis. However, after the imports fell below expected levels because of poor harvests in some important sugar producing countries and the resulting rise in world market prices, the Commission has, in my opinion, taken the right measures. It has made importing additional amounts of sugar easier. More than 500 000 tonnes have been imported without duty being paid. It has also enabled domestic producers of sugar and isoglucose to sell part of their non-quota production on the food market. The amount in this case is also 500 000 tonnes. Against this background, it is clear that the Commission has achieved the balance referred to in the questions. I very much support what Ms Reding has said in this respect. The sugar market regime has the necessary instruments to secure the supply and to guarantee a fair balance across the different interests. The risk of redundancies has been mentioned, in particular, by the first speaker, and I would like to refer to what Mr Tarabella said. Thousands of jobs were lost during the reform of the sugar regime. In my constituency in the Upper Palatinate area of Germany, one of the oldest sugar refineries in Europe was closed with the loss of hundreds of jobs. Our goal must not be to ensure that every single job is secure, despite the fact that I regret every redundancy. Instead, we must ensure that there is a balance. I believe it will be good for the sugar regime reform to be extended until 2020. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Albert Deß  (PPE

Thank you, Ms Ludford. In the past, we had excessively high sugar prices in Europe. During the reform of the sugar regime in 2006 and also beforehand, sugar beet prices in Europe fell by around 40%. This meant that sugar beet producers suffered massive cuts. There have been major fluctuations in prices on the world market. There was a time when sugar was much more expensive on the world market than in Germany. At that point, none of the African, Caribbean and Pacific states were supplying Europe. The problem was that there were inconsistencies. Ms Ludford, if we in Europe abolish the sugar regime, we will be even more exposed to fluctuations in prices and European consumers will have to pay a bitter price. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, as one of the few people in this Chamber to have actually been a lorry driver myself, I voted against this today, even though Mr Higgins has done some good work. There were two main reasons for this. Firstly, it was because Parliament voted in favour of Amendment 134, which lowered the tonnage limit of the vehicles from 3.5 tonnes to 2.8 tonnes. I consider that excessive; it was not necessary. Above all, in the end I voted against the motion because Amendment 129 was rejected. This amendment called for the radius for approved exemptions to be extended to 150 kilometres. I am from the Upper Palatinate. Munich is 130 kilometres away. My tradesmen work in Munich a great deal, and now they have to install tachographs because they work in Munich. I am particularly annoyed that the only other Member from the Upper Palatinate region, Ismail Ertug, voted against the interests of tradesmen in our region on these two points. I have great hopes that this will be corrected again at second reading, so that tradesmen who work in areas some distance away from their own will not be disadvantaged. Albert Deß  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner Dalli, I am very pleased that you are here because I know that you are always sympathetic to our concerns. It is very good that you should be made aware of the problems of milk producers. Opinions differ on the milk quota, even within my own group. I often find myself in agreement with my colleague from Luxembourg, Ms Lulling, however we differ on this point. We, the nine representatives of the German conservative group (CSU) from the last electoral term, already voted en bloc against increasing the quota in 2008. The esteemed Commissioner at the time, Ms Fischer Boel, understood the term ‘soft landing’ to mean an increasing of the quota. Increasing the quota means more volume and more volume means lower prices. This is a fairly simple formula. This is precisely the problem we are faced with at present because there are farmers in the European Union who are delivering too much quota, causing a distortion in the milk market. I am against reducing the super levy or increasing the quota even further, because dairy farmers also need some contractual security. The quota will be phased out on 31 March 2015 and we need contractual security by then. We also need other important systems, Mr Dalli: fixed payment deadlines, net-net prices and binding supply volumes. These are the key points we need to work on in order to prepare for a market without quotas. Albert Deß  (PPE
),  
Blue-card question.

 Mr Ferreira, I have just one brief supplementary question: Did you know that in 2008, when the Council discussed increasing the quota, Portugal also voted in favour of this expansion and that only two countries were against increasing the quota, namely Germany and Austria? France abstained from voting. Twenty-four countries, including Portugal, voted to increase the quota, thereby undermining the quota system. Albert Deß  (PPE
).

Mr President, thank you; I asked to speak because we still have some time left. I will be brief. I would like everyone who talks about the absolute freedom of the milk market, whether from my own group or from other groups, to take the following to heart: from 2015 onwards we shall also have to discontinue the historical payments per hectare. We cannot have a situation where milk producers in Latvia receive EUR 100 per hectare, while producers in other countries receive over EUR 1 000 on the basis of historical premiums. This does not constitute fair competition. A milk producer who receives compensation payments of EUR 1 000 per hectare can sell his milk to the market at a lower price, thus distorting the market. That cannot be allowed to happen. Starting from 2015, we must pay the same hectare premiums for all milk producers in the first pillar. We can expect some interesting discussions. My second comment relates to the market: we need to strengthen the position of producers and processors in relation to the retail sector. I fully support this. We cannot have a situation where milk producers and processors have to pay premiums and listing discounts and payments are delayed by periods of up to 100 days. Commissioner Dalli, we need to step in here to strengthen the position of producers and dairy farmers as a whole. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Albert Deß  (PPE

 Thank you for your question, Mr Bové. I myself am the president of a large dairy cooperative that markets milk for 7 000 dairy farmers and only the dairy farmers themselves have a say in the business, in other words the directors and the members of the supervisory board are all farmers. Unfortunately, we do not have enough leverage in the market to impose our prices on these wholesale chains. What we find particularly disturbing, and what causes prices to drop, are the unfair methods employed by others. There are no net-net prices. Discounts have to be given at the end of the year. Listing fees are demanded in the interim. In other words, it is impossible to compare the prices paid by the retailers because they are undermined by these systems. The Commission should look for clear-cut systems that would make the whole system more transparent and easier to understand. This would also allow us to protect our own interests more effectively.

Mr President, I believe that the present problem is not that we do not have enough milk, but rather that we have too much. The problem is that some farmers are supplying much more than their quota permits. The aim of Ms Lulling and a number of other colleagues is to abolish or reduce the super levy. I disagree with them on this. This provision lasts up to 2015 and a number of dairy producers have spent money in recent months in order to purchase quotas. These people would be penalised if we were now to do away with the entire system. We must provide contractual security. Contractual security means that the status quo must be maintained until 2015, in other words that any force the quota may still have should remain in place until then. We need to consider what market measures we take after 2015. I must say that my dairy cooperative of 7 000 farmers is preparing well for 1 April 2015 and I have also advised dairy farmers to do likewise. Albert Deß  (PPE

Mr President, the subject of compensation payments that we are debating today is a very important one for our farmers in the areas concerned. I would like to point out here that the compensation payments are a success story in European agricultural policy. They have helped the management of the land to continue throughout these areas, where the biodiversity of the cultural landscape has been safeguarded and the jobs of people in these areas have been retained. This has meant that people in these areas continue to have prospects. I therefore find the way that the Commission as well as the Council have dealt with this sensitive matter even more incomprehensible. If we consider these eight biophysical criteria, we see that we will gain new inequities that are significantly worse than those under the current system, in which there are a few delimitation problems. We would have a system that would probably cause a great deal of anger. Details have leaked from Germany indicating that 2.8 million hectares would be removed and 1.2 million new hectares would be included in their place. When I speak to farmers from these areas, they are surprised that they should suddenly be in a Less-Favoured Area. From France, we hear that an area where farmers have the highest average income is to become a less-favoured area. This just does not add up. I would ask the Council whether it is prepared to work with Parliament in the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon so that we can draw up better proposals. Sometimes all I can say, with a certain amount of irony, is: I think as Parliament we need to make a few copies of the Treaty of Lisbon available to the Council and the Commission so that they finally catch on in all areas that this Treaty exists. It appears that many of them are not yet aware of this. Since the whole business really does already resemble a comedy show, as Mr Jahr put it, I would like to make another suggestion. We should declare the area in which the Commission and the Council meet to be a Less-Favoured Area, because they are withholding more than 66% of the information from us. Albert Deß,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to Ms Corazza Bildt and the other Member for the fact that this subject is on the agenda. Not everything is certain, but a hundred years ago we had almost exclusively local production, and products were brought to market in their local area. Today, the situation is quite different. I have here an interesting announcement from the German Federal Ministry of Agriculture, which has discussed precisely what the Commissioner was just saying, namely that it is already possible to entertain regional showcases and regional origin. According to the statement, the Federal Minister for the Economy Ilse Aigner is looking to launch regional labelling in Germany at a Federal/Länder
 summit in April. She says that she is now going to bring forward an initial plan for a new regional showcase for food packaging. The aim would be to put in place clear and transparent labelling for regional products. The labelling is to be voluntary initially, and will aim to make the origin of the product and the most important ingredients transparent. The results of a survey are also interesting. Seventy-nine per cent of consumers are prepared to pay more for regional foods, but only 17% feel reliably informed about the origin of regional foods. Herein lies the major problem, therefore. According to one survey, 83% of respondents in Germany already pay attention to which region a foodstuff comes from. There then follows an interesting statement: according to the Minister, there is no requirement either for a new national legal basis or for notification via the Commission in order to for such a regional showcase to be introduced. In other words, the Member States already have the latitude to act in this way. Nonetheless, the Commission needs to provide greater clarity in this area. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Thank you for your question, Mr Jahr. The reality, Commissioner, is that the Commission, too, needs to consider whether we do not need to lay down other criteria. I had an experience a few years ago, where I had to fight in the Commission in order to help a Bavarian slaughterhouse to survive. What did the Commission official over there have to say about it? He said, ‘Well, it’s no problem if it closes, there’s another slaughterhouse 60 kilometres away in Austria.’ We cannot promote regional products with that mindset. There therefore needs to be a broad-based change of attitude so that regional products, too, can be offered. In addition, we need the Commission to reconsider a few pieces of legislation that play a part in ensuring that this is no longer possible. Albert Deß,

 Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for the current debate in relation to the disease in animals caused by what is being referred to as the Schmallenberg virus. According to scientists, the virus has much in common with the Akabane virus, which has been familiar for some time now in animals from Africa to Japan and Australia. The Akabane virus is harmless to humans, so that it can be assumed that the Schmallenberg virus likewise poses no threat to humans. The virus is a major danger to animals, however, and can cause enormous economic damage. Commissioner, we need to do all we can to halt the spread of this disease and perhaps even to eradicate it. In order to be able to take effective steps, there is an urgent need for mandatory reporting throughout the European Union, something that has already been agreed in Germany at federal level. As we have already heard, the virus is transmitted by biting insects and it is very difficult to protect animals from such sources of infection. Effective protection is actually only possible through the use of an appropriate vaccine. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would call on the Commission to do all in its power to speed up the development of a corresponding vaccine, so that it becomes available as soon as possible. It is also important that the Commission should organise for this data to be recorded quickly, so that the relevant data is available and the necessary measures are implemented. It is also a matter for the Commission to achieve the lifting of the trade restrictions imposed by Russia on 20 March, as already called for. I have heard reports that, as well as Russia, Ukraine, Egypt, Algeria, Mexico and the US have already imposed initial trade restrictions. The faster we act, the sooner we can prevent the further spread of this disease and perhaps even eradicate it. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank Mr Nicholson for this report, which he wrote and on which he also led the negotiations in the trialogue. I would also like to thank all those who helped to bring this compromise about. Commissioner, the direction is the right one, but the impact in the Member States will vary enormously. In Germany, this dairy package will have hardly any impact. We already have producer associations under our Market Structure Act. Many farmers in Germany are organised into cooperatives, which means that they already jointly market their milk and dairy products. Contractual dealings in Germany are regulated by statute. In the private sector, we even already have these supply contracts. Unfortunately, this dairy package will not enable us to solve fundamental problems. This dairy package regulates dealings between producers and dairies. The biggest problem that I see, however, is in the relationship between the dairies and the retailers. This is not some kind of accusation against the parties involved. Nor, as landowners, are we responsible for this, but I ask you, Commissioner, to use your influence in the Commission to ensure that we regulate further issues on the basis of this dairy package, for example the issue of terms of payment for dairy products. It is not acceptable for farmers to deliver products to dairies – fresh milk expires after three days – and for the chain stores to only pay up after 60 or 80 days. Regulation is needed here. A second point is the listing fees, the discounts, that have to be granted here. We need binding net-net prices in the dairy sector so that transparency prevails in the sector. The supply volume rules are not binding, the length of contract with fixed prices between dairies and retail must be regulated. There is thus still much to do. However, my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), will certainly be voting in favour of this dairy package with a large majority. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Bové for his report and Ms Patrão Neves for the initiative for this motion for a resolution today. There are two developments that are worrying me. The first of these, Commissioner, is the growing gap between input and farm gate prices. The second is the situation right throughout the supply chain. Commissioner, I have just looked this up. On 27 July 1961, aged 14, I got my licence to drive a tractor, and my first job was to take grain to the brewery. At that time, 100 kg cost the equivalent of EUR 25. On my way home, I bought a newspaper, which cost me the equivalent of EUR 0.05. Today, cereal costs not EUR 25, but EUR 20, while the newspaper costs EUR 0.70 instead of EUR 0.05. If grain prices had followed the same trajectory as newspaper prices, consumers would now have to pay EUR 350 for 100 kg. You can see from these figures what Europe’s farmers are providing and what contribution they have made to giving our consumers cheap prices for food. What annoys me, and I am personally the chair of a farming cooperative, is the issue of terms of payment. Given the time constraints, I will limit myself to that. It has become a bad habit for the supermarket chains to saddle these farming cooperatives with ever longer payment terms. Once upon a time, it was 24 days. Now, even in Germany, it is often 60. In other words, if we deliver fresh milk, we make 30 deliveries before we get payment for the first one. Commissioner, there is an urgent need for action in this regard. We need to tackle these payment terms in the same way as we tackled roaming charges. That is the only way this situation will be rectified. I beg you to take action. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, Mr Sawicki, ladies and gentlemen, along with several Member States, you, Mr Cioloş, and you, Mr Sawicki, have spoken out in favour of continuing food aid for needy people. As we have heard, a political decision is required to ensure that this takes place. However, the responsibility for this important area lies primarily with the Member States. It is not acceptable that people in Europe do not have enough to eat. It is part of the social responsibility of the Member States to ensure that they do. In Germany there are laws which guarantee sufficient food for all the citizens of the country. The ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union has changed the framework of the current aid programme. Strict limits have been set on market purchases. The Court has determined that the current programme in its current form does not comply with the legal basis of the Treaties. I know that we need to find answers in order to guarantee that the millions of needy people in the EU are given help. However, I would like to stress once again that the socio-political responsibility lies with the Member States. Perhaps we should also consider whether it would be better to establish programmes in the Member States rather than one European programme. These would be cofinanced with social funding from Brussels, in order to guarantee the provision of food aid in all Member States. This would also safeguard European solidarity, which I am firmly committed to, and enable the programmes to be continued. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will certainly help to find solutions for the people who are affected. I was once travelling in Brazil with a group of people when some young Brazilians asked us if they could have the food that we had left on our plates. I was shocked that something like this could happen in a rich agricultural country. We must make sure that people in Europe have enough to eat. Albert Deß,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 50 years ago, in 1961, I began my training to be a farmer. Ever since then, I have been guided by the common European agricultural policy. It has become an important mainstay of the European unification process. Since the beginning of the CAP there have been fundamental changes to its tasks. The first task was to increase food production in order for us to be less dependent on food imports. Sometime later, Europe was in the position of having to deal with food surpluses. With an ever-changing situation, there were also more and more reforms. Today, we are debating the next reform, the new approach of the CAP after 2013. As rapporteur for the CAP reform towards 2020, I am pleased that we have achieved a cross-group compromise. Even if not all of the individual interests could be taken into account in a compromise, the report was adopted with a large majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. The clear vote is an unambiguous signal to the Commission of the form that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development sees the CAP taking towards 2020. I am certain, Commissioner, that the new approach of the CAP after 2013 will also bear the stamp of the European Parliament. The Treaty of Lisbon gives us that possibility. My thanks today go to my fellow Members for their involvement and support, and to the committee chair Mr De Castro, the coordinators and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and willingness to compromise. I would like to thank the staff of the committee secretariat, the political groups and in my own private office for their splendid cooperation. Turning to the report now: food safety and the security of supply for half a billion people remain the main goals of the common agricultural policy, not only in the EU, but also worldwide. The CAP is intended to be sustainable and competitive, to supply consumers with safe, high-quality food and also to promote renewable forms of energy. The two-pillar structure of the CAP is to remain so as to create certainty of planning for our farmers for this next period. The report clearly states – and here we support the Commissioner – that the agricultural budget should remain at the current level in the next financial period. I cannot understand President Barroso’s statement that massive cuts are to be made in the second pillar. I believe that there will be cross-group opposition to this. The simplification of the common agricultural policy remains an important task. That is a core demand of our compromise. We are also calling for a fair distribution among the Member States. That is also necessary in order to create a level playing field in terms of competition. We are seeking to move away from historical and individual references towards area-based premiums. The role of small farmers is to be recognised and, on the basis of subsidiarity, the Member States are to decide themselves how to support these small farmers. The importance of young farmers is mentioned. From my point of view, it was important to avoid introducing a new additional payment system that would lead to extra control and sanction systems for greening. Overall, we have found a compromise that many Members will be able to support tomorrow so that we can send out a clear signal as regards the new approach of this agricultural policy. A large majority of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will support this report. Albert Deß,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank everyone for this intense debate, and also for the support that I have been given here. Commissioner, we are all looking forward to your communication in October and then to good, positive cooperation. European agriculture is a positive factor. It feeds more than 500 million people, farms and looks after more than 170 million hectares of arable land and pasture, it provides many jobs in areas upstream and downstream, is an important buttress of rural areas and is already the most sustainable agricultural sector in the world. I therefore cannot understand why President Barroso has spoken of huge cuts in the second pillar. In so doing he is also jeopardising the EU2020 goals – in other words, his own goals. When 14 million farmers are feeding 500 million people, is it too much to ask that European agricultural policy be used to ensure that the 500 million people also provide properly for the 14 million farmers, so to speak? Here I should like to emphasise – as has been mentioned a couple of times today already – that there have been departures from my original report on some matters. I have been in the political game too long, and I know exactly why I drafted the report as I did. Had I written the report as it stands today, what would I have had to offer in the compromise negotiations? I allowed enough margin to ensure that everyone could be pacified, and a good result has been achieved today. My report therefore had a substantial buffer. The result I wanted to achieve was for us to send a signal as Parliament that we are addressing the important aspects that are necessary if European farmers are to have a good future. Once the legislative proposals are on the table, Commissioner, we will then work intensively to achieve a good outcome together. I can already assure you that you are likely to have greater support here in Parliament than some other commissioners would have. We are able to offer you that. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, back when I was a child, I received letters from what was then Rhodesia. Three of my grandfather’s sisters were Catholic nuns in the then Rhodesia and in South Africa. They never wrote of the people of Rhodesia having to go hungry. What we hear from this country today is simply intolerable. Rhodesia, and later Zimbabwe, were the bread basket of southern Africa. Mr Mugabe – a communist socialist dictator – has managed to turn this bread basket into a famine zone. I would like to thank all the fellow Members who have put this matter back on the agenda. It is intolerable that this dictator, Mr Mugabe, has been allowed to terrorise the people of Zimbabwe for so long. I believe that the key to ending this lies in southern Africa. I regret to say that for as long as South Africa fails to put this dictator in his place, he will continue to terrorise his people. Albert Deß,

 Madam President, Commissioner, thank you Commissioner for the factual presentation of this dioxin scandal in Germany. It makes me extremely angry, including in my capacity as a farmer, that again and again, we have to deal with scandals of this kind where the cause can seemingly be attributed to carelessness, but also to criminal activity. We can put as many laws and regulations in place as we like – in Europe, we have some of the most stringent laws on the production of food and we have the lowest limit values for ingredients that could harm the health of our consumers – but still we are not immune to such dangers. That is why it must also be a requirement – and the Member States are also responsible for this – that if the public prosecutor determines that criminal activity is involved, the magnitude of the penalty must be increased substantially. Such people must not get off with a fine – prison sentences are called for here. They must be put away so that they cannot cause such a disaster again. Commissioner, I am very pleased that you have acknowledged that the German authorities took the appropriate sequence of measures – that was also my impression in Germany. There was a certain amount of political commotion about the matter not being dealt with correctly. We all need to get together and, where necessary, supplement the strict provisions that we have in place. You mentioned one particular matter with regard to which you have our full support. I, too, am in favour – and I am also speaking on behalf of my group – of the introduction of the strict segregation of food production from the production of other products to prevent such mix ups from happening. You have our support, Commissioner, when it comes to improving our provisions and regulations further to enable us to better prevent such scandals in future. Albert Deß,

Madam President, Mr Cioloş, I am pleased that you are here today to answer questions. On 18 May, the European Parliament adopted with a large majority a resolution to simplify the common agricultural policy (CAP). Of course, it has not been possible for you to implement this resolution yet, but I would like to ask you, Mr Cioloş, to take into consideration all the demands made in this motion for a resolution when you begin restructuring agricultural policy. Unfortunately, I have to point out one fly in the ointment. I have just had a discussion with a group of farmers who were concerned that your proposals for the first pillar, Mr Cioloş, would not reduce the amount of red tape, but could instead lead to a huge increase in bureaucracy. The European Union cannot be held responsible for every piece of red tape, Mr Cioloş. A large proportion of the responsibility lies with the Member States. This is why I am asking you to ensure that we can work together on the forthcoming reform so that it is structured in such a way that it can be implemented with as little administrative and supervisory effort as possible. This will allow farmers to focus on their main job, in other words, producing food, rather than requiring them to check the current legislation to find out what they need to be aware of before they do anything out in their fields or their barns. In no other agricultural area in the world are farmers burdened with so many requirements and regulations as in the European Union. You are not yet responsible for this, Mr Cioloş. You have the chance to be the first Commissioner – before you eventually step down, and I do not know when that will happen – who can say that during his period of office, the amount of bureaucracy has been reduced rather than increased. As the rapporteur for agricultural reform, I would like to offer you the opportunity to work together with us to find a solution, so that this goal can be achieved. Albert Deß,

 Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, today’s motion for a resolution will help to set the European livestock sector on the right course. I would like to thank Mrs García for this initiative. The objective of the motion is not to cut Europe off from the rest of the world or to override the rules of the market. Its aim is to put in place fair market conditions for the European livestock industry, which will help to ensure food security for more than 500 million people in future. We must ensure that the European agricultural sector is not confronted with new and highly detailed production regulations on a daily basis and that farmers are not required to provide one certificate of competence after another, while maintaining high animal welfare and environmental standards. Rules of this kind apparently do not apply to imported agricultural products. Therefore, I am grateful to all the 534 Members of this House who voted in Strasbourg in favour of requiring agricultural imports to comply with European consumer protection, animal welfare and environmental protection standards in future. Mr Cioloş, Parliament is ready to give you its full support. These standards must be applied to imports and this is why my group welcomes and supports this motion. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all those who worked on this report. Overall, their work has resulted in a good report. During the debate, it has become clear to me that the situation across Europe varies greatly. There are Member States in which a few large concerns dominate the market, and – thankfully – there are also Member States in which there are still many small retailers. There is just as much variation in the situation as regards food prices. There are Member States in which the price of food has risen substantially in recent times, and there are Member States – such as my home country of Germany – where there is merciless competition between enterprises and food prices are constantly being lowered, to the detriment of farmers. Our main concern is to call on the Commission and the Member States to review the situation and to take appropriate measures to allow farmers to add value in the food supply chain. The report also contains some very specific demands, however. I only have time to mention a few here, such as the call in paragraph 30 for a specified payment period. It is not acceptable that farmers, small businesses and cooperatives are providing short-term financing for major concerns. That is the job of the banks; it is not a job for farming cooperatives. Listing fees – as they are known – must also be investigated, Commissioner. We need a uniform regulation on this throughout Europe if we are to ensure competition. If we are to guarantee the food supply of 500 million people in the EU, then we must have fair competition for our farmers in Europe, as called for in the report. There is one more thing I would like to mention, which is that members of my group have asked for certain paragraphs to be voted on separately. As democrats, we have to accept that, but I am assuming that the vast majority of my group will vote in favour of most paragraphs so that we can achieve fair conditions for our farmers.

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, today sees an important debate on George Lyon’s report and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Lyon sincerely for the willingness to compromise that he showed in this document. We have managed to reach a good compromise that can be supported by many groups and I am hopeful that this compromise will be supported by a broad majority in the vote to take place at noon today. The common agricultural policy in Europe was and is one of the most important pillars of the European unification process. In this report we describe the effects of the common agricultural policy post 2013. The European agricultural sector produces high-quality food, protects vital rural areas and many jobs, maintains and promotes our cultural landscape and biodiversity and can make a contribution to conserving fossil fuels through the production of renewable raw materials and energy. To ensure that European agriculture can continue to perform these functions into the future, we must find a concept for the period post 2013 that will enable it to fulfil these many tasks. I welcome the fact that Commissioner Cioloş has clearly indicated that he wishes to see a continuation of a two-pillar system. My group will support this. The first pillar acts as a balance to the constraints under which European agriculture operates in relation to other agricultural regions in the world, while the second pillar involves the creation of a catalogue of measures to enable the 27 Member States to ensure that agriculture receives additional aid to enable it to fulfil its functions. The vast majority of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will vote in favour. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, clearly the Mercosur countries are important trading partners for us. However, Commissioner, this trade with the Mercosur countries should not be allowed to become a one-way street. The frequent claims made in public that Europe is closing itself off in the agricultural markets are quite wrong. We purchase over 90% of African agricultural exports and 45% of Central and South American agricultural exports. Europe is certainly not closed off to external trade. What I would criticise, Commissioner, is the information policy pursued. It has not been good. As an agricultural policymaker, I first learned that these negotiations had begun when I opened the newspapers. In future we should not have to rely on the press for our information. I urge you to inform the agricultural sector represented here in Parliament about the progress of negotiations. Another point I would criticise is the fact that the objective here is free trade that is not based on standards. How can it be that we demand high standards of consumer protection, animal protection and environmental protection in Europe, but do not require the same standards from imports? Let me offer just one example in this regard. Last year, Parliament passed the most stringent plant protection product legislation in the world. Many active ingredients are prohibited in Europe. Commissioner, we cannot have a situation in the future where food is supplied to Europe from countries in which active ingredients are used that are prohibited in Europe for reasons of consumer protection. Consumer protection is inviolable and we would do well to remember this in negotiations. Then we have nothing to fear from our competitors, and we European farmers will stand our ground against this competition. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased that the report on specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union has been so amicably discussed in the House. In the last electoral term, I was the shadow rapporteur for reform of the sugar market. At that time, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development visited the island of Réunion where I visited a small agricultural holding that grows sugar cane. Without our support, this small agricultural holding could not stay in existence. As someone from the continental mainland, I also observed that these farmers in the outermost regions of the Union do face a special set of circumstances. It is necessary for us to ensure, through certain rules on exceptions, that we offer these farmers in all these regions that are in the European Union future prospects and ensure that they are able to guarantee food security – at least for the most part – in these areas. It is up to us all to help ensure that agriculture – including through these rules on exceptions – has future prospects and that the security of supply for the local population is safeguarded. The way the report has now been drawn up provides good conditions for achieving these goals. My heartfelt thanks go to all those who have been involved. Albert Deß  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I have voted against the motion for a resolution, because in my opinion, it is lacking some important data. Recently, there has been an increasing number of reports of climate scientists having faked data. It is important for us to discuss this and make our opinions known. In order to ensure that there is no misunderstanding, I would like to explain that I have been committed for many years to reducing our use of fossil fuels and, therefore, our impact on the environment. However, I cannot understand the scaremongering that has been associated with the phrase ‘climate change’. I have experienced a great deal in my long career as a politician. In the early 1980s, people said that there would be no trees left in Germany by 2000, but Germany is greener than it has ever been. It is true that the climate is changing, but this has been happening throughout history and will continue to do so in future. For this reason, I have voted against this motion for a resolution.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, last year, and this year, too, dairy farmers made their concerns known very loudly, including in Brussels. The impression you get from the media is that it is only the dairy farmers that are in a difficult situation. The fact is that other farming sectors are also affected by this. In contrast to our dairy farmers, the pig producers, pig fatteners, poultry farmers, fruit and vegetable growers, wine growers and even cereal farmers are used to there being good and bad years and therefore do not make their voices heard so loudly. Nevertheless, I think that it is good for us to highlight the situation of these farmers today, too. Commissioner, you said that the financial and economic crisis has affected the whole of the agricultural sector and that we ought to consider how we can respond to this. When talking with the farmers affected on the ground, I hear the same things again and again: by and large, they say they are coping with the markets, apart from situations where it is extremely difficult, like it was last year and is this year for the dairy farmers and others. However, what the farmers do not understand is that we in Europe are burdening them with ever more red tape. They say that they want to work their land and feed and care for their animals rather than spend the whole day keeping books and records about what they are doing. For centuries, our farmers have produced food without keeping vast quantities of records. The yields on the land have increased, the performance of the animals has improved and today, we inundate our farmers with red tape. I have recently read that the agricultural ministers are discussing a reduction in red tape. Our farmers hardly dare believe this anymore. I hope that we can finally make some progress on this and allow our farmers to do what they do best, in other words, produce food – healthy food for half a billion people. We should support them in so doing and ensure that they are able to achieve this in future. Albert Deß,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, Commissioner, it is important for us in the European Parliament to discuss the subject of hunger in the world. We cannot simply sit silently by while the number of people suffering from hunger, which includes many children, increases. I was first elected to a parliament 20 years ago and I can still remember well how international organisations such as the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, the United Nations itself and the World Trade Organisation stated their intention of halving hunger in the world within the next 20 years. What has happened since then? Hunger has not been halved, it has increased. More than 1 billion people suffer from hunger every day. The opposite of what these organisations intended has occurred. There is a wide range of different causes for this. There are countries such as Zimbabwe where an incompetent government has transformed the bread basket of Africa into a famine region. A communist president has brought this rich country to a position where people are suffering from hunger and we say nothing. However, we share the responsibility for this. We spend weeks, if not years, talking about the climate in one hundred years’ time. The people who are suffering from hunger today and tomorrow are not interested in the climate in one hundred years. They want something to eat tomorrow, but we have no answers to their problems. Without wanting to neglect the issues of the future, it is a question of simple humanity to concern ourselves with people who are suffering from hunger today. Mr de Gucht, when we say that we intend to halve hunger by 2050, I find this almost insulting. As a world community, it must be possible for us to reduce the number of people who do not have enough to eat much more quickly. We can transport weapons to every corner of the world, but apparently we are not able to do this with food. This is a failure of the world community, which I would like to denounce. We must find other answers than the ones which we have come up with today. Albert Deß  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, I am grateful to Mrs Herranz García for bringing up this topic today in Parliament. This is a discussion which is fundamental to food policy. I am not interested in shaming Brazil or other countries. The basic question is this: Do we need these strict regulations for European agricultural production in the interests of consumer safety? If the answer is ‘yes’, then this means that consumer protection is regarded as a coherent whole. If the regulations are needed, then the same rules must apply to imports as to our own farmers. The Commission must not allow imports from countries which do not fulfil these requirements. Cattle farmers in Europe must not be punished because one cow in their herd has an ear tag missing, when imports are allowed from cattle herds which do not have a single ear tag. This is not acceptable. If traceability is so important for consumer protection, then it must also apply to imports. If we cannot ensure that this is the case, then it is unfair to our farmers to demand it of them. I have the impression that those people in the Commission who are responsible for imports are applying double standards. As already discussed, I am not interested in partitioning off Europe. I would like to see fair competition for our farmers in Europe so that we can continue to guarantee the food supply of half-a-billion people in future. I can assure you of one thing, Commissioner, and you can pass this on to your successor, Parliament will continue to touch on this sore point. We will not give up until equal competitive conditions have been established. We have good arguments that we can bring up repeatedly to ensure that food security is guaranteed in Europe in future. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the request to use the urgent procedure put forward by the Commission is certainly not perfect. I can partially agree with what the previous speaker said. However, to not allow this request to use the urgent procedure now would send completely the wrong signals to the dairy farmers, who are expecting at least initial responses. That is why I support this request to use the urgent procedure. In the course of this procedure, we will have the opportunity to improve the motion by means of amendments and, as Mr Häusling suggested, to cede powers. It is absolutely the case that there are possibilities to put a time limit on these powers so that we only give the Commission a power for two years before we then decide on the matter again. I would therefore ask for your support in order to put this request for use of the urgent procedure on the agenda. (Applause) Albert Deß,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome the fact that this request to use the urgent procedure was passed here in Parliament today by a large majority. In this way, we have sent a signal to our dairy farmers and have not shied away from the responsibility. In contrast to a minority of my fellow Members from other groups, we see, in this request to use the urgent procedure, an additional tool to get help to dairy farmers at a difficult time. It is certainly true that this request from the Commission did come very late in the day and that it is less than what is possible. That said, it is always better than doing nothing at all. The views within my own group about the proposed buy-back programme also diverge widely. The programme would have to be obligatory for it to have any impact at all. Yet I see no majority for that in this Parliament or in the Council. Furthermore, such a programme would not be acceptable to some of the Member States as it would be tantamount to a cutting back of the balancing out arrangement and also of the quotas. The indication that quotas are to be raised for priority groups is a decision that is already the law in force. The inclusion of milk and milk products in Article 186 for immediate measures in the event of market disturbances is to be welcomed. Nonetheless, I will be tabling an amendment to the effect that this measure should be restricted to two years. If it proves its worth, we will then agree to an extension. Finally, I would like to say thank you for the EUR 280 million. Commissioner, you have indeed largely accommodated Parliament. I know that you do not have any more money available to you. I ask that the – possibly amended – motion for a resolution be approved on Thursday. Albert Deß,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is, of course, extremely difficult to summarise this problem in two minutes, but I will try to do it in the style of bullet points. The dairy sector is in trouble. Many dairy farmers are seeing their very existence under threat. The main reason for this is a huge drop in milk product sales. The Commission really should have acted more swiftly in this regard. I would also have preferred to see stronger sales promotion measures instead of a greater amount of intervention, such as butter fat being used once again in the ice cream industry. Last year, when the price of butter reached more than EUR 4 for a short time, a large proportion of the ice cream industry stopped processing butter fat. I know the figures for Germany, which show that around 100 000 tonnes is no longer being processed by the food industry, which corresponds to a million tonnes of milk. We must try to stimulate sales once again, in order to clear these quantities from the market. I would like to thank the groups that have helped in drawing up our joint motion for a resolution. Unfortunately, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance did not participate in this discussion. Commissioner, as a short-term measure we are calling for an increase in the de minimis subsidies in an additional motion which is being tabled with 40 signatures, because this would be an opportunity to help the smaller dairy farmers in particular. It would also make sense to introduce an early retirement regulation. I know a lot of farmers who are 58 years old and who would like to stop working soon. An appropriate regulation would be needed for this. Commissioner, I would like to thank you sincerely for your work. I would ask you to put in place appropriate regulations to improve the situation of our dairy farmers. Perhaps you will still have the chance to remedy this situation in the near future.

 I abstained in today’s vote on the ACTA agreement, because I believe that we should wait for the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union on ACTA. The intention is for the Court to carry out a definitive examination of whether the agreement changes existing European law. I have read the agreement myself and I believe that this is not the case. In 2010, the EU seized 103 million products at its external borders that were most probably counterfeit products. For the first time the estimated value of the equivalent genuine products was also quoted, this being more than EUR 1 billion. In view of these incredible figures, I believe that we urgently need to work even more intensively to combat product piracy in order to safeguard the competitiveness of our European industry. A global agreement on the protection of intellectual property is therefore essential. Angelika Niebler,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I assume that each of you here in plenary has a smartphone and that you use them all the time, wherever you are – whether you are out and about at home, in your own country, or in Europe, whether you are on holiday or on business. We here in Parliament are by no means exceptional; our citizens are also permanently mobile and on the move in Europe. Our young people, in particular, are constantly online nowadays. That is why I am particularly pleased that tomorrow, we will be able to adopt the Roaming III Regulation, as it is known, which will enter into force on 1 July 2012. In other words, just in time for the holiday season, we will be able to give our citizens the benefit of lower tariffs when they use smartphones in Europe. The future belongs to mobile devices. These days, everyone is mobile 24 hours a day. In recent years, there has been a huge increase in data transfer via smartphones in particular, and we will see further huge increases in the years ahead. In contrast, the costs of using a mobile phone abroad are still extremely high; indeed, they have hardly come down at all. That is unacceptable. The charges must reflect reality. We cannot allow people using smartphones at home or in another European country to be charged many times what they have to pay at home for making calls, sending or receiving texts or downloading data. I can tell you that I am with a German provider, and at the beginning of this week, my provider informed me that I will have to pay EUR 8.20 if I download one megabyte of data here in Brussels. That is a complete rip-off, and we cannot allow it to continue. What, then, will the new Roaming Regulation do? Its main aim is reduced charges for all our citizens. We hope to achieve this by creating greater competition in the roaming market in future. We are introducing maximum charges, and one particularly new element is a maximum retail charge for data transfer. The first maximum retail charge will take effect on 1 July 2012. In future, one megabyte will cost no more than EUR 0.70. The charges will be lowered further from 1 July 2013, when a maximum retail charge of EUR 0.45 per megabyte will come into force. The third price reduction will take effect on 1 July 2014, when the maximum charge will become EUR 0.20 per megabyte. We had to fight hard for these maximum retail charges in tough negotiations with the Council. I would like to extend my great thanks to my shadow rapporteurs and, in particular, to the rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, Robert Goebbels. Had we not fought so hard for better charges, then we would not be today where we hope to be after 1 July. The market will also be opened up to new providers without a network of their own, in what is known as an open access solution. Moreover, from 1 July 2014, consumers will be able to choose roaming services from providers other than their national provider. This proposed solution is known as unbundling and, in future, European customers will also be able to use local services when travelling abroad – known as local break-out – by being able to choose the best offer from the various local operators, as is already the case for WLan access. We have also introduced consumer protection rules. In future, these will apply not just within Europe, but also outside the European Union. The obligation to send a warning when users reach a certain tariff level, a certain level of charges, will also apply abroad. Other consumer protection rules have also been introduced in order to prevent involuntary roaming. All in all, I can say that today is a good day for our citizens of Europe. I am pleased that from 1 July, charges will be reasonable, even for roaming. (Applause) Angelika Niebler,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Ms Kroes, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank everyone very much for the many appreciative comments. I am very pleased, because I have never before received so much praise in Parliament. However, I would also like to express my gratitude and, most importantly, to return the thanks of all the Members of this Parliament who have given me such strong support during the debates. Of course, I would like to thank the Danish Presidency and the Commission once again for their excellent cooperation. It is true that we have a European internal market and a Single Euro Payments Area. I believe that our objective must be to establish a single European communication area, as many Members have already said in the course of this debate. Creating a roaming-free area in Europe must be our ultimate goal. I very much hope that we will be able to achieve this in the near future. I also hope, Ms Kroes, that we do not need a Roaming IV Regulation, as Mr Rübig has suggested. I hope, as a result of the structural measures and the competition which will now develop, that one provider will make a bold move and stop charging for roaming altogether. I hope that this will happen before the revision and before you submit a report here in 2016. I hope that the competitive market functions in such a way that the subject of roaming finally becomes a thing of the past. I would like to pass on my warm thanks. I am looking forward to the vote tomorrow and I hope that Parliament will give the report substantial support. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, who also so successfully put across Parliament’s position in the negotiations with the Council. ‘Spectrum Gunnar’, you have my thanks! More and more European citizens make use of mobile Internet services, and the trend is upwards. I have a couple more figures to highlight this. In 2010 alone, average monthly smartphone usage doubled to 79 MB from 35 MB the previous year. Similarly, in 2010 3 million new tablets – such as the iPad – were newly connected to the mobile network. In future, too, even greater data traffic is anticipated. Experts predict that mobile data traffic will increase by a factor of 26 between 2010 and 2015, and in 2015 some 788 million people will use the Internet exclusively from mobile devices. Against this backdrop, the first European radio spectrum policy programme, which we will be deciding on tomorrow, therefore has a particular role to play. Our goal is clear – more frequencies need to be made available for wireless broadband networks in future than has been the case so far. The flood of data was threatening to block up the transmission capacities that we have hitherto had available. More frequencies will mean that we can continue to use our mobile Internet services without interruption in future. If we adopt the radio spectrum policy programme tomorrow with a broad majority, we will have done something positive for our citizens in Europe. As you all know, I am currently also fighting on another front, as rapporteur for the new Roaming Regulation, to bring about better conditions for mobile Internet use. I believe that surfing the net when abroad must become much cheaper. Commissioner, you have already brought forward a bold proposal in this regard. We also aim to be somewhat bolder in Parliament, as we want to achieve something for our European consumers. If the Roaming Dossier – as is my hope – can be wrapped up in the first half of this year I would be very pleased if I earned the nickname ‘Roaming Angelika’. Angelika Niebler  (PPE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure we all agree that our objective is an open, fair Internet. That has already been mentioned by many fellow Members. We need this not only for our citizens, for users of the network and for the economy – the Commission mentioned this – but we also need it for our policies and for democratisation processes. I need only remind you of the Arab Spring. We would not have been able to find out about many of the developments in the North African states and in the Middle East if it had not been for the Internet. How will we achieve this? I would like to refer to what Mr van Nistelrooij said. The Netherlands has gone ahead with a regulation on net neutrality. That is – please forgive me, Mr van Nistelrooij – the wrong approach to take. I think it is important for us to take a genuine European approach here, for us not to propose 27 separate regulations in this regard, but at least in Europe to seek to take a unified, harmonised approach to this issue. Therefore, I would, above all, ask the Commission, after careful analysis of the facts and with the involvement of BEREC and the national regulators, to present a proposal as quickly as possible. In one sub-area – roaming – we are currently having this debate. Structural changes are already underway in this area in connection with switching operators. I believe that this is the right course to take. Perhaps we do not need any horizontal regulation of net neutrality at all. Roaming provides a good example here. I would like to make one final point. As I see it, the most important thing for our citizens at home is that there should be no misleading advertising in respect of fast transmission rates. Many providers entice customers with offers that promise extremely fast data transmission speeds. However, these offers can only be exploited at three o’clock on the morning. At other times, the transmission rates do not reach anywhere near the speeds frequently promised in the advertisements. I would be grateful – to you, too, Ms Gaj – if you could check once again with BEREC and get back to us as to whether the subject of ‘no misleading advertising in respect of fast transmission rates’ is also being addressed.

 Firstly, I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, who has succeeded over months of tough negotiations in drafting a report on the subject of women and business leadership which, to a large extent, is very balanced and deserves our support. I would like to explain briefly why I voted against paragraph 1 and paragraph 16b. The figures on the proportion of women in management positions are shameful. Therefore, I am fully convinced that we finally need to take targeted measures to bring about a significant increase in this proportion. However, I feel that the calls made in paragraph 1 and paragraph 16b go too far. I do not believe that we should intervene in the operational management of businesses or set quotas even for the board of directors. Therefore, we should first of all call on companies to take voluntary measures. In particular, I think that 2012 is far too early for the introduction of legislative provisions and quotas. However, in order to send out a clear political signal that something needs to be done urgently and, at the same time, to support the efforts made by Mrs Kroes, I have voted in favour of the resolution as a whole. Angelika Niebler  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we definitely need more women in the top executive suites of companies throughout the European Union. You all know the statistics. Only one in ten board members in the European Union are women; 97% of board members are men. I think that we all agree that action is urgently needed. I should like to thank the Commissioner. Commissioner, it was you who took the bold step in March and called for action. You called on companies to take voluntary action. If they do not, you will table a legislative proposal, a legal basis, in March 2012. Thank you so much. The figures that we have seen in the meantime illustrate that something has already been done. If you had not been so bold, Mrs Reding, we would not have made these small steps. I should also like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, for her excellent draft. I agree with many of the statements in this draft. I shall support the draft, even though I take a different view of the quota as it now stands in the report. I take the view that, if self-regulation does nothing to help, a statutory quota is needed in order to put pressure on companies. However, I also take the view that we should start by introducing this quota for the supervisory structures of large companies, not for the operational side of businesses. I shall not therefore support the proposal in paragraph 16(b); however, I shall vote in favour of the report, because it says the right things. How women stand on the quota is a question of their own self-image. I would have no problem in using a quota to open the door. Whether or not I am good at my job is something that I still have to prove, regardless of how I get there. In that respect, a quota helps, but it is no substitute for performance. No woman has a problem with a door being held open. You have to walk through and prove yourself. Women in the European Union also need to be given an opportunity to walk through. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Madam President, I would like to ask you, Mrs Harms, why you have not thanked Mr Oettinger. Why did you not say thank you? I think the accusations that you have made against him here are outrageous. Mr Oettinger was the only person who made the most of the opportunity to bring together everyone involved immediately after Fukushima and to insist that we carry out stress tests at a European level, regardless of the responsibilities. Now we have a result that goes far beyond the tests carried out over the last 15 or 20 years, with European involvement and with peer reviews by teams that have been put together at a European level. I believe it is unfair for you to continue following your own green policy without taking any responsibility. Angelika Niebler,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mrs Reding, ladies and gentlemen, let me perhaps introduce the topic with a few examples. Greece and other states are heavily in debt, although billions from the structural funds have been poured into these countries for many years. How can we improve the use of these resources and how can the utilisation of these resources be better controlled? My second example relates to Eurobonds. What effect do they have on the European budget? Thirdly, if we were to introduce a financial transaction tax in Europe, what would the consequences be? For all these questions, Parliament demands in its reports that a regulatory impact assessment be carried out. After all, we need facts in order to be able to take politically sound decisions. That is what my report on improving the guarantee of independent impact assessments is all about. This is not a new issue. It has occupied us, together with other issues concerning the improvement of legislation, for over ten years. However, despite all the efforts of the Commission to improve its impact assessment as well as those that we have made in this regard in the European Parliament, the quality of the impact assessment is still in need of improvement. My report puts forward proposals for how, with regard to the European Commission and the impact assessments that it carries out, as well as with regard to Parliament’s impact assessment studies, we can succeed in bringing about this improvement. In terms of its content, the report is divided into four sections. Firstly, there are general requirements for impact assessments at European level. The second section contains proposals directed at the European Commission and it lists potential areas where improvements can be made. In the third section, I discuss how we in the European Parliament can better optimise the regulatory impact assessment as an instrument. In the last section, I then propose that we in Parliament create an autonomous impact assessment structure. With regard to the general requirements for impact assessments at European level, it is important to note that we need to move away from pure cost analysis towards an examination of the economic, social and health-related impact of legislation at European level. Secondly, I think it is important that we carry out an SME test in connection with all regulatory impact assessments and also examine the effect on industrial competitiveness in Europe. Thirdly, in this report, we propose the early publication by the Commission of road maps of proposed legislation in order to give Parliament and the stakeholders the opportunity to express their opinions during the consultation period. With regard to the European Commission, we call, in particular, for the members of the Impact Assessment Board that was set up a while ago in the Commission to be independent and for the parliamentary committees to be involved in the work at an early stage. With regard to Parliament, we believe it is important for us actually to utilise the regulatory impact assessment as an instrument. Up to now, a few committees have been using it, but I think we need to make much more extensive use of this instrument in our discussions in Parliament. If we succeed in developing Parliament’s own resources and establishing an autonomous structure under the leadership of Members of this House in order to develop a method that allows us to carry out professional regulatory impact assessments within the European Parliament, then I believe we will have achieved a great deal with this report. I hope it will receive your support tomorrow in the vote. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Mr President, I apologise for taking the floor once again, but I believe that some confusion has arisen, because my fellow Members are not currently discussing my report, but the report on social responsibility, which will be debated later. Perhaps we could first finish the debate on the subject of the impact assessment – I believe Mr Baldassarre had asked to speak on the subject of my report – and then we can move on to the next report. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe 2020 strategy – to be honest, I do not feel like discussing the Europe 2020 strategy at all. Ten years ago, we adopted a strategy, the Lisbon Strategy. When you now look back at this past decade, the results are limited, if I may put it in those modest terms. I think that we should currently be focusing on what really matters to people at home in our Member States, rather than making the same mistake again. They are wondering whether we will be able to ensure the stability of our currency. Will there be inflation? What lessons do we need to learn from the developments over the last two years, from the financial and economic crisis, and now from the currency crisis? Are we really taking to task the players in the financial markets who have contributed to the crisis? I would emphatically call on the Commission, first and foremost, to take steps to ensure rapid financial market regulation and progress in Europe in order to prevent, as has been the case in recent years, money being sent around the globe five times in the same day and many people making a profit on this while losses are being nationalised. I would ask the Commission to demand that Member States exercise strict budgetary discipline and implement appropriate rules. I would also ask for the earliest possible tightening of the Stability and Growth Pact. This is where we should be focusing our efforts. I urge the Commission to take requisite measures, but not as before, off its own bat or by discussing them thoroughly with Member States. Instead, it should finally take Parliament seriously as an equal legislator alongside the 27 Members States. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, over recent months, the conditions for the people, as well as the overall political and economic situation, have dramatically deteriorated in Yemen. We Europeans must therefore do everything we can to finally stabilise the country. High Representative, might I ask you to please prevent Yemen from becoming a second Afghanistan. We must do everything in our power to fight international terrorism. We will only be able to achieve that, however, if we also support a peace process in Yemen. We need to achieve peace in the region and we need to support the peace efforts of the government there. The Yemeni Government could also be reminded, once again, that it needs to ensure that there is no discrimination in Yemen – only then can there be peace. Peace requires democratic structures that uphold the rights of minorities. That is our European path, and it may differ from other paths. I ask you, in your new role, to spare no efforts to walk this European path with us. Without political stability, Yemen has no chance. With political stability, the local economy can recover, then an economy can be built up and people can be given future prospects. I ask you to work hard for this. I also ask you to make your influence count to ensure that the auxiliary troops there can provide humanitarian assistance. There are over 130 000 refugees from Somalia in Yemen. The situation on the ground is dreadful. I put all my hopes on you, Baroness Ashton, in the expectation that you will use your influence here. Please also stand up for the six hostages, for the European citizens – one Briton and five Germans – who are being held as hostages in Yemen. Maybe you can also help to get them freed. Many thanks.

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you will all be familiar with Google, the internet search engine. You will probably also know about the new Google Books Project, which everyone has been discussing over the last few months. The aim of the project is to scan in books from libraries and make them available over the internet, so that readers have quick and easy access to a large number of works on the web. From the perspective of readers and internet users, this is a wonderful idea. However, what does it mean for authors, creative people, artists and publishers? What part will they play in the publication of their work on the web? We must look closely at these questions over the next few months. You may already be aware that publishers and authors in the US have initiated legal proceedings against Google with regard to the scanning and publication of works on the web. As far as I know, the legal dispute has been resolved and the parties have settled out of court. However, the questions remain unanswered and they relate not only to the situation with Google, because there are certain to be similar cases in future. We must deal with these questions as quickly as possible. Does copyright need to be adapted in the digital age? Do we need to change existing structures? In this respect, I am thinking particularly of the role of the collecting societies, which we have often discussed in Parliament. Are new monopolies being created on the web? How should we react to this? How will this change the structures in our countries, for example, with regard to the bookshops in the regions? What are the opposing interests in this case and how can we find a suitable balance between them? Authors and publishers want to receive a financial reward for their work. This also applies, of course, when their works are made available on the internet. Libraries want to put their archives on the web without having to sign a licence agreement with every copyright holder first. The interests of consumers are clear. They would very much like to have quick and easy access to the content on the web. We have not yet reached the point of being able to discuss possible solutions, but we need to ask ourselves a lot of questions and that is the purpose of the written question submitted to the Commission by the Committee on Legal Affairs. Do we need to make distinctions in order to resolve the copyright issues, for example, with regard to content? If so, what distinctions should be made? The Commission seems to be moving in this direction, as it is first of all focusing on the situation of the library stocks. Should there be a process of mass digitisation in future, or is our existing licensing system sufficient to resolve the problem? How can copyright clearance be simplified in the internet age? As you know, copyright is primarily a national right and in this respect, we must once again ask ourselves: is this still an up-to-date approach? How should we deal with orphan works in future, in other words, books whose copyright holder cannot be identified or located? Should we perhaps distinguish between literary works and scientific or academic works? For example, the authors of novels earn their living from the publication of their books, but when scientists make their papers available on the web, they are primarily interested in making a name for themselves in their field of research and are less reliant on the money that their work earns. There are numerous questions that we need to ask ourselves and I am pleased to be able to discuss them with you. I would like to consider one last important point and that is once again the subject of collecting societies. Look at how easy it is nowadays to download music from the internet. You simply go to iTunes and buy songs for 20, 30, 40 or 50 cents. What are the implications for the collecting societies? Do we still need them? I would be pleased if the Commission could once again give us an idea of what the current situation is. In Parliament, we have been asking the Commission for years to take a look at the collecting societies. To put it rather imprecisely, these are also monopolistic bodies, which have been established over a period of decades. I am interested to know what the Commission is planning. My final point is that if you take a platform like Google, which makes everything freely available, this will result in a monopoly being created on the web. We need to consider how the situation should be handled in order to ensure that we do not end up with just one supplier, who then decides on the conditions for access to content on the web. I am looking forward to a debate with you over the next few weeks and months and I will be interested to hear the Commission’s response to the first question from the Committee on Legal Affairs. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I have three points to make. The first is that the car industry is a key industry for Europe and – this has already been said – when you include all the upstream and downstream businesses and the whole supply industry, 12 million jobs depend on it. I just want to emphasise this one more time as Mr Chatzimarkakis is sitting there in front of me, having just said that the German Government’s efforts were electioneering bluster. I can only refute this definitively. It is a mocking affront to the workers employed in this sector across numerous European countries who have to fear for their jobs day in and day out. Secondly, rescuing Opel is in the common interests of Europe as a whole. I think it is particularly important to stress this, irrespective of the debate today. There are sites in the UK, Belgium, Poland, Spain, Germany and other European countries. If Opel is rescued by the fact that there is an investor, namely Magna, that there are bridging loans, for which the German Government fought, it is not only in Germany’s interests but those of Europe as a whole. We must all take steps to retain jobs in our home countries. I am pleased. Where would we be today if we had not taken steps to bring about the trusteeship solution? There would not be any need for further debate today in that case, as the debate would have been done and dusted in any case when General Motors drew GM Europe along with it into the mess surrounding its insolvency. My third point is that there are strict rules for State aid. I am confident that the Commission will examine this matter in a proper manner doing justice to the interests involved. The crucial question will be whether Opel Europe can be profitable again in the medium term. I am confident that the solution that has now been produced and on which Magna, too, is working, and which involves many other European States, can be implemented. I ask the Commission to also provide the relevant authorisation and I would like to conclude by re-stating that, in this case, we have achieved something positive for the car industry in Europe as a whole! Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Ms McAvan, warmly for her excellent work once again. Good pharmacovigilance protects the citizens of Europe. At the same time, we are also bolstering informed patients. It was therefore very important to close the safety loopholes exposed and actually opened up by the Mediator case as soon as possible. From now on, a company that removes a medicinal product from the market must state the reasons why it is doing so. The other Member States will also be informed via the European Medicines Agency – something that is irremissible for the protection of patients in Europe’s internal market, too. There is one point that is particularly close to my heart, which is the better readability of package inserts. Many patients really do complain about the complexity of package inserts. They say they are too difficult, too hard to understand, too unreadable, too confusing. This is a subject that the older elements of the population in particular bring up, although it is not only them. Some patients are even so scared by the side effects when trying to find important information that, in the end, they do not even take the medicine. Together with Mr Liese, I therefore advocated the idea that the package insert should be made more readable for patients and that a drug facts box containing the most important information, including the side effects, should be included on the package insert, written in plain language and given graphic emphasis. I am very pleased about the result obtained from the negotiations, and about the fact that the Commission, Commissioner Dalli, has also promised to produce a report on better readability. I hope that the Commission will keep its promise and also that it does so as soon as possible. I would be interested to hear – and I am happy to take the opportunity presented by the presence of Commissioner Dalli with us here today – whether there are already specific ideas in this regard at this point. I would be really interested to hear the answer to that question. I would like to offer my thanks to the Commission for having tackled this issue, as it really does represent a major step towards patient friendliness if we can improve the package insert and make it more readable.

 I have a question for Ms Girling. She has just stated that the rules for gluten intolerance will not be of any further help. I believe that it is very important to protect these people because intolerance sufferers require this strict diet. If we fail to include them in the high protection standards of this regulation, instead depending solely on food labelling, then the necessary level of protection is not assured. It is for this reason that I strongly support this resolution and would like to ask Ms Girling why she believes this is not the case. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
).  
– (DE) 
Mr President, the average consumer has complete freedom to choose products in the supermarket and to consume them afterwards. The provisions of the Food Labelling Regulation are sufficient for this. Certain groups, such as infants and small children, require particular protection when it comes to composition and labelling, however. As a mother of a one-year-old daughter who breast-fed her child for seven months, I am very pleased that milk replacement products can no longer be advertised with euphemistic images suggesting that these products might even be better than breast milk. I also welcome the fact that follow-on milk is once again to be examined, as I also decided against using this milk. It tastes sweet and actually encourages the child to prefer such products, so that in the future it will not drink conventional milk. People who suffer from gluten intolerance need special foods if they are to avoid serious complications, such as bowel cancer. It is for this reason that I also believe it important to maintain a high standard of protection here. This is only possible by incorporating gluten intolerance in the regulation. This includes, for example, provisions requiring that the foods for these patients should provide the same amount of vitamins and minerals as the foods they replace. It is vital that this protection standard is maintained. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
),

 I can only agree that we should put an end to the wastage of food. The figures are alarming: 60% of food waste in European households could be avoided. The Commission has come to the conclusion that a fifth of the food is thrown away because ‘best before’ dates are not used correctly. I can therefore only support the call for 2013 to be declared the European Year against Food Waste, with information and educational initiatives. We need citizens to be more aware, right from childhood onwards. We need to explain to our citizens what the ‘best before’ date means. The ‘best before’ date is not an expiry date. Consumers should use it only as a guide. The ‘use by’ date for perishable goods is different. These products should not be consumed after such a date. We all have a responsibility to prevent food waste across Europe and to create greater understanding. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
),

 In the European Parliament, we have been fighting for safe, high-quality foodstuffs for many years. The text that we have voted on today provides anything but this, as it waters down the current standards for the quality of fruit juices in Europe. Therefore, I was unable to vote in favour of the compromise package today. However, I would also like to express my criticism of the negotiation process. It is unacceptable for the opinion of the lead committee to be disregarded to a large extent in the compromise package. The European Parliament fought long and hard to be given equal legislative powers. We must also exercise this responsibility in the negotiations for the good of the citizens of Europe. In the interests of these citizens, I would have liked the result of the vote to have been different today. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, today’s vote in the European Parliament aimed at combating Internet pornography is pioneering the protection of our children. We will have more protection for the victims and better prevention. The measures adopted will enable better prevention of all abuse of children, in particular the growing phenomenon of child pornography on the Internet. National laws are not enough to combat child Internet pornography. Here the European Union offers us an opportunity to stamp out these grievous activities on a Europe-wide basis. As a young mother, it is a particular concern and very important for me that pornographic material involving children should be taken down off the Internet immediately. I therefore welcome the decision to prescribe the deletion of such material as the ideal solution. The new regulations also provide a greater level of protection for the victims throughout Europe through higher, more stringent penalties for the perpetrators. I fully support the comprehensive approach taken by the directive. The legal framework is every bit as important as information and prevention measures. This law puts us on the right path for protecting the youngest members of our society. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
),  
in writing.

 I would like to thank Mrs Sommer, the rapporteur, for her excellent work over the last four years. Today’s vote in the European Parliament is groundbreaking. It brings more clarity and openness for consumers. The model I have in mind is that of responsible consumers who are aware of what they are buying. However, that will only be the case when they also know what a product contains. Today’s decision will introduce standardised, mandatory nutrition labelling relating to per 100 g/100 ml amounts, thereby allowing consumers to compare products on the supermarket shelves. All the existing food labelling is voluntary, sometimes confusing and difficult to compare. Mandatory labelling which shows the nutritional value of foods will give consumers the information they need to make informed purchasing decisions. Consumers are increasingly being misled or deceived about food. We only need to think of imitation cheese on pizza, reconstituted ham, ice cream that contains no milk and chocolate biscuits without chocolate. Often, cheap substitutes or aromas are used. All these imitation products must, in future, be labelled as such. The food labelling regulation is a major success on behalf of European consumers, which is why I have supported it. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, I am not convinced with regard to all of the points of the compromise, but I know that the new regulation represents a definite improvement on the current legal situation. First of all, we will get a standardised European technical language for the performance of construction products and streamlined and simplified procedures. We have made progress with the European internal market and, in so doing, we have benefited the companies and also, through standardised safety requirements, the consumers, too. In principle, I regard relief from bureaucratic regulations for micro-enterprises to be important and sensible. However, we also need to take account of the fact that micro-enterprises that process construction products are also users and must also be protected. I am therefore pleased that my proposal was included in the compromise. This provides for simplified procedures for micro-enterprises in connection with the evaluation of the performance characteristics of construction products. However, if they apply such a procedure, they must prove the equivalence of the procedure used with the procedure that is actually provided for throughout Europe. This is the only way to ensure that the details of the performance characteristics are also accurate and reliable and that the safety of buildings is also ensured throughout Europe. Anja Weisgerber, 
 rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, those who helped produce this report and everyone who contributed to this splendid result. Without the constructive and very open collaboration with both the Commission and with the Belgian Presidency of the Council, it would not be possible to conclude this package tomorrow. As I am sure you can imagine, I am very satisfied with this result. The repeal of a total of eight outdated and obsolete directives will enable us to take another step in the direction of less bureaucracy in Europe. What is interesting in said directives is that they largely became obsolete because they have already been replaced by international standards that represent the latest state of the art. Member State rules and regulations are often rendered obsolete by harmonised European rules and regulations, after all. In this case, European rules and regulations have become superfluous thanks to international stipulations. If we want to make progress towards our target of having 25% less bureaucracy in Europe by 2012, we need to nail our colours to the mast now. To put it in the words of the Chair of the High Level Group of Independent Stakeholders on Administrative Burdens, Edmund Stoiber, we in Europe must not only purse our lips, we need to whistle loudly. In other words, our words must be followed up by tangible action. When it comes to that action, the devil is often in the detail, however. This directive repealing eight directives relating to metrology has shown this clearly once again. Measuring instruments for cold water meters for non-clean water, alcohol meters, certain weights, tyre pressure gauges and equipment to measure the standard mass of grain or the size of ship tanks have been replaced, in practice, by more modern digital equipment. The outdated equipment is used increasingly rarely and the rules governing such equipment can thus be abolished. There are also no consequences for the functioning of the internal market or for the high standard of consumer protection, which remains of great importance to us. Yet the Council has been blocking this package for some time. We have managed, however, to reach a reasonable compromise between the Council and Parliament in the informal trialogue, and even to do so at first reading – which is always the exception rather than the rule for us. The substance of that agreement is as follows: one directive – namely that concerning the calibration of ship tanks – is to be repealed immediately, which is to say, with effect from 1 July 2011, while the remaining seven directives will be repealed once the recast version of the Framework Measuring Instruments Directive (MID), which the Commission is currently working on, has been adopted. The Commission will produce a new proposal for the MID by the end of April 2011. The idea is that the Commission, when reviewing the MID, will also examine whether and, if so, what elements from the old directives should be retained and should therefore be incorporated into the MID to that end. If the Member States provide evidence that certain elements within the seven directives are still necessary, for example, on consumer protection grounds, such as provisions from the directive relating to tyre pressure gauges for motor vehicles, these sections will be incorporated into the Framework Measuring Instruments Directive. Once the recast version of the MID has been adopted, the remaining directives will be repealed. This is a signal that Europe is serious about cutting red tape and that we are eager to create the conditions for sustainable economic growth. I am proud of the fact that the European Parliament is doing its bit, in this way, to help cut red tape and to produce better, more streamlined and simpler lawmaking. Allow me just to conclude with a brief word about the correlation tables. These are the tables that the Member States are supposed to draw up in order to document how they have implemented the directive. In the end, we agreed on a less strict wording in this regard. We fought for stricter wordings in future, however, and we achieved our goal in this regard. The Conference of Presidents will champion this cause accordingly to the Council and the Commission. This represents a success that we have the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs to thank for. Anja Weisgerber, 
 rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow Members, including my appreciation of their valuable contributions to the debate tonight. After the vote in the morning, we need to shift our focus to the future. Naturally, we are looking forward to seeing how the individual rules and regulations turn out – the Commission has now announced that it will table its proposal for the Measuring Instruments Directive (MID) by the end of April. It will then also be possible to check whether any of the individual legislative regimes that we are removing from circulation are to be incorporated. It is important, as Mrs Comi also said, that no legal vacuum arises. Mrs Gebhardt, I can tell you that that was also a very important concern for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and it was one that we were able to follow up on. For me, however, it is also important to mention that the Member States are required to document even more strictly why certain aspects or elements should be retained, as it is only in those circumstances that we really need European regulations; they are not an end in themselves. I am also looking forward to the Internet consultation that the Commission has announced and which will take place between 6 September and 1 November 2011. The consultation will also involve the companies affected, the authorities and so forth. Once again, I will be listening closely to businesses. When it comes to the existing directive, too, I checked whether these measuring instruments were still in use and, as it happened, the response every single time – for example, from my wine growing association, which I asked about alcohol meters – was that such items of equipment certainly are not used any longer. We therefore need to look very closely into this. If we really do want to make progress towards this target of cutting red tape in Europe by 25% by 2012 – and that, of course, is no longer very far away – we need to make major progress in this area. We, as Parliament, are ready to play a part. Finally, I just have one more thing to say about the correlation tables. I want to state, at this point, that, once again, what we have here is a compromise, but, with regard to the future, I would like to call on the Member States to commit to actually drawing up these tables because this really is about a uniform implementation of the rules and regulations throughout Europe.

 Mr President, in relation to the adoption of the Toys Directive, I would like to point out that, when we adopted the directive, we had an objective in mind, namely, making children’s toys safer, as children, in particular, still growing and developing as they are, have a particularly sensitive reaction to hazardous substances and chemicals. Considering the most up-to-date scientific knowledge at that point, we laid down the strictest requirements anywhere in the world for toys through European legislation. As every year, this issue comes to the fore in the run-up to Christmas, and for me personally, too, as a mother-to-be, this issue is one that is close to my heart, and I think it is very important that we have the strictest standards. That is why I helped initiate this debate. I did so in the light of new expert opinions that have concluded that the strictest limit values for heavy metals are not strict enough, given the latest scientific knowledge. We included a clause in the directive specifically for cases like this, which makes it possible to modify and tighten up the limit values at a later date, and we now need to make use of that clause. Commissioner Tajani, that was something that we also called on your predecessor to do a year ago. I am pleased that, as I understand it, the Commission is to announce today, at least, that the limit values for certain heavy metals are to be tightened up, albeit with a delay from when we called on it to do so and certainly encouraged by the debate today. In general, however, we need to review all hazardous substances, and we should not, therefore, restrict ourselves to the heavy metals. Instead, we need to look into the latest information on the hazardous substances known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Should it also turn out that it is necessary to amend the limit values in order to protect our children, I call for a rectification of the legislation in this regard, too. At the end of the day, this is about the safety of our children. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Christofer Fjellner, and his shadow rapporteurs. Under difficult conditions, and despite battling against a severe headwind, a very good result has genuinely been achieved with this report. The Commission proposal has been improved considerably. A strict ban on advertising remains: there will be no information on the radio, television or in magazines; instead, patients must actively seek out the information. I base my position on the idea that patients are responsible people. They want to be informed, and I would very much like to help them achieve that. I therefore also want the patient to be at the centre of the information. I would like to focus on two key points. I myself have said in no uncertain terms – including in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – that I would like to see health portals on the Internet and similar information in printed media. Our citizens often look things up on the Internet, where they often come across poor and uncontrolled information. We must therefore counter this with an alternative: controlled information. Pharmacovigilance was a first success, with the adoption of drug safety portals that included the package leaflets and information on the medicines. However, I would like to go beyond this, Commissioner, and would have liked to have seen comprehensive Internet portals that also provide information on illnesses and prevention. If I have understood you correctly, you support this in principle, but perhaps have not said so in this dossier. I would like the Commissioner to make a clear statement as to whether he also supports this. I consider this to be a very, very important matter. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, our heartfelt thanks go to the rapporteur. The directive on electrical and electronic equipment is highly controversial. There were great differences of opinion regarding various aspects. I am therefore pleased that agreement has been reached and at what I regard as the good result of the trialogue negotiations. I would specifically like to reiterate two points. One is the question of the scope. What equipment should the directive actually cover? There is one thing that we must not forget: originally, it was meant to cover domestic appliances – in other words, white goods. The open scope now includes many new product groups, which would also have encompassed technologies for renewable energy. I must point out that this directive actually had a quite different objective. Naturally, much stricter and higher standards of protection need to be applied in the case of domestic appliances than in the case of technologies such as those that are uninstalled, recycled, etc. by specialist personnel. That is why I, in turn, advocated the exemption of renewable energies. I was not in favour of expanding the scope, but then I saw that a majority was moving in that direction. I think it would have been counterproductive to include renewable energy in this directive. It would have resulted in a competitive disadvantage and therefore I think it is the right decision. Then I would like to say something about Annex III: I would have had concerns about including a further 37 substances as priority substances when there is no real justification on health grounds for a future ban on these. I think that would be a panic measure, and that is why I think the decision made is the right one and am pleased about this aspect of the result too. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs very much for their excellent work. Effective supervision of medical products provides protection for the citizens of Europe and, at the same time, gives more power to responsible patients. Two points in particular are very important to me: the safety web portal for medicines and the patient information leaflet (PIL). The positive news is that tomorrow’s resolution will introduce safety web portals for medicines into all the Member States, where the approved patient information leaflet and other information must be published. This will put an end to an untenable situation. In many Member States, it is not possible to publish the PIL on the web. However, this is not in line with the real lives of many citizens who make use of the right of free movement within the European Union. Now they will be able to download PILs from the web in their own language anywhere in Europe. This will also be useful for patients who have lost their PIL. At the same time, I want the PIL to be improved and I am very pleased about the resolution calling on the Commission to submit draft legislation on this subject. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, today’s good news is that the new legislation will provide uniform, mandatory nutritional labelling that relates to 100 grams, thereby providing greater comparability. Statements of nutritional value provide consumers with information that allows them to make an informed purchasing decision. The model I have in my mind is that of the responsible consumer who knows what he is buying. Imitation products that are not clearly marked as such deliberately mislead consumers. Imitation cheese, pressed ham products, vanilla yoghurt that contains no vanilla whatsoever – these are just a few examples. All these imitation products must be labelled as such. I am pleased that we will send a clear signal to the Council tomorrow and that all of us here are agreed that we need better labelling. As far as I am concerned, the task is to provide information; we should leave consumers to make up their own minds, however. That is why I am against traffic light labelling. There are no unhealthy foods – only unhealthy, unbalanced diets. The traffic lights are misleading. I am in favour of food labelling according to the GDA model and am pleased that we are likely to vote to move towards this tomorrow. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

 Mr President, consumer protection is a very, very important matter for me and therefore I am against consumers being misled or deceived in any way. This is why I am fighting for better labelling of food imitations in the Regulation on the labelling of foodstuffs, for example. I am calling on the Council to follow this approach, which is also supported by the Commission. Today, we had to vote on glued meat. Glued meat is meat which is glued together and sold as a high-quality product. In my opinion, this should not be happening, in particular, when consumers are not aware of what is going on. The decision today was not an easy one for me. The Commission has proposed comprehensive labelling rules, but consumers may still be misled, because it is difficult to prove that a product contains thrombin. This means that it may be used but not indicated on the label. Therefore, I think a labelling requirement is not sufficient in this case. I have now voted in favour of the resolution and of a ban on thrombin. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

 Mr President, the climate negotiations in Copenhagen were disappointing for the European Union, as has already been mentioned. The result was a long way from the EU position and from the position that we need to be in to protect the climate. The only positive aspect is the recognition of the two-degree goal, as this could lead to the necessary reduction commitments. We must now ask ourselves what we can learn from the failure of the negotiations and what we should do next. It is important to have a period of reflection and to take a critical look at different points on the route that we have been following. We have to ask ourselves how we can make progress jointly with other states. How can we ensure that the EU is also present at the table when the US, China and India meet to negotiate a compromise? How can we negotiate more effectively with the developing countries and emerging economies? Is it essential that these negotiations take place under the aegis of the UN? Finally, I would like to say how pleased I am that I was able to vote for the resolution, because in my opinion, it continues to emphasise the pioneering role played by the European Union. We must now answer these questions and continue on our current path, both from a domestic and an international perspective. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank you most sincerely for the clarity of your words. Essentially, it should be said that, overall, the Toys Directive has brought a considerable improvement in the protection of our children. We all approached it with the intention of producing the most stringent legislation anywhere in the world. However, many parents and grandparents are now concerned – as you said – because of the studies by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. We now need to ask ourselves whether or not the Institute’s statements and opinion are right. In any case, we need to examine the facts of the matter very closely. It is a question of the protection of our children. At this point, I would like to thank you most sincerely for having stated that you are willing to do that. However, I think that things need to move more quickly. Not until next year, you say, during the first half of the year, will the findings of the scientific committee be available. It must be done quicker than that. It is a question of the protection of our children. I really cannot understand why the Federal Institute left it so long to come out with these statements. I want to make that point here, too. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the German conservative group (CSU) would like to see clear and practical rules for the protection of non-smokers being introduced throughout Europe. However, in my opinion, ‘throughout Europe’ does not necessarily mean ‘from within Europe’. Many Member States already have in place regulations for protecting non-smokers and others are in the process of introducing regulations of this kind. I do not believe – in common with the majority of my fellow Members in the European Parliament, which is very pleasing – that we in Brussels must impose regulations for the protection of non-smokers or that we are able to do this more effectively. The European Union has no authority in this area. We are only responsible for health and safety at work. This is where the problem lies, because for me the most important issue is protecting children and young people and this group, which specifically needs protection, would not be covered by regulations that refer only to health and safety at work. Therefore, the Member States must take action in this area. I have voted in favour and I am pleased that this amendment was accepted. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
).

Madam President, we need clear and practical rules for the protection of non-smokers to be introduced throughout Europe. However, in my opinion ‘throughout Europe’ does not necessarily mean ‘from Europe’. Many Member States already have in place legislation to protect non-smokers and others are in the process of introducing laws of this kind. Why are some of my fellow Members now saying that we in Brussels can do this much better than the Member States, regardless of the fact that the European Union has no authority on health policy and that we have to implement this via the circuitous route of health and safety at work? In my opinion, the Member States should decide which regulations to put in place to protect non-smokers. This makes sense, because they are closer to the local problems and issues. I do not understand why Brussels should impose protection for non-smokers in Lapland and in Andalusia which is identical in every detail. What has happened to the cross-border implications? We in Brussels have come up against our limits in this respect. For me, protecting children and young people is particularly important. We need comprehensive protection in this area. If we introduce protection for non-smokers on a European level via health and safety at work, we are not protecting children and young people, because they are not employees. Therefore, I would ask you to support Amendments 2 and 13 put forward by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Manfred Weber,

Mr President, Vice-President Reding, Mr Mavroyiannis, ladies and gentlemen, in July, contrary to existing laws, an impartial Ombudsman who has long campaigned against corruption was replaced by a government with someone who is willing to tow the party line. Two pieces of emergency legislation were passed that drastically reduce the powers of the constitutional court and change the legal position for a referendum to suspend the president from office while the case is in progress. An extremely dubious suspension procedure was pursued against the state president that was no longer under the supervision of the constitutional court as a result of the emergency legislation. The quorum requirements of the constitutional court were ignored. Finally, there are reports of irregularities in the electoral lists for the referendum on the suspension of the office of president, indicating that the electoral lists were even changed after the ballot was complete. To cap it all: constitutional lawyers and advocates have received personal threats during the process. As I read this list, you might think I am talking about a banana republic in some obscure part of the world. However, I am, in fact, talking about reports that we received during the summer from Romania, a Member State of the European Union. These reports and the discussions we have had to hold about them are disappointing and quite simply unacceptable. I am therefore pleased and grateful that the President of the Commission and, above all, our Vice-President, Ms Reding, have responded in a committed and decisive manner, demanding an explanation from Romania. It is unacceptable, however, for Prime Minister Ponta to promise the President of the Commission that the illegal and highly undemocratic emergency legislation will be repealed, while doing nothing at home in Romania. On the contrary, Mr Ponta has exploited the opportunity to bad-mouth the European Union. This is unworthy of a democratically elected prime minister and shows a profoundly undemocratic attitude of mind. Thanks again to the Commission for its decisive stance. The citizens of Romania and of Europe as a whole appreciate this. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Manfred Weber  (PPE

 I am happy to answer this question because Mr Paşcu is surely aware that neither he, nor I, nor Prime Minister Ponta is entitled to assess whether or not a court is biased in its decisions. A constitutional court is independent and, as such, is required to reach independent decisions, which both of us need to accept. You come from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. Your party has now decided not to hold your party congress in Bucharest because all party leaders in Europe say: I refuse to be photographed with Ponta. This is the reality and this is why I would ask the social democrats to go to Bucharest and say: see to it that the rule of law is implemented. Manfred Weber,

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the discussion of Schengen has generated a lot of headlines in Europe in recent weeks. For that reason, it is good that we are discussing this matter in Parliament today. I would like to start by indicating the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for the Commissioner in respect of the examination of the very specific detailed accusations in the European Union, and if it is found that offences have been committed at European internal borders, they should be properly investigated by the Commission, because the PPE Group wants a strong European authority that will monitor Schengen status in future. That brings us to the real debate, which is one that, ultimately, concerns us all. With its decision on the Schengen rules, the Council was itself probably not altogether clear on what it was hoping to achieve, because it has not only set out on a path that we consider to be dubious in terms of content, it has also, by choosing a new legal basis, departed from the path of cooperation with Members of this House. The Council has also interfered in one of Europe’s most important achievements, namely the open borders. For us, Schengen means freedom in place of borders, cooperation in place of egoism and working together instead of working against one another. The freedom to travel in Europe is the PPE Group’s top priority. The people, the economy and indeed the whole of Europe will benefit from this. We do not want the open borders, which are a visible feature of European cooperation, to be disproportionately restricted, particularly at a time when more European spirit is needed. As the PPE Group, we want the Member States to stop doing secret deals with each other on how essential rights of their citizens are to be dealt with. This method has failed; we must focus on the Community method. The PPE Group wants the decision making to come out of the diplomatic backrooms and the decisions on these new legal bases to be made by the elected bodies in which citizens are represented. The PPE Group will fight to retain these rights in Europe. As far as the content is concerned, we do not see any insurmountable obstacles. The question is whether we will actually find a way forward in this process together. I have to say, Mr Mavroyiannis, that this is not the way for family members to treat each other. It destroys the spirit of European cooperation. We therefore ask the Council to return to the path of cooperation, and – as you said yourself today – more intensive contact is not enough for the European Parliament. We are legislators and we are involved in the decision, and for that reason I would ask you to withdraw your decision on the legal basis and involve Parliament as an equal legislator. Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we want to use the time tomorrow to discuss the current political situation in Romania, for three essential reasons. Firstly, we have all read in the newspapers that the matter at issue is a dispute about whether the Prime Minister is responsible for his doctoral thesis. His doctoral thesis is not our affair, however. Our subject instead is what is being done to the ethics commission in Romania responsible for resolving such incidents, which is a source of indignation for us – how people are being appointed ex post facto
, how the ethics commission is being padded out, in order to possibly reach different results, and also how these results are being published in the official gazette, amended between Parliament and the government, in order to be able to react as quickly as possible and to be able to water down disagreeable judgments. The second thing that bothers us is the issue of what happened to the public television service in Romania. The legal basis for public service television in Romania states that the parliamentary groups are to be represented proportionately in the monitoring committees, while the people who have now been appointed all belong to the government’s political group, which is thus a violation of the law. The third request that we have, the third consideration that bothers us, is probably the most weighty, the most difficult, which is Romania’s representation at the European Council at the end of the week. I say this as there has been a dispute between the President and the Prime Minister as to who will represent Romania at the summit. This question was put to the Romanian constitutional court, which unambiguously decided that the President is responsible for representing the country abroad. The Prime Minister, meanwhile, has rejected this decision by the constitutional court and mobilised his parliamentary group to fight back. All of these are points where we ask the question of whether a prime minister is in a position to adhere to the democratic ground rules, the ground rules according to the constitution, or whether he wants to lead his country into a constitutional crisis. (Heckling)
 We therefore ask to debate this. Those Members who were heckling should bear in mind that we, as Parliament, need to take a critical view of developments – seriously, Mr Swoboda – and not view them through our party political spectacles. We should at least have the opportunity to discuss this – no more and no less! Anyone with nothing to hide need not be afraid of a debate. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would urge that we vote now. We have had two months to discuss this subject in depth. There has been a lot of discussion between the groups. Then, in the last few days, pressure from the genetic engineering lobby was also added to the mix, and this has now caused confusion once again. We are of the opinion that we have discussed all there is to discuss and that a decision can now be taken. There are two arguments: our citizens are expecting signals from us with regard to how we are going to deal with biopatents, and the European Patent Office is also expecting clear signals from Parliament on how the current law is to be implemented. That is why we should decide today. Manfred Weber  (PPE

 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Bødskov, we should admit to each other that we are all struggling to uphold data protection for our European citizens. We should also listen seriously to what Mr Watson underlined in his short speech, namely that the fight against terrorism is a common cause and that the people who experienced the terror attack in Toulouse should also be remembered in this House. We need to weigh up both arguments. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) clearly recognises the United States of America as our partner in the global challenge that is the fight against terror. We see the US as a partner and wish to work with it. I believe that we should avoid getting involved in this role play where the US is the bad guy that wants our data, while we Europeans reap the benefits of the results of the analyses, which will, after all, also be available to the European authorities. We must all shoulder our responsibilities, which means that we Europeans must take action. Every country has the sovereign right to decide how people enter its territory and what information it requires. Just as we are in discussions on this issue with Canada and Australia, so we are now also in discussions with the US. This agreement will offer us greater legal certainty. Anyone voting against the agreement is voting for less legal certainty. These are the alternatives on offer today. I would like to thank the Commissioner for making it clear that Europe is stronger when it acts collectively and that the European Union can achieve more than 27 countries negotiating separately. The PPE Group supports partnership with the US, which is why I would like to take a look towards the future. The reason why we are discussing a framework agreement on data protection is because the interchange of data will become more important in the future. For this reason, I would also call on the US to stay at the negotiating table and to take the Europeans’ offer seriously, so that we can draw up global standards for data exchange and data protection. If we in Europe and the US manage to conclude a joint framework agreement, then there is a chance that we will be able to establish global standards. This would represent genuine added value for the citizens of Europe. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Weber, Manfred  (PPE

 Mr Tavares, any criminal investigator working in the fight against terrorism will tell you that it is never one item of information that solves a case, but rather the overall picture built up. It is a question of how terror funds itself. It is a question of who has had phone contact with a terrorist. That is why we need to discuss data retention. It is also a question of the movement profile of a terrorist or possible perpetrator. The overall picture is what counts. I never claimed that just one data record would provide a result. What I did say, however, is that we need to uphold the data protection interests of our citizens, while at the same time considering what authority and what data we need to give to criminal investigators to enable them to do their job, namely to foil future terror attacks. Careful consideration is needed here. Those who reject the agreement today must also respect the fact that some data will simply remain unavailable. I said nothing more.

 Mr Albrecht, when I speak with criminal investigators, they tell me that we would have been unable to uncover a whole host of activities ahead of terrorist acts if it were not for our partnership with the US. This is what criminal investigators tell me. It is for this reason that I say that the United States of America is a partner of Europe in the joint war against terror. As I believe the United States to be a fair partner, I am happy to sit down with it to hammer out an agreement. This does not give carte blanche
 to all the countries of the world. If you are implying that we would equate our partnership with the United States with a partnership with China, then I am afraid I must disagree with you. I regard the United States as a true partner. I believe that this agreement will strengthen the Commission’s capacity to monitor the US and what it does with these data and whether it plays by the rules in implementing what has been agreed between us. I want a strong Europe. I also accept the United States as a fair partner that wishes to join us in the joint fight against terror.

 Unlawful? This question can be evaluated in political terms. You seem to disagree with me on this. If we take a look at the agreement, we have an organisation that has the right of initiative when it comes to negotiating an agreement and the resources to evaluate it, namely the Commission. The Commission’s legal services have stated that the agreement is in order. This is the legal situation. If others disagree, whether fellow Members of the House, Member States, or European governments, then they are completely at liberty to take the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union and to have it examined there. That is our legal system. I have absolutely no problem with that. However, to imply that a person is contradicting the law, despite the fact that the Commission’s legal services’ indicate that it is in order, is taking things too far. If this agreement is rejected, I am inclined to ask myself how you intend to explain to our citizens that we will find ourselves in a legal vacuum in which the United States will negotiate directly with the airlines and possibly even with the individual Member States. How will you explain to citizens that there are no longer any ground rules in relation to this data exchange issue. That is the issue facing us right now. Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have principles in the European Union, including the independence of the judiciary and the central bank and fundamental democratic rights. If there are any doubts about these fundamental rights or principles, we need to discuss them. The right place for these discussions is here in the European Parliament. For this reason, I would like to emphasise specifically how grateful I am to Mr Orbán, the Prime Minister of Hungary, for coming here. He was not invited. He said: I will take part in the discussion, because we have nothing to hide. I would like to emphasise too that Mr Orbán is here and is listening while many of those Members who were so hysterical and dramatic that they could hardly contain themselves have obviously already left the Chamber. He is still here and we should acknowledge that. If we leave the party politics to one side, the facts are quite simple: Europe has ground rules which apply to all of us. The job of the Commission is to ensure that everyone follows these rules and that is what it has done. The Hungarian Government has already promised on several occasions to deal with these problems and to make the necessary changes. These are the facts. If we could simply put aside the political hysteria, then we would be able to talk objectively about the situation. I have heard nothing new today from those on the left concerning the facts. Mr Swoboda stands up and says that the judiciary may be independent. Then I hear from Mr Orbán that there was absolutely no criticism of the constitution. Next Mr Verhofstadt says that this is not about individual legal details. It is about the fundamental question of whether Hungary is still democratic. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) stand for law and justice. If anyone has a criticism, they must substantiate it objectively and in terms of its content with regard to the judicial issues and not simply claim that someone has acted undemocratically. What we are experiencing in many areas is quite simply an arbitrary approach. If I do not like a specific aspect of the legislation in Hungary, I describe it as undemocratic, radical and right-wing or totalitarian. We in the PPE Group will not tolerate this. Finally, I would like to say that I have been working in this Parliament since 2004. I was involved with the case of Slovakia, which introduced a law banning the use of the Hungarian language there. All of the people on the left who are now getting so angry … (Heckling)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that is precisely the method which is preventing us from discussing the situation objectively. Personal attacks and defamatory statements are being made with regard to the subjects under discussion. I have no doubts about my fellow Member Mr Szájer and I have no reservations about his wife, although I do not know her. Also I would like to say that if we are really taking parliaments and parliamentarianism seriously, then the European Parliament must take seriously the decisions of the Hungarian Parliament, which has the support of a two-thirds majority of the citizens. This should also be taken into account in the discussion. (Applause) Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Swoboda, saying rather offensively as an Austrian and as Chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament that you are motivated by love of Hungary and then saying to the Prime Minister of the freely elected Hungarian Parliament that you are doing this out of love, I personally find rather impertinent. You are insinuating that the freely elected Prime Minister is not doing things out of love. Therefore, I would like to ask you how you come to say that you are acting only out of love of Hungary. I believe that the freely elected Prime Minister is also acting out of love. Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, two weeks ago, the European Council met. After the summit, the Heads of State or Government appeared before the media and told the citizens of Europe how proud they were of Schengen and that they would defend Schengen against the attacks on it. When I heard these statements from our leading EU politicians, I thought to myself, ‘how bad have things got that it is now viewed as a success to defend Schengen?’ Schengen was a given that we had created in Europe, yet suddenly it is up for discussion again. The key question is how can we deal with the popularism we can sense on the Right? I think we need to take a two-pronged approach. The first element is that we need to convince people again that the project is right. We need to answer the assertion that security is improved through the introduction of border controls by explaining that it was only with the introduction of the Schengen Information System, through partnership and cooperation, that security was improved. I live in the border area between Bavaria and the Czech Republic. In my area, security has improved since border controls were abolished, as we now work with the Czech authorities. Even before abolishing the border controls, we have had more success in fighting crime in Romania and Bulgaria simply thanks to the exchange of information within the framework of the Schengen Information System. We need to convince people and win them back to the project. We need to win their hearts and I would like to see the Commission do more in this regard. Commissioner Malmström yesterday went on record saying that there had not been any problems so far in Denmark. While she may have been legally accurate, she offered too little political argument. We are not fighting for the hearts and minds of the people at this point in the way we should be. As Parliament, we can reassure the citizens that we take the Treaty of Lisbon seriously. We shall defend the Schengen agreement against all attacks that it may face with all the power we have as MEPs. If the Schengen acquis
 is to be amended, we shall ensure that it emerges from the changes stronger rather than weaker. Manfred Weber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the European Parliament is a very hard-working body, however we need to pay more attention to a balance in the voting times, so that we do not have a situation where there is nothing to vote on one day and an enormous number of votes the next. That is why I am now proposing that we should stop voting now and defer the remaining business to the next plenary sitting. (Applause)
 There are no issues on the agenda that are so pressing that a vote is absolutely necessary today. We have already voted on the legislative points. I believe that this was the most important thing for now. (Applause) Manfred Weber  (PPE

– (DE)
 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, a lot has already been said with regard to Greece. I would just like to add two thoughts on this matter. The first is that, despite all the concern and fear being felt by the people, we must not lose sight of the principles. The two principles that define Europe are solidarity – we stand by this – and a sense of individual responsibility – that the Greek people and all those who receive acts of solidarity also take responsibility themselves. The second thought is that mention has been made of the big test for Europe and of the concern that the project could perhaps even fail and that old ghosts that we had thought we had eradicated could return to the European Union. I would like to turn all of this around and look at it in a positive light. We should not just talk about the problems, but also about the successes. For example, we should mention that some of the Baltic States have managed to overcome the crisis and that, with European support, Ireland will succeed in returning to the bond markets next year. This could also be a big opportunity to prove to the people that we are stronger together than we are alone. In this context, it is quite difficult to deal with the second major issue for the Council meeting, namely that of migration. However, there is a nice link that connects the two issues, because in relation to the migration issue, in particular Schengen, we also see the same principle at work, namely that one of Europe’s major successes is now being called into question as a result of national egotism. I am sure that we have all seen the figures indicating that 18 000 refugees have arrived in Italy. However, we all know that, for Italy, 18 000 refugees is hardly an excessive burden, because twice as many refugees have been received in the last year in Belgium alone. It was therefore not right of Italy to react in the way that it did. It was internal policymaking by Italy’s minister of reforms, Umberto Bossi. On account of a few hundred people, France responded by reintroducing border controls, and that, too, was for domestic political reasons. In Denmark, too, the reasons were of an internal political nature. I would therefore like clear signals to be sent out from the Council meeting. When the question of migration and Schengen is discussed, the Heads of State or Government of the European Union must respond with the clear message that we do not want national egotism, in particular in this area. Instead we want to defend the huge success that is a free Europe. Mr Barroso, you will certainly have Parliament’s support in that. Manfred Weber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, fundamental human rights are universal, which means that they are applicable in every situation. I have been listening to the debate. None of the speakers so far, including the critics, has quoted the constitution to indicate exactly what it is they do not like. Mr López Aguilar says that he gets the impression that something has gone awry, while others are making insinuations about all the things that could go wrong with this constitution. Not one person has actually quoted from the constitution itself. That is precisely the problem that faces us in this discussion: where are the actual accusations? When I consider how the Hungarians will react to this debate and to the accusations being bandied about by some of my fellow Members without any support from direct quotations, then I can well imagine that some will find the way that the Hungarians and their country’s development are being discussed here to be extremely arrogant. As Europeans, we should take care to avoid leaving ourselves open to such accusations. I would like to state that many of those in positions of responsibility in Hungary today are the people who took to the streets to fight against communism and for liberty. It is simply unacceptable that accusations should be continuously made against these people and that the impression should be created that they are experiencing problems with freedom. This has nothing to do with party politics; it is simply a fact. Having complained that no quotes have been used during this debate, I would now like to quote from the new Hungarian constitution: ‘We are proud of the fact that our country has been part of Christian Europe for 1 000 years and we are aware of the role of Christianity in sustaining our nation’. I am pleased to find such sentiments in a constitution. This may not please all Members of this House. I am pleased that this reference to Christianity has been included and I would also have liked to have seen it included in the Treaty of Lisbon and in the European constitution. My position, as a representative of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is that this is a good thing. Manfred Weber  (PPE

Madam President, Mr Alvaro, you have just demonstrated how to extend your speaking time by accepting numerous questions. However, I would like to ask you whether you are aware that the provisions for the Hungarian constitutional court – I am not sure whether you have read the Hungarian constitution in its entirety – are almost identical to those that apply to the constitutional court in Germany. Therefore, I wanted to ask you whether the German constitutional court is just as undemocratic and worthy of criticism as the Hungarian constitutional court? I would like to hear your answer to this question. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, allow me to begin with a smile as I congratulate all the Members for having survived the fire alarm and managing to take our places, safe and sound, back in the Chamber. As a representative of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to pose a question to the President of the Commission, who has been busy dealing with the pictures that we have been seeing in recent weeks from the Mediterranean, where many people fleeing from the situation in Africa have made it to Europe, while some have also failed to make it. We have had to see the images of these stranded and dead people on the news. We are all aware that it is a joint European challenge facing us to find an answer to this drama and this misery for refugees. On behalf of the PPE Group, I would like to ask the President of the Commission to give us an appraisal of whether the Commission – and, above all, Frontex – has enough resources, whether we, the European Union, have enough capabilities to respond on the ground, and whether we have enough statutory bases to enable Europe to act together in the Mediterranean region. I would also be interested to hear what form the discussions with the countries of origin (Tunisia and Egypt, for example) take and whether we Europeans are making headway in this area. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, my thanks for your assessments of the situation. Given that you state that we currently need more resources for Frontex, I would be interested to hear whether you are not also of the opinion that the Member States have hitherto been too unwilling to provide the resources to make Frontex strong. We did have the toolbox already. Was it the case that there was too little willingness on the part of the Member States to support Frontex accordingly? Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group
. – (DE)
 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, as has already been emphasised, Schengen is one of the great achievements of our common European project. Citizens notice it on a daily basis when travelling around Europe. It is the realisation of the dream of Europe – a Europe without border controls. It must therefore first be made clear in this debate – particularly in view of the debate that has taken place in recent weeks – that we in this House will jointly ensure that this principle and the idea behind it are not derailed by any initiative or any debate. We will defend this principle in the European Parliament. In recent weeks there have been discussions concerning more than 25 000 refugees from Tunisia who have arrived in the Italian territory of Lampedusa. Yet a country such as Sweden has been accepting more than 25 000 people a year for years on end. There have been states that have accommodated much greater numbers of people relative to their own population that is currently happening on the southern border of Europe, yet nobody has ever thought of questioning Schengen because of the burden. I would therefore like to clearly stress at this stage that it is a pity that we seriously need to have a debate in Europe, of all places, on Schengen status as a result of this challenge that we must deal with together. Secondly, I should like to make it clear that we practise solidarity. When it comes to countries such as Malta – a small country that is massively affected and which has no hinterland – then we are currently practising solidarity. In addition to this solidarity, however, I should like to stress that the second basic principle is the responsibility that the countries themselves have. I must therefore also ask the Commission to look more into this. If courts in the European Union are now ruling that Dublin II is to be ineffective – in other words, that refugees are not to be deported to their states of first arrival – then we must ask the Commission how committed it will be to taking action against those states that are obviously not currently implementing the existing law. We are talking here about minimum standards in the European Union. I am therefore calling on the Commission to take action here, too. As regards the preparation for the Council, I have just three points to make. The first is that when it comes to migration then naturally we must expect more migration in the long term as a result of demographic change, but here in the European Union we currently have 24 million people without work and in Spain the youth unemployment rate is 30%. We should therefore proceed cautiously – very cautiously – when it comes to the issue of migration. My second point concerns strengthening Frontex, as has already been mentioned. My third point is that I would ask us all to ensure that those states that were about to join Schengen, namely Bulgaria and Rumania, are not left behind because of the current debate. They have done the work; they have made efforts. We are not asking for lower standards for joining, but if they meet the standards then it is only fair that Bulgaria and Rumania also have the right to become members of the Schengen area.

Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, transparency is a cornerstone of democracy, ensuring that people know who exerts influence and how decisions are made. Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament has significantly more power. That is why it is right that our modus operandi
 should always be open to debate and that we should question ourselves. The negotiations between the European Parliament and the Commission in relation to the transparency register are a success and we have now produced an excellent result. I would like to underline once again that it is good that we have found clear regulations for the local and regional authorities, and even for churches, that reflect their interests. I would also like to say that we do not regard lobbyism as something bad per se. We need expert opinions and we need to be able to call on experts for our work. In the end it is important that we, as parliamentarians, should be able to consider issues freely and make decisions independently. I would now like to state that we parliamentarians have a lot to be proud of. If we conduct a national comparison, we will see that there are only a few Member States of the European Union who have already established a transparency register at this level. In my country’s capital, Berlin, where I also happen to live, there is no such transparency register, which is why we should all be aware that this is a truly significant step forward. To the Council I would say: if this issue is not a problem for the Council because lobbyists have very little influence there, then it should be easier for it to sign up to the transparency register. Accordingly, the Council may be able to conquer its internal resistance. Finally, Madam President, I would point out that if we in Parliament want to escape the influence of lobbyists to a greater extent in future, then we will need greater supports and more staff, enabling us to achieve more for the citizens of the European Union.

Mr President, Mr Barroso, the necessary Treaty modification and the institutional debate that we are holding both demonstrate that, now the Treaty of Lisbon has been in force for just over a year, we can no longer resolve the challenges which the world is presenting us with by means of the Treaty as it currently stands. That is exactly what today’s debate shows. On the other hand, when we talk about the current Treaty, we are told that a wider debate about the Treaty is inconceivable and futile in the light of the situation in the Member States and, in particular in the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic. That is the conflict which we currently find ourselves in. We need more, but we will not be getting it from the Member States. The European Parliament must provide an answer. If we listen to what the citizens are saying today, it is clear that they are aware that we need to introduce changes to the Treaty now. They are asking questions like: ‘How are we going to get the markets under control in the near future?’. This is why we need a strong Europe. However, we must ask ourselves an even more important question, which is: What good is our European project doing at the end of the day? For decades, it has been responsible for peacekeeping and for bringing war on our continent to an end. This morning, I was host to a group of visitors from a school. For young people, war is, thank goodness, no longer an issue. They cannot imagine what war might be like. In our discussions, we now raise the threat of globalisation and explain that we need Europe to keep the evil of globalisation under control, but this is a negative argument. If we want to win over not only the minds, but also the hearts of the people, we must take a step further on the question of what good the European project is doing. We must talk about the pictures and ask ourselves what Europe is achieving and what its job is. When the powerful countries in the world come together, including America, Japan, Europe, Brazil, India and so on, who will raise their hand and ask whether we are paying enough attention to social issues? China will not do so. We will have to do that ourselves. Who will raise their hand and say ‘We need to think about environmental questions’? The Americans will not do that. We will have to highlight the issue. Who will say ‘We want to maintain peace throughout the world and ensure that conflicts do not turn into wars’? We will have to do this with our historical experience. If we look at Tunisia, it is clear that the people there want the same model which we have in Europe. We have a highly attractive way of life. Therefore, when we discuss Treaty issues, when we talk about the way in which our continent functions and the job that we have to do, we must look at the big picture, so that we win not only the minds, but also the hearts of people for our project. Then, we will succeed in gaining acceptance for it at a national level. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule149(8)) Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, on the one hand, it is important that the Member States are in control of the treaties, which is why the modification must take place at this level. On the other hand, we are faced with the question which is implicit in many of the questions that I have attempted to address. Are we reflecting carefully on this, are we taking enough time and being allowed enough time to discuss everything in detail? Or are people’s expectations so high and the pressure of the global challenges so great that we need to be quicker and to act more quickly? For this reason, I do not regard the issue of time as a problem, but we do need to provide answers. We must focus on that. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, asylum policy is a highly topical issue, as we have recently discovered in Lampedusa and in Greece. It is a subject that concerns the people of Europe. We should be proud of what we have achieved in Europe, including our common standards, the proper processing of asylum applications and our way of dealing with children and families. We should be proud of all of this. Europe is an area which offers help and partnership to people suffering persecution all over the world. However, the decisive factor is not what we put on paper in Parliament’s committees, in the Commission and in the Council, but what actually happens on the ground. Belgium and Greece have recently been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for not implementing and not adhering to existing legislation. This makes it clear that the enforcement process is not working. I would like to ask the Commission to make faster progress, alongside its existing action plans. We need to be able to put in place and implement the important standards more quickly within the European Union. In the specific case of Greece, I would like to point out that we have a border that can be secured from both sides. I am disappointed in the way our partner, Turkey, has behaved in this respect. We have signed a readmission agreement with Turkey, which requires the country to do far less than it would have to if it were a member of the European Union. Therefore, I think we should expect Turkey to make a greater effort in this area. No one disputes our sense of solidarity. We want to provide practical help in the form of the European Refugee Fund and Frontex, both in the case of Greece, where aid is already being provided, and in the case of Lampedusa in Italy. European solidarity is not being called into question. It is needed now more than it ever has been. Manfred Weber,  
author.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would also like to use today’s debate to take a general look at the visa policy of the European Union. Firstly, it is important to emphasise, to make ourselves aware, of the great value of this visa policy to the European Union. Since we are a common Europe, a common space for people, we are able to create a common visa policy. Our visa policy is therefore also a sign of European unity – a very successful sign of European unity – and it is important to point that out, particularly in times of crisis. Secondly, we are calling for clear rules of play when it comes to visa facilitation. The technical standards that are to be maintained – at external borders and when issuing passports and identity papers – are clearly set out. We cannot make any political concessions as regards the upholding of these standards. In 2010, we found that in the Balkans, there was initially a focus on technical standards, but political arguments were then advanced with increasing vigour. When it comes to visa facilitation, however, one cannot stop at one country; we have to view the area as a whole. Yes, it is always difficult for us to weigh things up in an individual case. However, the core of the issue is that the technical standards must be upheld; the criteria must remain. I therefore also support our Commissioner when she says that these standards that we are demanding must also be implemented in reality. That is an important task of the Commission, because only then will our visa policy be accepted by our citizens. Thirdly, I would like to mention that we welcome the fact that the last European Justice and Home Affairs Council discussed enabling visa facilitation to be rapidly lifted or withdrawn from individual states if they fail to implement the standards. The example of Serbia showed us that the result was a great influx of asylum seekers. Moving on to my final point, for the time being – when talking about Ukraine and Russia – our group is highly sceptical as regards opening the doors quickly, because we have just seen in the case of Serbia that there will also be negative effects. We should therefore proceed with great caution when it comes to visa policy. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, on the subject of Pakistan: we are debating this at a difficult time for Pakistan, and all of us, I believe, support complete solidarity with the people there who have suffered this disaster. Mr Sógor has already talked specifically about the agreement. Therefore, I would like to make a few comments on the questions relating to European Union readmission agreements with third countries in general. Firstly, these agreements make sense and they are necessary, because we have legislation in Europe that governs immigration. However, if we have legislation that governs immigration then there will also be people who are residing here illegally. It then follows logically that we also need to have repatriation. With regard to many of the principles I have just stated, the Left – the Socialists – are often on our side, but when it comes to specific decisions regarding the actual conclusion of such an agreement, they then refuse to give their consent. I therefore believe that, despite this, we need to remain consistent. Secondly, standard human rights must be respected. The alternative to such an agreement is not, of course, that we have better human rights standards. Anyone who rejects this agreement accepts the fact that we will have 27 different legal standards in the European Union which are not monitored as closely as would be the case at European level. The third, and for me the most important, question is: how can we actually make partnership with third countries attractive in future? I would ask the Commission to work in a more interconnected way in future. If we open up European markets in the world trade negotiations, the third countries must also give us the opportunity to talk about repatriation or, with regard to the question of legal immigration, third countries must be in a position to grant us concessions in connection with repatriation. In other words, a more interconnected way of working is important here. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was no coincidence that we, as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), allowed our colleague, Mrs Járóka, who is the only representative of the Roma minority in this Parliament, to speak first today. This is because the PPE Group would much prefer to talk about the people’s problems today. We do not want to make a political show – we do not care about Mr Sarkozy – we want to discuss the problems we are facing with the Roma minority and how we can help them. This is also the basis of our resolution. Mr Swoboda, you said that it is scandalous that the Commission has drawn this conclusion. All I can say to that is that it is clearly scandalous to you because the Commission is not joining in with the political show that you want to make of this and has made a serious comment on the situation. Secondly, as regards the freedom of movement, everything has been said already. We have clear ground rules in the European Union. The freedom of movement is not without limit; it can be restricted on an individual basis and that is also what has been done in France. My third point is actually the important one. In the political debate on this issue, it is a question of how we can integrate the minorities in Europe into our societies. If we all accept the fact that we are open-minded and tolerant, then we are on common ground. If, as a second step, we also all accept that around 90% move towards the majority society, that we really join together and take integration seriously, then we are also still in agreement. We are divided on the question of how we should deal with migrants – regardless of what sort of migrants – who just do not accept what the majority society has to offer, who refuse to cooperate, and will not accept the ground rules. The Left in this House repeatedly presents the argument that we need to offer these people something. We in the PPE Group say that the migrants also need to accept the offers. If you do not add this requirement and stipulate it in strong terms, if you do not have a state that calls for this, then you destroy the willingness of citizens to integrate people, and you do the handiwork of the Right in this House if you do not permit the state to use this toughness. It is also permissible to say that. (Applause)

 Mr President, thank you for the question. The answer is also quite simple. The question of whether a law has been transposed is not decided in Europe by politicians, or by journalists. In the European Union, it is the courts that decide. In the European Union – and in France, too – we have a situation in which people belonging to the Roma groups concerned can turn to the courts and file a complaint against this on an individual basis. That has already been done. The Commissioner has pointed out that French judges also use European law as the basis for their decisions. Thus, it is not journalists who decide whether or not laws have been implemented in this European Union, it is the courts, and according to the Commission’s statement, that is clearly the way it works in France just as it does in the other Member States of the European Union. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to talk about freedom of expression in the European Union is to cover a broad subject area. I thank the Commission for the broad approach to this matter. This is a debate about principles. From my own country, Germany, I can report that one political party, a political power, namely the Social Democrats, owns newspapers and publishing houses, in other words, it has large newspapers under its control. We citizens repeatedly ask ourselves whether it is good for parties to own parts of the media or whether it would actually be better for these two to be separate. Thus, there is a great deal to discuss with regard to this issue. However, I would like to use today’s debate to talk instead about principles. The media are part of the foundation of our democracy. They inform people of factual circumstances and they scrutinise those who hold power. Of course, this task performed by the media also brings with it a large responsibility to use this power in a responsible manner. In this regard, it is important to protect peoples’ privacy and it is important that news is not reported in order to create a sensation, but to provide reliable information. In that respect, the media are part of the foundation of our civil democracy. Independence is what is most important here. Publishers must grant their journalists independence. In the national structures that we have – we as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) view this as positive, because the media are also part of our culture – we need independence from political influence, and neither must advertising customers influence the work of editorial staff. If we take a look at the reality of journalism today, one of the greatest challenges for independent journalism is probably the subject of the Internet, in other words, the ability to access information on the Internet free of charge without knowing whether this information is correct or incorrect. That is a major challenge. In order to maintain high quality journalism, which we need to ensure, even in the age of the Internet, we must uphold the copyright of the journalists who supply high quality work. This is a key challenge for the future. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, different types of fruit take differing amounts of time to ripen. I can say on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) that our fruit is ripe for decision making and, therefore, we would like to vote on the Gallo report and come to a decision on it this week. Manfred Weber,

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, in its session today, the Commission approved the new SWIFT agreement, and did so by a large majority or even unanimously. I would like to ask the President of the Commission – since I am sure he is aware that many of our citizens are concerned about data being passed on – where he sees substantial progress and how we can convince our citizens of the necessity of this agreement. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I just have a brief supplementary question. It concerns the content of the agreement that you have presented. I would like to repeat my previous question. What are the implications of this agreement for transatlantic relations? How important is it for the other topics that we need to discuss with the US? If you could give us an idea of this, I would be very grateful. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).  
– (DE) 
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr López Garrido, I too would firstly like to make a short comparison with the SWIFT debate. I was quite delighted to hear the representative of the Council talk of dedicated objectives in negotiations for this new SWIFT agreement. I am therefore quite surprised by the sort of effect and power the Treaty of Lisbon and the statement by Parliament have had on the Council, which now wants to champion the interests of Europe. I hope that we experience the same momentum now when we are talking about Passenger Name Record data, and that here there is also a commitment to fighting on behalf of European interests. Secondly, I would like to say that I believe we all agree that from the point of view of legal certainty for both airlines and citizens, when it is a question of data protection rights, such agreements make sense. The standards that we want have been set out clearly in the joint resolution. Thirdly, I would like to mention a point that is not directly connected with the agreements, but definitely relates to the subject, in other words, the debate in the Council as to whether we also need or should develop a European PNR system. The last major terror threat in Europe was the Detroit case when an attacker boarded a plane and wanted to fly to Detroit. That happened last year before Christmas. In this case, we learned that in the United Kingdom, we knew that this person was a threat. However, those who decided whether he could fly or not did not have the necessary information to hand. What I want to say here is that I believe that in the European Union, the problem is not whether there is enough data available. I believe that we already know who poses a threat. The problem is getting the data to where we need it in order to prevent threats. In Toledo, the Spanish Presidency proposed – and I am grateful for this – that we strengthen the networking of counter terrorism authorities in Europe. Unfortunately, this proposal was not taken up by the European interior ministers. Instead, there was the proposal to build new data sets and gather new data. It often seems to me that for the interior ministers, collecting new data is the easy option. I would firstly ask you to attend to the networking of the authorities involved; then we would achieve a lot in the fight against terror. Manfred Weber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schulz said that Greece has delivered and that it is now Europe’s turn. I wonder whether Europe actually needs to say ‘thank you’, nowadays, if Member States in the euro area simply keep to the rules, in other words, if they manage to get back to the 3% criterion. I also wonder what the difference was last year when Ireland faced the same situation and instituted hard cuts. Nobody came forward at that time with the idea of calling on a European Monetary Fund. Mr Verhofstadt says that speculators are at work. Clearly there is pressure in that regard at the moment, but the fact is that Greece enjoyed major rate advantages thanks to being in the euro area. Our Italian colleagues used the rate advantage they gained from their accession to the euro area to consolidate. Greece consumed it. We can indeed therefore say that the good European today is not the one who is putting his or her money on the table; the good European is the one who actually implements the rules that everyone has signed up to and accepted, so that they are actually complied with in the European Union. As a second point, I would like to give my backing to the Commission because the proposals that are on the table for the long-term future represent a move in the right direction. We have agreed the 3% and we therefore need a strong Commission that will, in future, monitor and also enforce that 3% limit. We have seen how the Member States in the euro area are unable to police each other and to observe the 3% limit on their own. That is why I am in favour of a strong Commission that will be able, in future, to see that the criteria are met. I have one more thought. We should talk positively about the euro. It is not a currency crisis that we have; it is an economic crisis. The euro is a major benefit for everyone. If our leaders in the European Union no longer say that, if that point is no longer made in the Council, people will not know it. That is why I am in favour of this major, strong currency. Manfred Weber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, that is very helpful. Thank you very much for making this possible. If I have understood things correctly, because this is a sensitive issue that we are discussing, then Mr Rubalcaba cannot assure us that the existing agreement will not come into force. In other words, if we postpone matters and give ourselves more time, it will come into effect. Therefore, my next question is: Can Mr Rubalcaba assure us that, for example, a long-term agreement will be in place within a month with higher standards or is the Council telling us that we must still wait nine months until the end of the period? It is very hard for Parliament to accept an unconditional assurance. Therefore, we must have clear conditions relating to the Council’s assurance, in order to be able to decide tomorrow about a possible postponement. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mr Rubalcaba, Commissioners, I am pleased that we are not only talking about SWIFT and body scanners today, but also having a general debate on the war on terror, because this is a subject that affects us all. Looking back, we have to say that terrorism is a real threat to the people of Europe. We are taking positive action and I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the public authorities. The people who are responsible for security have done a good job over recent years. I would also like to thank our partners. Now we must look to the future. What will we be faced with over the next few years? In this respect, I have three specific requests or proposals. The first concerns cooperation among the authorities in Europe. Every document comes with a headline emphasising the importance of collaborating and strengthening our cooperation. These are wonderful words, but nothing has happened in practice. Once again nothing happened in Toledo with regard to practical cooperation. There is no lack of action – this has been made clear in Detroit. What we are lacking is cooperation between the authorities. That is where the problem lies. Therefore, I would like to ask the Council finally to do its job in this area and to call on the Commission to put some appropriate proposals on the table. My second point is that we should investigate our existing legislation with regard to the collection of data and mobile phone data, for example, in the case of the retention of data. For this reason, you have the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for this evaluation. After an interval of a few years, it is important to put it to the test. Thirdly, we have just had a discussion about SWIFT. I would like to ask the House why our cooperation with the United States has to be organised in this way. It has to be organised like this because we Europeans are not in the position to evaluate the data ourselves. Therefore, the question arises as to whether we are self-confident enough to evaluate it ourselves. This is another thought for the future. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr López Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, this whole debate was, of course, initially coloured by the frustration and irritation that many people in the European Parliament felt because we had the impression that, once again, things were being rushed through in the Council before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. For that reason, I am now thankful that the Council has realised that it is good to consult Parliament, to now apply the new Treaty of Lisbon in the ratification process and also to give us the opportunity to assess whether this agreement is to be applied or not. In this legislative process, if we now start it, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will apply clear decision-making criteria. There are two sides to the coin. On one side, we as the PPE Group hold the clear principle that for European data – wherever this is stored – European data protection standards should apply. We hold the principle that we want a right of appeal for people who feel they have been unfairly treated in being subjected to data checks. We hold the basic principle that data should be passed on only in individual cases and only if the person is suspected of something, not simply as a general rule. These are things that we regard as important. On the other side of the coin, there is the fact that we, of course, want cooperation with the United States. We want to cooperate with our partners in the fight against terror. We do not want a situation in which individual states – if agreements expire – are put under particular pressure, like Belgium for example, because then states might start to operate on a bilateral basis. Careful consideration is also needed here. As the PPE Group, we will give consideration to this when the legislative proposal is presented. I would ask the Council and the Commission once again not to play for time, but to send the text now so that we can deal with it. As Parliament, we are capable of working quickly and we will be able to deal with this quickly. Then it will be up to the ministers – and just to make this very clear: the interior ministers – to convince Parliament that these methods that are now being proposed in this agreement really are necessary for the fight against terror. We are open to this process, but the task of convincing us is still to be done by the executive, in other words the ministers. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).  
– (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to look at the procedural argument. I would like to remind everyone that we have just voted on the Cashman report. This is a report created by Parliament in the course of an ongoing legislative procedure. Our Legal Service has stated that this is not permitted, but the socialists insisted on introducing it. While we were discussing the freedom of the press in Italy and the Commissioner responsible explained that the European Union has no authority in this area, the socialists still felt that it was worthwhile to attack Berlusconi. Whenever it suits the socialists, it is a question of there being no authority. Whenever other people are being opposed, the authority is in place. For this reason, we should not give in to them. However, the second argument is worthy of serious discussion. Are we responsible for the Convention on Human Rights? I would like to remind my fellow Members that, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union will become party to the Convention on Human Rights. This means that if it is legitimate for the Italian Parliament to discuss this, because Italy is party to the Convention on Human Rights, then it is also legitimate for the European Parliament to discuss this, as it will be party to the Convention on Human Rights in future. My third and final argument concerns the fact that we are not lawyers, we are politicians. This judgment affects millions of people and, therefore, we should vote on it today. (Applause) Manfred Weber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, I am grateful for the opportunity to hold this debate. Mr López Aguilar referred to the fact that in his opinion, as a lawyer, we are not responsible. I am not speaking as a lawyer, but as a politician. Millions of people in Europe are affected by this judgment by the judges in Strasbourg. This is why it is a good thing that we are discussing it here. The relationship between church and state in Europe has always been disputed and has led to bloody conflicts. It is right and proper that the European Union has managed to separate the state from religion. This is a good thing. However, we have a wide range of different models in Europe. France is clearly a non-religious state, while in Great Britain, the Head of State, the Queen, is also the head of the church. We have different models of how the relationship between church and state has developed. For this reason, I believe it is a good thing that we are calling for subsidiarity in this area and that every country can go its own way. I would even like to take things a step further. I do not want to talk about subsidiarity, but about the basic issue that, from my perspective, the European values of solidarity, subsidiarity and freedom are unthinkable without a foundation in Christianity and in the Judaeo-Christian understanding of religion. Why do we not find these values in China or in the Middle East? This is because they are based on our culture and our religions. It is possible to mention this without forcing anyone to accept the same faith. We are proud of our religious freedom. There is religious freedom in the sense that it is possible for me to decide to be an atheist. That is acceptable and legitimate and we have fought for this. However, there is also the right to have a faith. In my region, where more than one million people live, over 80% are Catholics. Just as atheists call for others to show them tolerance, so the Catholics who make up more than 80% of the population are calling for non-believers to be tolerant of their faith. They want to be able to show their faith in public, to represent it and to have Christian symbols accepted by the minority in this majority society. This is also legitimate in terms of religious freedom. Anyone who calls for tolerance must also show tolerance to those who practise a Christian faith. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, I have been here in the European Parliament for 5 years now, and I work in the field of internal affairs and the law. Today, therefore, is a day of joy for me, when we have the opportunity to debate the programmes for the next five years, when we will be able to deliberate on this future as a European Parliament on an equal legislative footing. We are discussing a dossier, a subject area, that exercises the public, where the public expect answers from us, where they even say that this is an area where we need more Europe. That is not so for every subject area, but in this case it is. They are making demands of us. They want answers from us. I therefore want to very briefly describe the change that will result from the new working basis and these subjects. The first point is working with the Council. We always have representatives of the Council here and they always tell us, as Presidents-in-Office of the Council, that Parliament is very important and that we must work together. When they leave that role, however, that understanding often crumbles away. It will be our job, as parliamentarians, to demand of the Council that it no longer allow this understanding to slip away, or for it – as with the SWIFT agreement, for example – to create precedents, despite not involving us here in Parliament in the approval process. That cannot, and in future, will not, be the situation any longer. It was a bad example of the institutions taking each other seriously. My second point is that we must be creators of ideas. The new treaty gives us the opportunity to table legislative initiatives. If we want to strengthen Frontex, we cannot just call for things to happen and just make proposals, we must also put legislation on the table. In future, we will have the opportunity to do that. My third point is that we also need to be a serious partner, one that does not just draw up wish lists. If, for example, we are dealing with the fight against illegal migration, we must not just take on NGO positions, we must be a serious partner. Finally, the European Parliament must take subsidiarity seriously. If we have competence, we must also consider which subject areas would be better dealt with at the national or regional level. These are four subjects that I think are important for the forthcoming few years. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would have liked the proposals for the Stockholm Programme to have been much more ambitious still, but today is a day to rejoice that we are entering this new phase, and all that remains to be said is let us get on with the work! Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group. 
– (DE) 
Mr President, I should like to support and speak in favour of the motion. Not every issue in Europe is an issue for Europe. We practise subsidiarity and we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) have confidence in our colleagues in the parliament in Rome and trust in the Roman courts, in the Italian courts, which can rule independently on what is good for Italy and what is not good for Italy. The Italian parliament has just proven that it is independent. We are happy to debate freedom of opinion, but then we should also debate freedom of opinion in the European Union. That must be clear in the motion and its title, which is why we are asking for support for our motion. Manfred Weber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of Mr Mauro’s persuasive speech, suddenly even Mr Schulz has conceded that it would be a good thing for us to talk about Europe as a whole now. Alas, the title of today’s debate is Italy. I can absolutely see why many of you have no interest in talking about Europe as a whole. If, for example, I were to look at the media interests of Germany’s Social Democrats, I would observe that they own 90% of the newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau
 and that the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) owns 57% of the Neue Westfälische
 newspaper and holds an interest in the WAZ media group. The largest source of income for the SPD today is its media interests. I can therefore absolutely see why many of you have no interest in talking about ownership in other cases, but instead only want to discuss Italy. This debate is fizzling out because of the situation in Italy and the positive statements that we are hearing. I am not Italian, as you can tell when I speak, but the most convincing argument that comes to my mind is the question of what was the matter between 2006 and 2008 when Italy had a leftist government and, of course, at that time – as Mr Mauro has pointed out – everything was fine and dandy. There were no legislative proposals tabled by the then government to finally end the concentration of the media, though the power was there. Today, when there is once again a clear majority for the conservative parties in Italy, there are suddenly problems again. This debate must not give way to dishonesty. As long as the socialists, the leftists in this House, no longer have arguments to back us into a corner, I can very happily carry on with this debate! Manfred Weber,

Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Western Balkans need Europe and we Europeans need stability in the Western Balkans. The Western Balkans are a central part of Europe and we must do our utmost to bring this important part back home to Europe. For that reason, these are the right proposals. The reality of life in this area has been described; the depressingly long queues at visa offices, the young people with no prospect of making an application to leave the country and get a taste of life in Europe. A lot of people experience this area as a prison, where they have no contact with the outside world. We all want to put an end to this and, in my group, Mrs Pack, Mrs Bildt and Mr Posselt are working on this with a great deal of dedication. We all stand for this. What worries us is that, as a result of the different treatment of the states in this area, there will be separatist movements and different classes of citizens in the area of the Western Balkans will be created, which could certainly lead to problems. However, the citizens in the European Union equally expect security. That means that the standards that Commissioner Barrot described here today, namely security standards for police cooperation, in the fight against illegal immigration and economic migration and for biometric data, are the agreed minimum standards which represent the rules of play. Our citizens expect those rules of play to be adhered to. That brings me to my second point: there must be no foreign policy concessions on the question of visa waiver. We should not give these states a free rein. The rules of play are clear and anyone who abides by them has every chance of having visas waived. The pressure on the states which have been unable to improve their standards hitherto, despite EU aid, should not let up. These are the two flanks that we in the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) consider to be right. We trust in the evaluation that the European Commission has carried out and can therefore approve the present step. Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, during this debate many people have expressed their gratitude to the Czech Presidency for the fact that it has still managed to complete a few projects, in administrative terms, by the end of its term of office. I ask myself in all seriousness: have we really become so modest in our expectations? We are in the business of politics. What we actually expect, in the greatest economic crisis for decades which is combined with environmental challenges, is a Presidency which shows leadership and vision. That is what we really expect. We have seen that the administrative work has been completed for what is still on the table at end of the term of office. I really would have expected more. Prime Minister, if you meet with President Klaus this evening, please tell him that had an opportunity during these six months to make the Czech national identity and sovereignty clear to Europe by showing strong leadership. He did of course promote the importance of national sovereignty here in Parliament. Unfortunately, he missed the opportunity. Markus Ferber,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that, through today’s debate on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments, we have advanced into the core area for financial market regulation within this legislative period; now we need to regulate the financial markets and not just look at individual products, as we did in the past. I just want to pick out a few key terms. In the last year we have not made life easy for ourselves. We have conducted a hearing in committee, we have surveyed all the stakeholders and every interested group, and on this basis, through various processes, working documents and the like, produced a result which we are setting before this plenary session here today and tomorrow. I will take a few points from it. Firstly, market structure. On the one hand, we must concede that in recent years something has happened in the financial markets which has made it in Parliament’s interest that each trade in securities takes place under the MiFID rules, which is why we have approved a new category – bounded by many conditions – called Organised Trading Facilities, where only non-equities can be traded, where proprietary trading is forbidden and where, with regard to execution, transaction and customer interaction, execution may take place at the operator’s discretion. Through this process I think that we are making an important contribution to ensuring that the entire area of traded OTC papers is handled within the MiFID environment. Another major subject not considered in the last MiFID is algorithmic or high-frequency trading. Once again, we needed to issue clear rules here, so that these areas, which can be very dangerous and can be manipulatively employed, is subject to a strict system with minimum holding periods, trade interruption opportunities, the option to test algorithms, the option of examining algorithms within the supervisory structure, the introduction of tick-size regimes, a minimum price, and corresponding fee systems.  Another subject I would like to touch on is the area of commodities futures markets. I do believe that we have a particular responsibility here, when it comes to restricting the speculative part of commodities futures markets, not to contribute through bad regulation to a situation where people in the third and fourth worlds can no longer buy food. Because of this, we have chosen a two-pronged approach with the aim of curbing speculation but not thereby damaging the real economy. We want to achieve this by using position limits with strict ceilings on the number of contracts or positions. We also want to ensure, by means of the position-check system, that those who can prove that they really need a product do not suddenly speculate in this market. Another issue that concerns us is the area of investor protection. I would like to point out here that we have chosen a very broad approach in guaranteeing protection for consumers and investors. This means that the requirements of specific customer groups need to be identified. Not every small saver needs access to highly complex papers. What is needed is to define the relevant products for target groups, carry out product testing, make telephone recordings, give relevant advice, disclosure requirements, but – I want to briefly mention – to proceed, with regard to commissions, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. Member States should be able, according to their structures, to make relevant accommodations. I think we are on the right track here. My time is running out, so I thank everyone who has been involved. I think it is a shame that we only have four minutes’ speaking time for such a complex report. I thank all my colleagues who collaborated on this and the Commission for the very constructive role it has played in recent weeks and months. I hope that a strong vote in the plenary session tomorrow will put us in a situation to negotiate with the Council in order to resolve this important report as soon as possible. Markus Ferber,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief. Firstly, I am pleased that I have such wide support, from the extreme left to the extreme right. I do not know whether this is a good thing – but perhaps it is helpful to have found a compromise in the middle.  Secondly, I want to point out here that we are talking about financial market regulation. Therefore, it depends on which markets trading takes place on. Trading in financial products always involves risk: there is no such thing as a risk-free financial market. If you demonise financial markets per se, you will be unhappy with any regulation. This was not our intention. It was our intention, on the one hand, to ensure that every trade in financial products takes place within a regulated framework and, on the other hand, that these financial markets generate added value for the economy and do not exist purely for their own sake. If we have anything to learn from the time before 2008 it is that financial markets acted independently and did not generate any added value for the real economy – this has been the painful experience of recent years. As a result, we have produced something together. My heartfelt thanks, therefore, go to all the shadow rapporteurs who collaborated on this report. We will have the privilege of holding meetings with the Council over the coming months in order to produce a good result. I hope that we can take the good spirit we have maintained in discussions over almost a year into those negotiations. Markus Ferber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is important that we as the European Parliament grapple very hard with the European Semester – after all, we introduced it when we negotiated the ‘six-pack’. Why? I believe that we in Europe have not been suffering from formulating the rules of the game together but rather we are suffering from the fact that, in the end, the rules are not being applied as they were formulated at the European level. Parliament ought to lead this process very strongly and also to continue to touch on the sore points where things are not working as agreed.  I think that the report before us – for which I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, in particular – provides an important indicator of what can be improved in the interaction between Member States, national parliaments, the European Parliament, the Commission, which must oversee the whole procedure, and the processes that then take place in the Member States. We must now cooperate to use all the euphoria, the spirit of optimism – that is right, we want to make things better for the future – and this momentum, if we want Europe to learn lasting lessons from the financial, economic and national debt crisis. There are many, many important contributions here, both in the individual reports from the Commission to the Member States and in the work we at Parliament have produced.  Many thanks to the rapporteur for this. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) emphatically supports this report. However, over the coming weeks, months and years we will ensure not only that many documents are written but that policy is implemented in the interests of European citizens and taxpayers. Markus Ferber  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should concentrate on today’s subject, and forget about things that are off topic. What are we discussing today? We are discussing how we want to bring Parliament and the Member States together in order to establish strict ground rules that will not go the way of all things European, which is to say that, while they may be adopted here, when it comes to application, they no longer play a major role, as we have already experienced in many, many cases – not only with the euro, but elsewhere, too. We want to establish ground rules that really oblige the Member States to do things that are urgently necessary, in order to guarantee that which states were originally created to provide, namely, guaranteeing infrastructure, education, employment, social security and many other things for the people, although not at the expense of future generations or other Member States. We should therefore not do the other thing proposed in numerous amendments, which is to say, we should not accompany this obligation with the development of any new sources of funding that have only one purpose, namely, to reward those who have not kept to the rules hitherto and punish those who have. A Europe on that basis will not work in the long term. Europe will only work if everyone adheres to the ground rules agreed. The idea of a debt redemption fund must therefore be rejected. Such a fund punishes those who kept their houses in order, to the benefit of those who did not. The idea of eurobonds must therefore be rejected. Such bonds punish those who acted properly and adhered to the rules and reward those who did not. These sections should therefore be rejected. Markus Ferber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with all the problems relating to the details that we could talk about, and which we will be talking about, in the further legislative procedure, we should not lose sight of one thing: financial markets cannot function according to a model in which, when everything is going well, the banks take the profits, and then, when something goes wrong, taxpayers have to pick up the tab. That is why it makes sense for there also to be a tax on financial transactions. It also makes sense for this to be done in a cross-border arrangement. In Europe – or at least in the euro area – this would not result in distortions; rather, it would make a lasting contribution to bringing about a stable financial market which generates what financial markets are actually there for, namely, to provide enterprises with access to capital, to allow savers to save or put something aside for their old age, and so that the financial markets can once again do the job for which they were once created, which is to provide added value for the real economy. Everything that drove us into the financial crisis consisted of products that added no value for the real economy. That is why it makes sense to have a tax that can be used to help ensure that this is severely penalised, that sanctions are taken, that steers us towards a situation in which capital goes back to doing its job. That is why I am advocating that we adopt this proposal today with a broad majority. Markus Ferber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must put an end to a few of the fairytales that are often told here. Fairytale number 1: austerity policies are cold and heartless and push people into social exclusion. That is not true. Austerity policies involve creating opportunities, so that future generations have the chance to do the jobs that they need to do. While the policy in some areas is sustainable, what has repeatedly been said here about financial policy is not sustainable at all. Fairytale number 2: eurobonds are the solution to all our problems. In fact, eurobonds are a sweet-tasting poison. They provide those people with money under favourable terms who can no longer obtain it elsewhere under favourable terms, so that they can run up even more debts. This is why we must categorically reject eurobonds. Fairytale number 3: all our problems will be solved by a debt redemption fund. Just to make it clear what we are talking about, a debt redemption fund means that the Member States generate surpluses per se
, so that they can make use of the fund. During the repayment period, they cannot accumulate any new debts, otherwise the whole system will cease to function. We need to look more closely at the truth and the reality before we start calling for model solutions. For this reason, the only possibility for offering people lasting future prospects and for defending the European social model on an ongoing basis in competition with other economic areas is to increase our competitiveness. We will not do this by relying more heavily on the state. Instead, we need to give companies the opportunity to invest money, for example, by selling building plots where people know that what they build on the plot will belong to them, as an illustration of the problem in Greece, and where they know that the state will not constantly be intervening with non-tariff trade barriers to limit their growth, as an illustration of the problem in France. We can only increase our competitiveness by overcoming the challenges on global markets and Germany is a good example of this. Markus Ferber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should stop acting as if we can save the world every time we get together in Strasbourg. Once again, we have a proposal on the table, and once again we are saving the world, the climate, our resources and who knows what else – even though we have already done it before elsewhere. It makes no sense to do the same thing over and over again. That is why I want to state very clearly that it makes no sense – as the Commissioner has said – to burden aviation, where we have a functioning emissions certificate trading system that we hope will also soon be effective internationally, with an additional tax. It makes no sense to include shipping, which has ideal alternative options, in this tax. It makes no sense to engineer a compromise between energy density and CO2
 emissions. Excuse me for saying so, but as an engineer, I must point out that high energy density means lower CO2 
emissions per kilometre travelled. Penalising this correlation twice is equally non-sensical. I therefore have to say that the Commission proposal has not been fully thought out. What the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs approved by a majority – against the wishes of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – only makes a half-baked proposal worse still. There is not the slightest chance that unanimity will be achieved in the Council of Ministers. That is why we need to be honest here in the European Parliament and say that we reject the report. We need to throw out this proposal. It is half-baked, unusable, and there are better ways of saving the world than through tax legislation. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Mr Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, once again, the Heads of State or Government are meeting to discuss growth, employment and competitiveness and to exchange papers on these subjects without actually taking any action. I can remember papers on the topic of youth unemployment at the end of the 1990s which identified that some Member States had lower levels of youth unemployment and others had higher levels, and which explained that it would be a good idea to look at what those countries with low rates were doing. Fourteen years have now passed and nothing has happened. When people say that we need to show solidarity, I would like to remind them that in the last 31 years, Greece has received more than EUR 100 billion from the Structural Funds. That is an expression of European solidarity. It has repeatedly been said that the money can be used, for example, to fund education and training, in particular for young people. I can remember initiatives in the region which I come from that involved attempts to introduce the dual educational system in different areas of Greece. However, this did not work. The energy revolution is still in progress in Greece and this and many other things could be financed using money from the Structural Funds. This demonstrates Europe’s solidarity. However, we also need to increase the pressure to ensure that the funds made available by the European Union are used for the purposes which will be discussed during the spring summit. Otherwise, this will once again be a summit with lots of interesting papers but no concrete results. Markus Ferber  (PPE
),  
Blue-card answer.

 Mr President, Mr Ferreira, I specifically referred to the European Union Structural Funds. However, I would like to ask for understanding on this point. If this funding had been spent in the same way as the Federal Republic of Germany used the money from the Marshall Plan, you would not need a rescue package today. Markus Ferber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to be a little bit more honest again in this debate. What was the situation like before the euro was introduced? What were the interest rates like in Greece when it still had the drachma? What were the rates in Italy when it had the lira, or in Spain with the peseta and Portugal with the escudo? They were considerably higher than what has to be paid on the financial markets at the moment. Those Member States within the euro enjoyed the sweet poison of low interest rates for a decade, and pursued a spending policy that they are no longer on top of. For them to now say that they want to continue to enjoy that sweet poison via the introduction of Eurobonds is precisely the wrong reaction to have. Many mistakes were made here in the past that now need to be corrected. Anyone who believes that this problem would be solved by making the drug that is low interest rates available on a sustained basis would be taking away the pressure that, thank goodness, is currently being applied to a number of Member States by the financial markets. As a second issue, I would point out that Europe would not be made healthy where the result of Eurobonds would be not to make the sick healthy, but to make the healthy sick. That is why we need to be honest on this issue, too. Eurobonds would not strengthen the European Union, they would weaken it. Then we have the craziest proposal of all in this resolution, namely to engineer a kind of self-funding reduction of debts through new debts via a redemption fund. What world are we living in? In real terms, what that means is that the debts that countries have run up would be refinanced thanks to the creditworthiness of others, with the costs being borne by those who kept their finances in order in that they have to pay higher interest rates for those who failed to do likewise. That is the communitarisation of debts. Anyone introducing this as a policy instrument endangers Europe much, much more than what we have currently put in place in connection with the rescue packages. I can therefore but warn against acting as if Eurobonds would enable us to solve all our problems. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Markus Ferber  (PPE

 Ms Goulard, I will just say, briefly, that that is not a judgment that I have put forward here. I would just point out that the last government bonds issued by Italy before it joined the euro bore an interest rate of 10%. There was no outcry in Italy at the time. Nobody said that other countries should take on the debt. It was natural for Italy to pay high interest rates. Yet now, all of a sudden, because we have had low interest rates for 10 years and got up to our ears in debt, because money was cheap – for investments just as for the public purse – we want to prolong that through Eurobonds. That represents a trap from which we will not escape, and I stand by what I said. Markus Ferber,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to join in thanking our rapporteur and all those who worked on the report because this is certainly not a routine task, even if this is the fortieth time we have dealt with competition policy on the basis of a report from the Commission. I would like to thank the Commissioner for his very comprehensive presentation – 2010 was, of course, the first year in which you had full responsibility for competition policy. Turning to something you mentioned yourself, I would like to ask that some practices in the area of public aid in the banking sector should be eradicated because the new stress tests required by the European banking supervision system indicate a need for further recapitalisation for the banks. I do not believe that it will contribute anything to the stability of the banking system if we still have a large number of unresolved or outstanding old cases on the one hand, while new cases are being created on the other because pressure is increasing to raise the equity capital quota accordingly, particularly in the area of private banks. Hence my urgent plea to you, Commissioner, to find a swift solution that will help stabilise the banking sector so that it can withstand the challenges of the international environment. The second major issue, the control of mergers, will continue to concern us increasingly in the years ahead. Here, too, I can only urge you to continue on the clear and transparent path taken by the Commission to date within the framework of merger control. It is in the interests of all involved, particularly the consumer, that we should ensure that competition is possible in the area of merger control, whether in larger or other structures, which is not for me to judge. With this in mind, I would like to thank all those who have been involved. I hope, Commissioner, that we will find a solution soon, particularly in the banking sector. Markus Ferber  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I can only agree with all of those who have congratulated the Council Presidency. Not only were you an honest broker during a difficult time; you were also a European broker. That was very nice to see during these difficult times in which we are seeing political trends in a number of Member States that suggest to the people that it would be possible to achieve more alone than together. You focused on what unites us. It was also very refreshing to see that, with this clear European agenda, you also received the support of the people in Poland on domestic policy matters. That was not particularly easy in this context. Therefore, I have the highest respect for what you have achieved. In this six-month period, we were also able to get a few things under way in the area of financial market regulation. Allow me to highlight just one area in which I was able to join in the negotiations myself, namely, the question of the regulation of short selling and naked credit default swaps in connection with government bonds, where the Commission did not have the confidence to propose a stringent regulation and with regard to which all the Member States said that we would not succeed, and where, thanks to the Polish Presidency, we did succeed in imposing sanctions against a highly speculative instrument and, where necessary, prohibiting it, so that we could help to bring greater stability to the financial markets. I would particularly like to thank your Finance Minister and the Secretary of State, who got this off the ground during a difficult discussion process between Parliament and the Council. That is an example that shows that we can do something together in the interests of security and stability in Europe. I would like to express my sincere thanks for that. Markus Ferber  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Dowgielewicz, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, we ought to focus once again on our task here today. I have now listened to eight speakers and eight different solutions. That demonstrates the problem that we have here in this House. I am, of course, pleased that there is a more united approach in the Council and that things can be brought together more quickly than the many proposals that we have now heard from the various political groups. If we need to be clear about one thing, however, then it is that we need to make immediate and united efforts to put in order what the Member States have so far prevented us from sorting out. It was easy for the US to establish a European regulation because the country already had institutions at a Federal level. We needed jointly to establish these first, and we have done that together as Parliament, even in the face of opposition, for example, from the United Kingdom. By tightening up the Stability and Growth Pact with the Governance Package, we have shown that we are capable of action here and are able to strengthen Europe to enable it to function. However, Mr Barroso, I also have a very strong point of criticism: we cannot now talk about accelerated procedures if we still have no proposals from the Commission for the majority of the necessary regulations. We are waiting for the regulation of financial markets and the Market Abuse Directive to name but two, which will probably not be tabled until next week. We cannot adopt something that is not even on the table! Therefore, my sincere request is for the Commission to press forward with these matters. All of this was intended to be done in the first half of this year. It is now October! You cannot accuse Parliament of not doing its job. We are genuinely doing everything possible to find appropriate solutions. Therefore, please table the proposals and then we will adopt them. Markus Ferber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add my thanks for the clear affirmation you have given to the European project, Mr Tusk. I believe that now, in the 21st century, it makes sense to make a concerted effort to address problems that one country cannot resolve on its own and to find a good solution in the interest of our citizens. Thank you very much for your clear expression of commitment in this area. The tasks facing you in the second half of 2011 are enormous. The key one has already been mentioned, namely, the Greek rescue. I believe that it is right and proper that the European Union should take the lead here, rather than allowing the credit rating agencies to set the pace and direction for our actions. We shall also have to adjust our internal mechanisms if we are to remain capable of action and ensure stability. Unfortunately, Mr Farage has left us, but I would appreciate it if continuous attacks on our common currency from within the European Union would stop, even from those who are not part of the currency union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to answer this question. If we continue with this debate for the next few years, then the Americans will decide on the world’s environmental protection, the Chinese will dictate consumer protection and Europeans will have no protections whatsoever. Our job is to work for the people. (Applause)
 I wanted to briefly point out that we also have a number of problems to resolve in the area of the regulation of the financial markets, both in terms of the governance package and in relation to financial services. I look forward to working with you and hope that we Europeans can play a significant role in stabilising the financial markets. We have a particular duty in this regard and I am optimistic that we will succeed admirably under the Polish Presidency. Markus Ferber,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is right for us to debate this important proposal from the Commission here in plenary today and for us to lay down our position as the European Parliament tomorrow, because discussions in recent weeks – with all respect to the Hungarian Presidency, which has tried very hard to bring the Council and Parliament closer together on this – have shown that the Council of Ministers still needs to be motivated into adopting rules that allow what is necessary, but which prohibit what is not necessary. Let me say quite plainly that I can hardly stand to hear the word liquidity any more. If there was one problem that was to blame for leading us into the financial crisis, it was that there was too much liquidity that was invested in products that nobody needs and which then collapsed and took us into the crisis. I ask you therefore: who is it that needs insurance against a government defaulting on its commitments? Only those that hold such government securities, and they should indeed have it. Anyone speculating on a country being unable to meet its commitments, however, should not be able to use such instruments to do so. That is why these products must be prohibited. When it comes to the short selling of shares – in other words, selling shares that one does not have – it is a matter of drawing up rules that prevent highly speculative behaviour. I believe we have achieved a reasonable compromise here, and in this respect discussions with the Council have been very constructive. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding work. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive discussions, and also the Commission, which has played a very positive part in achieving this. Moreover, I hope that, for its part, the Council – which is unfortunately not represented here today – will be able to agree a sensible resolution of this matter with us as soon as possible. With that in mind, I am pleased that we – as Parliament – are now sending out a clear signal as regards this important dossier. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is actually about innovative financing, but we have already heard something about that. Innovation does not simply mean inventing new taxes or re-labelling what has always been there, such as national debt. I would like to concentrate very briefly on what this debate is really about. It is not about the introduction of Eurobonds – and the CDU/CSU parties will certainly speak out against that – but rather it is about learning the lessons of the crisis in the financial markets, and that means quite simply that speculation must be taxed too. It also means – and I will state this quite clearly – that if this cannot be done worldwide at the G20, then we must do it at European Union level. There is no alternative; that is why I am not simply looking for applause now, Mr Bullmann, but for a clear, strong vote by the European Parliament tomorrow. In this, Commissioner, the Commission must act as our ally against the Member States – particularly against the Member State that we have just heard speaking so loudly about what the City of London thinks. I will simply say to you, Mr Farage: look at the unemployment figures and look at the economic decline of your country, which has concentrated on financial market products. If you still built cars – as we do in Bavaria and in Germany – then you would be doing somewhat better now. That is why the financial transaction tax must be called for and introduced now as a matter of urgency. It is our duty as Europeans. Markus Ferber  (PPE

 Madam President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that today is a good day, not only for the European institutions, but also for the people of Europe, because we have succeeded, two years after the collapse of the Lehman bank, in creating a structure that, although not eliminating all of the problems that could arise in the financial market, will help to make the excesses that have occurred in the financial market no longer possible in the European Union. We can be proud of ourselves for this. I would like to express my thanks to the Belgian Presidency, because we had the feeling – and I can endorse what Mrs Goulard said – that the Council was not making much of an effort in this regard at the beginning. Although the Council adopted a unanimous resolution at first, it did not solve the problems. It was thanks to the European Parliament that a solution was found across the group divides which is truly viable and which will ensure that we have stable supervisory structures as well as a range of instruments that can be used in crisis situations to stem excesses and thus help to stabilise the financial sector. I would like to thank you most sincerely, Mr Reynders, as you have personally shown a great deal of commitment to this matter. However, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the Commission, which ensured that, in a fair dialogue, the two positions represented by the Council and Parliament, which were very far apart to start with, could be brought together. Thank you very much. That gives us hope with regard to further legislation. Markus Ferber,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the second and third Postal Services Directive, I am, of course, particularly pleased that this subject is also on the agenda during this parliamentary term, because I believe it is also important to show what we have achieved since we tabled the Green Paper in 1992, as the Commissioner mentioned. We have managed to significantly improve the quality of postal services throughout Europe. I can still remember that, two parliamentary terms ago, I said in this Chamber that it was usual for holidaymakers to arrive home before the postcards they had sent home to their loved ones. That situation has now changed. We have achieved a significant improvement in the quality of cross-border postal services. We have achieved a significant improvement in the quality of postal services within the Member States. With the obligation for a universal service that is uniform throughout Europe, we have also managed to significantly improve the availability of postal services, or in areas where it was already good, we were able to maintain this level. That is also important, and it was mentioned by both the Commissioner and our committee chair. Of course, in implementing the third directive, which for the majority of Member States specifies 1 January 2011 as the date for complete liberalisation, it is now important to safeguard this universal service on a permanent basis. I would like to emphasise what is stated in the question regarding the simultaneous requirement – and that was the Conditio sine qua non
 for the third directive – that it should not result in a deterioration in working conditions, but that existing social standards and protection mechanisms should continue to apply in the Member States beyond 1 January 2011. We will, of course, ensure that this is the case. We will not only have the oral question today, but the Commission also has obligations to provide us with reports. We will read these reports very carefully, Commissioner, and if necessary we will also formulate the appropriate conclusions. Markus Ferber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, one could wonder what we have actually now achieved after a year spent in discussions, debates and many sessions in the trialogue, and I could have certainly imagined doing something nicer than spending my time there. One year on from the European elections, when we announced in public how we wanted to bring the finance markets into line, we are now at a point where our success rate ranges from very little to none at all. The problem has already been explained. We are dealing with markets which operate globally nowadays. Member States still believe that they can use their national supervisory structures to apply rules in this environment. The fact that this did not work was not what actually triggered the financial crisis, but it contributed to Europe being affected by it as well. This is why I would ask when this realisation, which is often mentioned in grandiose speeches, will be converted into political action, where it is suddenly about protecting stock exchange centres and banking structures and no longer about protecting citizens. This is the task to which we have committed ourselves as the European Parliament. I hope that Member States will commit themselves to this task, too, because we share the responsibility for implementing proper supervision regulations for citizens, which will ensure that individuals’ savings are also permanently secure. I would of course hope – and I am now addressing the Commissioners – that every effort will now be made by the Commission so that we can achieve a good outcome as quickly as possible, for the benefit of people living in Europe. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is this all about then? The question is quite simply how can the financial markets help to reduce the costs that they have incurred for states, societies and the economy? That is the crucial question that we must answer. I think that together, we have developed a very balanced text. I am also very grateful to the Commissioner for the way he has worded it. On the one hand, we cannot pretend that Europe is the Island of the Blessed where we can do what we like without the global financial markets reacting to it. Things must be coordinated internationally. On the other hand, we must also ensure that the sector makes an appropriate contribution to overcoming the crisis. That is why I would caution that we must stop coming up with a new item every week that we can use to solve all the problems of the world. A couple of months ago, it was an additional levy on airline tickets that was going to solve all our problems, now it is the tax on financial transactions and next month, somebody will think of something else. That is going too far. It is a question of involving the financial markets in an internationally coordinated manner. If a sensible solution to this can be put forward by the Commission and introduced into international negotiations, then we will be on the right track. We should also be honest with ourselves. Those who maintain that we can stop speculation with such instruments are clearly deluding themselves. What we want is for speculators to make their contribution to the risk and to overcoming the risk. That is the right approach. In doing so, you have our full support Commissioner. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to begin with, it is right that common procedures should go with a common currency. It is right to consider how these common procedures, which have not yet been implemented everywhere in the Single Euro Payments Area, might be enforced a little better. On the other hand, I will say quite clearly that we still have to adapt the rulebook in a few places. I myself come from a country where the direct debit procedure is a very widespread procedure, in order to facilitate the processing of certain regular payments. The procedure that is currently planned in the rulebook is a very bureaucratic, very complicated procedure and therefore, I would be very pleased, Commissioner, if, with regard to a final date – something we all want – this area in particular is tackled once again. On the one hand, there should be no vulnerability to fraud – that is a problem in the cross-border area – but on the other hand, it should also be possible for local charges to be debited, and for any magazine subscription, any insurance premium, any mobile phone bill, and so on to continue to be collected in a simple procedure by the companies concerned. That is my request and there is also a corresponding passage in our motion for a resolution on this subject, so that we can contribute to ensuring that procedures that have proved successful in the Member States can also be guaranteed after the final introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area. Markus Ferber  (PPE

 Madam President, Commission President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, what is tomorrow’s vote all about? It is about doing what many people in this House cannot do and others do not want to do. It is, in fact, about taking responsibility for Europe. I would like to highlight one point. Mr Barroso, I am very grateful to you for mentioning this again in your interruption. It is about taking responsibility for Europe’s ability to act during a difficult time, in order to overcome all the problems which have been the subject of justified criticism from citizens and also from this Parliament. I believe that today’s debate has helped to clarify the issue of whom Europe can and cannot rely on in future when it comes to taking political responsibility in the years to come. However, I would like to point out, Mr Barroso, that there is, of course, a whole series of subjects on the agenda which need to be dealt with and you have a great deal of responsibility in this area because you have a monopoly on launching initiatives at a European level. I would like to look at one more subject which seems to me not to have been covered in sufficient detail in the debate so far and that is agricultural policy. In this area, we are faced with several new challenges. It is not enough simply to mention the fact that the agriculture ministers came to a resolution in the autumn of last year. It is not enough that we have begun a programme of comprehensive agricultural reform, because when the basic conditions change, you must, of course, take a corresponding initiative to help farmers in the European Union. My request is that you take the Commissioner for Agriculture on one side and point out to her that her model will not succeed in guiding this important sector out of the crisis. We are prepared, and I am speaking on behalf of my colleagues here, to take over responsibility for Europe in the interests of the European Union and the people of Europe. Martin Kastler  (PPE
),

 Along with a large majority in Parliament, I have voted against the ACTA. Today it is a case of ACTA ad acta
. Tomorrow it will be a new start for increased market protection. In its current form, the ACTA was beset with too many errors and a lack of clarity. It confused people and resulted in a large amount of public pressure in the social networks and new media, the latter being something positive. I also still find it annoying that for years the ACTA was kept secret and was only made public at a late stage following intensive pressure from the European Parliament. We MEPs were expected to rubber stamp everything in a fast-track procedure. That is not acceptable. Many mistakes were made that we can only correct by making a completely new start. The clear ‘no’ to ACTA is, for me, an unqualified ‘yes’ to global protection against ‘commercial-scale counterfeiting and piracy’, which is actually the key concern of the agreement. Without effective, global coordination of copyright protection, Europe has a great deal to lose. Intellectual property is Europe’s most valuable raw material. Our decision today clears the way for the development of a new, better and transparent agreement under European leadership. This process can and must take place in dialogue with all ‘stakeholders’ – with the focus on people and ethics. Martin Kastler  (PPE
).

 Mr President, there is a German rhyme: Ein kleines Dorf im Frankenland ist durch sein gutes Bier bekannt
, which tells of regional pride in a brewery, and this demonstrates a problem that we have created today. If this brewery or its distributor is 107 kilometres away from where I live, then in future, it will no longer be able to supply me with its products unless it buys a new tachograph and complies with new red tape. That is why I voted against this resolution today, because in my view, we should not be overburdening our small and medium-sized enterprises. There are many points that we have managed to incorporate which were positive. After all, it was planned that a radius of just 50 kilometres should be accepted for regional suppliers. The Commission was being quite absurd there. A distance of 100 kilometres may be just about feasible. However, what if the distance is more than this? I therefore consider it to be excessive. One final aspect: as a representative of an employees’ organisation in the German CSU party, I would also say that this regulation represents complete control of workers. Why? It is because the entire working day of those distributing construction materials or drinks from the breweries is completely controlled via GPS. For data protection reasons, too, therefore, I feel that what we have decided today is highly questionable, and I emphasise once again why I voted against it. Martin Kastler  (PPE

Madam President, I voted against the Ferreira report for a number of reasons. Reading our newspapers in Germany – only today, one of the big dailies says that the German chancellor is asking whether anybody still sticks to the rules in Europe, or they say that Cyprus is the next candidate for a bailout – I ask myself: ‘What next?’. Just as the previous speaker said that after the ‘six-pack’ comes the ‘two-pack’, I believe that after the ‘two-pack’ will come the ‘zero-pack’, because we no longer know how it is actually supposed to work. I am very concerned that we, the elected representatives, will be the last to find out the secret plan that the European Commission and the institutions have for how we carry on with Europe. I am firmly convinced that in the future, we will have to consider how we carry on at all. The mood among the population of my constituency is so bad that it is clear: we want to help, but we also want to have rules, and those rules should be adhered to and checked. I cannot therefore vote for further debt, for a Europe of debt, a transfer union, which is what we already have in many areas. I am against eurobonds. I am also against project bonds, because I do not think that they will help us to act usefully in this area in the future and make progress together. I hope, however, that at some point, the European institutions will tell us transparently and openly about this so-called secret plan, so that we find out what it involves. Martin Kastler,

 Mr President, Mr De Gucht, your statement was very informative. Thank you very much. Sometimes, figures say more than words. Up to this point, as you have mentioned, the European Patent Office has granted almost 2 000 patents for plants and almost 1 200 patents for animals created with and without the use of genetic engineering. I would like to mention two prominent examples. The first is the approval of patents on barley which has been genetically modified and modified by breeding. This applies to the entire chain from the seed through to the plant and, therefore, affects both our farmers and our brewers, both producers and consumers. This example shows the devastating scope of the patenting processes. The second example concerns the so-called long-life tomato, which is not to be confused with the long-life oil in the engines of your diesel cars. The ploy used by the applicant, the US company Arcadia, enabled it to obtain a patent by circumventing current EU regulations. It was not the tomato that was patented, but its genetic material, in this case, selected enzymes. This shows the lengths that companies will go to, despite the fact that, as you have said, Mr De Gucht, Article 4 of the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions of 1998 clearly states: The following shall not be patentable: (a) plant and animal varieties; (b) essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals. We are of the opinion that this definition should be made more precise. Technical processes used to support conventional breeding activities must not lead to patentability. We would like to make it quite clear that there must be no patents on life. We need to send out a clear signal that there needs to be a more ethical approach and greater honesty with regard to creation. I repeat: we are opposed to the patentability of life throughout Europe. Therefore, Mr De Gucht, we are calling for a clear statement from the Commission that patents on genetic material and genetic resources are, and will remain, banned. Secondly, we are calling for a clear position on Article 4 of the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions: no patents on life. Thirdly, Mr De Gucht, on behalf of many farmers and breeders in Europe, we are calling for the breeders’ and farmers’ privilege to be clearly enshrined in all legislation. Martin Kastler  (PPE
),

 Today, I have voted in favour of the resolution on the Statute for a European cooperative society with regard to the involvement of employees. It is good that we are focusing specifically on the subject of cooperatives in the European Parliament, as this is the International Year of Cooperatives. In the European Union, there are around 160 000 cooperatives, which are owned by more than a quarter of all Europeans and employ about 5.4 million people. In my home region of Bavaria alone, there are over 1 200 cooperatives and cooperative enterprises with more than 2.7 million members. Cooperatives are one of the cornerstones of our economy. Their achievements are even more obvious in times of crisis, because cooperatives involve taking joint responsibility. For example, during the financial crisis, cooperative banks demonstrated how sustainable and resilient they are as a result of their cooperative business model. They have not lost billions in the crisis like other banks. On the contrary, their balance sheets show an increase in revenue and growth. They provide 5.4 million high-quality, crisis-proof jobs throughout Europe. Cooperatives have their roots in the regions where they are located. They represent a model for the future, for our regions and for Europe. If we promote the cooperative model as part of EU development policy, we can make a contribution which will really help people, actively involve them and encourage them to be independent. We need more incentives for cooperatives. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I can only support what my colleague, Mr Posselt, has already said: Strasbourg is the capital of Europe, the seat of the European Parliament. I propose that we should close Brussels, that we stop shuttling back and forth between Brussels and Strasbourg, and that we finally invest here. We own the buildings here, but not the ones in Brussels. This is the seat of Parliament. I have to ask myself: we entertain so many visitors here in Strasbourg every month. We explain how Europe works to them. Why are we building a Parliamentarium, a museum of European history, in Brussels? That belongs here in Strasbourg. It is for this reason that I voted against this report. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I have voted against the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the feasibility of introducing stability bonds. The name has been changed, but the content remains the same. These are Eurobonds. We have now reached a stage in Europe where we need to ask ourselves the fundamental question of how Europe is to go forward. The Italian Prime Minister, Mr Monti, said today in a guest article in Germany that we need to ‘rethink democracy’. To this, I would add that we must ‘rethink Europe’. We must do this if we want to carry the citizens of Europe along with us. I believe that referendums are an important instrument. We need citizens to become increasingly involved in Europe, not only in the Member States, but also at a European level. This will enable us to discuss the major issues currently facing us which have led us into this crisis. It will take us further forward than simply tabling new motions for resolutions to distribute ever larger debts among ourselves. Every country is responsible for its own debts. We should not be transferring debts from one state to another. Martin Kastler  (PPE
).

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me preface my remarks by saying that I am also greatly in favour of freedom of movement and I believe that it is a really important achievement for the European Union that we can move around this single market freely in the service sectors, indeed in all sectors. However, there is also a principle that applies not just within the European Union, but also under the rule of law, namely: pacta sunt servanda
 – treaties are to be honoured. According to the Treaty, a clause applies to the free movement of workers, setting down a period of three years, plus two years, plus two years. Accordingly, I was unable to support this resolution today, as it is just a symbol of a willingness to alter treaties while they are still in force. In my opinion, it should be up to the Member States themselves to decide. This is what it says in the Treaties. That was correct. Nonetheless, when the Treaties lapse and all restrictions run out, there will be no wave of mass migration to the old Member States from the other Member States. I am absolutely convinced that it is by working together that we will achieve progress in the European Union and that no more barriers should be imposed. Martin Kastler  (PPE
).

Madam President, I was happy to vote in favour of the report on the mid-term review of the strategy of the European Union for occupational health and safety today. I would like to emphasise three points that I consider particularly important. The first is paragraph 82, which we approved today. I would have preferred it if we had given an even clearer signal in regard to work-life balance, everything relating to occupational health and how we regulate work, the rhythm we provide workers with, including, above all, the protection of Sundays as a day of rest. I myself have launched an initiative in this regard and I believe we can all play our part in supporting March 3 next year as a Europe-wide day for Sunday as a day of rest. I also believe paragraph 16 is particularly important. After all, burnout is one of the illnesses that generates the highest costs in Europe. We urgently need a burnout strategy, and next year the European Commission is to publish a relevant study, as well as holding out the prospect of a Green Paper. This is something we urgently need to discuss in Europe. Finally, as the rapporteur for the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations 2012, I would like to make the following call: let us work together in Europe to ensure we respect everyone, both workers and employers alike, in health, vitality and dignity. Martin Kastler  (PPE

I voted against this report today. No one could disagree with the common objective of the EU Member States of halving the number of road traffic fatalities. Almost 100 people are still dying on Europe’s roads every day. The goal is clear – the question is how to get there. Transport policy is, and remains, a national, regional and partly local issue. Successes are only achieved if they are closely based on the reality of people’s lives. Europe is not the right arena for this. Even if all the proposals were scientifically based, this is still not a matter for the EU. The best example of this is the scientifically-based proposal that, in future, children under three years of age should only travel in secure, rear-facing car seats. As a young father, I am well aware that no child aged two or three will want to sit facing backwards on the rear seat. What is more, drivers can no longer see their children, so who knows what might happen. This own-initiative report is superfluous. Signals like this are counter-productive, particularly in the current climate of crisis. We must concentrate on essentials. Martin Kastler,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, next year will be the first year in which there will be more retired people than workers in Europe. This is a major turning point in Europe. It is a good sign that we are today voting to make the year 2012 the European Year for Active Ageing and for solidarity between generations, and we will also duly celebrate it and present it to the public. At this point, I would like to thank the Commission, the Council and the shadow rapporteurs most sincerely for the fact that we were able to reach a compromise together at first reading, and this is the compromise that we are presenting here today and will jointly adopt. I would like to refer you to an amendment that I would ask you to support. A European Year also requires a certain amount of publicity and for that we also need money. We have fought for a budget line for this so that a certain amount is available in order to present to the public the subject of solidarity between generations as well as the subject of active ageing. Thank you very much and I would ask for your support. (Applause) Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have voted today on the report by Mr Goerens and I believe that this report is moving in the right direction. For the first time in the history of the European Union, we have done away with the unquestioning belief in budget support in the field of development aid. This means that for the first time we have stated in a report that we should not simply give money to administrative bodies, to states or to governments without sanctions and without criteria that can be monitored. This is the right way forward. However, in my opinion one thing is missing. This concerns an amendment which I have tabled and which was unfortunately voted down. The amendment stated that we in the European Union must impose sanctions when a state can be proved to have disregarded the criteria which form the basis for the provision of development aid. We must change this situation so that we can maintain our credibility and make it clear to our voters and our taxpayers what we are spending development aid on. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the few of you who are still here, visitors to the European Parliament, in conclusion, I would like to make some brief remarks on the subject of misleading directory companies. I have voted in favour of the resolution because it is important for us in the European Union to make our opinion clear on this. This is a part of organised crime in Europe which involves bogus companies taking money from people and from small and medium-sized businesses over the Internet. We must make every effort to prevent this from happening. The Commission has made many soapbox speeches calling for genuine support to be given to small and medium-sized companies and for the amount of red tape to be reduced. One important aspect of this is to bring an end to this type of organised crime. The resolution represents a step in the right direction, but only a small one. We must take action and, therefore, I am calling on everyone to continue with this work, not only those Members who are not here, but all of us who represent the citizens of Europe in Parliament. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this report as I believe that businesses have a social responsibility – towards their employees and customers, the environment and society at large. A new term has been added to the German dictionary: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). This is – and should remain – a voluntary matter. In our globalised markets, CSR entails much more than making a donation to the local football club. Businesses that operate in a globally responsible way help shape foreign policy and development policy. They are Europe’s ambassadors to the world, flying the flag for Europe’s social standards worldwide. We should support CSR, not regulate it. In this case, Europe’s role should be that of a moderator, not a regulator. This principle must be applied if the European Commission is to get serious and take up the topic of CSR once again: we do not need excessive regulation. We have underlined this position with this report. Martin Kastler  (PPE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, I also voted in favour of this report and of this resolution – in favour of Macedonia. However, if we are being honest about this, then there is one detail that must be mentioned. We cannot tell people and ethnic groups in other countries to rename their language because other countries do not like what they call it. That is laid down in international law, and as Europeans we must be sure that we remain honest about this. I was consequently very annoyed that unfortunately, one amendment was passed that I voted against, which stated that Macedonian should not be allowed to be called Macedonian. Macedonia is a country with great prospects in Europe mainly because it also has great economic prospects in the Balkans, a region that has genuine difficulties, is prospering economically, and is conducting the negotiations with élan – which is very positive. In view of this positive attitude, I would like to thank all the Members who voted for this resolution, as well as all those who worked with the parliament there as part of the European Parliament delegation. We should make these prospects clear to the people there who want to be part of Europe. Let us work together to that end. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I have voted in favour of the Oomen-Ruijten report and would like to emphasise two points. Firstly, when we see that in some countries in Europe too many pensions are being paid out too early, but these countries are getting into difficulties and the others are having to bail them out, that is unfair. This unfairness cannot, of course, be refinanced via the EU. We need European coordination in this regard. The second point that I am very pleased with in this report is the fact that it makes it very clear, according to the principle of subsidiarity, that the Member States themselves are responsible for pension provision. That is indeed the case. I therefore consider this report to be a step in the right direction in that, on the one hand, we in Europe are recognising that our citizens want more coordination in the social sphere because they feel unfairly treated and, on the other, we are making it clear where the main responsibility lies, namely with the Member States. This report represents a step in this direction. We will do everything possible to ensure that the White Paper continues to push ahead with this. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 It is shocking that Christians throughout the world continue to be persecuted and murdered. It is an indictment of Europe that the foreign ministers of the Member States in the Council cannot manage to respond to this. They treat the will of Parliament with contempt. The EU must do something. I call on the Council to show responsibility for the basic right of freedom of religion, to swiftly draw up an implementable strategy to protect Christians throughout the world and to establish a separate unit for intercultural and religious matters in the European External Action Service. These things need to be done now, not some time in the future. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Today’s vote on the European citizens’ initiative is a milestone for more democracy in Europe. I welcome the compromise and I will support it, because the report produced by Mr Lamassoure and Mrs Gurmai is the first step in the right direction. Ladies and gentlemen, we must not be afraid of citizens having more opportunities to express their will. We must give the citizens of Europe more codecision rights, not just every five years at the European elections. This needs courage, stamina and strength. Courage to keep returning to the dialogue. Stamina, because decisions cannot necessarily be made more quickly and strength because our representative democracy includes, at last, in my opinion, more participative elements. Our goal must be to increase the dialogue in Europe between the citizens and the politicians. I am pleased that we are moving one step closer to the Europe of the citizens today with the European citizens’ initiative. I am convinced that one day we Europeans will take joint European decisions, in the form of citizens’ decisions. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 I have voted in favour of the amendments and against the Berlinguer report, because I am not sure that it provides adequate support for subsidiarity. I do not believe that we should be able to delete important details just because this is a large package of directives. This is a strategy which will backfire. For me, the crux of the matter is paragraph 40, which, in the form that it was adopted today, together with other components of the Stockholm Programme, will provoke conflicts of jurisdiction. In specific terms, there are doubts as to whether we should use family law for the mutual recognition of civil status documents, in other words, marriage certificates, and, therefore, whether we should take into account the decision-making authority of the Member States with regard to the definition of marriage, following the procedure outlined in Article 81(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. While this remains unclear, there is a risk of a conflict between the simple procedures of civil law and the complex procedures of cross-border family law. A sentence corresponding with Amendment 3 would have been sufficient to defuse this conflict. This is a detail which, unfortunately, was not supported by the majority in Parliament today. I remain of the opinion that marriage and family life are under the specific protection of the state. They are exclusively a matter for the Member States. Therefore, I have voted against this own-initiative report. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I would like to respond briefly to what Mr Hannan has just said. It is, of course, essential for this Parliament to have a seat, but the seat is established by our treaties and it is here in Strasbourg. You are right to say that we need to save taxpayers’ money and that we must work towards being based in one place. However, the refuge of parliamentarianism, Mr Hannan, is here in Strasbourg. This is where we as Members of Parliament and representatives of the people can work together. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, the Estrela report yesterday covered a very important topic. I would like to say at this point that it was rather difficult for me to vote in favour of it. As a young father, I was present at the birth of both my children and I have to say that I do not know why I would have needed a holiday then, because I did not give birth, my wife did. This is all about maternity leave and we have included fathers. It is difficult point. Nevertheless, it is important for young women to have the opportunity to have a child and then to return to their professional life. I believe that this will be possible under the new system. Although I would personally have preferred 18 weeks, I did eventually vote in favour of 20 weeks in the final vote. We must now ask ourselves whether this will bring more justice and more children in Europe. Family policy in Europe is an issue for the future. I hope that we are sending out a signal that we have taken action in this area. Now we just have to hope that the Member States take corresponding measures. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, incarcerating people in labour camps because they do not share the same views as a governing regime is a crime against human dignity. Slave labour camps, re-education camps and internment camps – these are all anachronisms that have lost none of their repugnance in the 21st century, wherever in the world they may be. I am truly disappointed that the European Commission, against our better judgment, has failed to present any concrete measures to the Members of this House to deal with the Chinese case and has not explained how it envisages future cooperation between the EU and China. If the US has lists of businesses and if books exist publishing the names of businesses that are known to be a front for internment camps, then why is it that you do not have them? Why are you taking this blinkered approach? You and the Commission are making yourselves share in the blame for the misery suffered by those who have been imprisoned, mostly without due legal process. No one could want this. The rule of law is one of our fundamental principles in Europe and in the European Union. As an MEP, I am ashamed to have had to listen to what was said here today. Nonetheless, I am pleased, on the other hand, that we have drawn attention here to this principle of the rule of law for liberty and for human dignity on a cross-party basis. I would like to thank the House for this. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are taking a new and important step forward in the field of animal welfare by providing more protection for animals used in scientific research. We have heard a great deal about animal welfare. We have also heard that Europe is an important location for industrial research and innovation. However, there is one issue which we have not talked about enough. This concerns a fundamental value of the European Union, namely human dignity, and the question of how we handle it. I believe that we must not, on the one hand, improve animal welfare and, on the other, expose ourselves to risks in an area which, at least in part, runs counter to our European values. Why am I saying this? The European Commission has referred to alternative methods in its documents. These include five methods relating to research into and use of embryonic stem cells and, in particular, human stem cells. In my opinion, this is immoral. It is something which I cannot ignore when it comes to voting today on the proposed compromise between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Therefore, I would like to call on you and, in particular, on the Council, the Member States and the Commission, in the form of the so-called Regulatory Committee, to take a highly sensitive approach. When we show concern for human dignity, this does not mean that we are opposed to animal welfare. On the contrary, we want both of these things. We want to cooperate to protect the dignity of living creatures, whether they are animals or humans, in a way that corresponds to our European concept of dignity, so that we can work together to defend and support it. One of Europe’s trademarks is that we are prepared to fight for human freedom and dignity. For this reason, I will not be able to take part in today’s vote, because in moral terms, it is not possible for me to do one thing and ignore another. Discussing this subject today was the right thing to do, but the third dimension of human dignity has come off rather badly. Martin Kastler  (PPE

I welcome the report on the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States prepared by Mr Őry. Why is that? In this report, the European Parliament has made it very clear what we Europeans can expect in the coming years in the area of work and employment. In addition to the questions of migration and demographic change, the potential for employment in Europe in the area of the so-called ‘green economy’ is a very important issue. This potential can only be exploited successfully if there are sufficient qualified jobs available. This offers a unique opportunity for women at management level in particular. Both men and women have equal opportunities in this dynamic and still relatively new area of business, something that is sometimes more difficult in other areas. It is necessary to ensure that it is possible to balance work and family life, for example, by creating family-friendly jobs and by providing childcare facilities. It must be possible to establish individual models for working hours, as well as part-time arrangements, particularly for those in management positions. Unfortunately, this is not yet possible in all parts of Europe’s labour market. Martin Kastler,

 Mr President, in 2007 and 2008, Libya voted against the United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for a moratorium on executions, and the repeated questioning by human rights organisations elicited no official statements either. It is therefore very important to us that the names of the people who have been executed are now officially revealed at last. Any execution is one too many. We condemn the use of executions and the death penalty. They are inhumane and cruel, and any execution is one too many. In our resolution, therefore, we clearly ask that we change this situation and bring it to light and that we now work together to bring about a change here. No more underreporting. Instead we want transparent information on what happens here and a humane penalty for genuine criminals, but no excessive punishment for those who criticise the regime in Tripoli.

Madam President, around 75% to 80% of all those suffering religious persecution worldwide are Christians. We in the European Parliament are fighting specifically for human rights throughout the world. For me, religious freedom is a central concept of our human rights policy. Therefore, I regret that those on the left and the liberal left in the European Parliament often join together to keep silent about the fate of Christians. At the same time, I am pleased that we are jointly tabling a resolution today about the dreadful situation in Pakistan. Of the 156 million people in Pakistan, 95% are Muslims, around 3% Christians and around 2% Hindus. As a Christian, I would like to focus once again on the situation of the Pakistani Christians, who are subjected to severe persecution. Anyone who allows violent attacks on Christians to take place must receive a response from the civilised world. Therefore, the EU should introduce a criterion in its development policy and economic cooperation which covers this issue and allows sanctions to be applied if necessary. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I have voted in favour of this report and I would like to congratulate Mr Mikolášik on the excellent work he has done. I believe that today is an important day, because we have ensured that donors and recipients of organs will have consistent standards and greater safety.

 Mr President, the citizens of Europe are right. They like honest foods and they like honest politicians. I respect public opinion of this kind. We cannot simply ignore public opinion and we cannot simply dismiss it as populism. That is not the case. We must take notice of what our citizens are saying to us. If our constituents and our citizens are of the opinion that real meat must be real meat and that it must not be made of pieces of meat glued together, then we must make sure that it is not possible for meat to be processed in this way. This is why I have voted against allowing thrombin to be used as a food glue. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted against this report for two reasons. Firstly, I am disturbed that Europe is increasingly taking a scatter-gun approach to development policy and that more and more resolutions and requests are encouraging this approach. Secondly, I have voted against the report, because I believe it is a bad thing for us to try to impose family planning policy on developing and emerging countries in the form of a sort of cultural imperialism. Abortion is not a solution and I regret the fact that some Members of the European Parliament refer euphemistically to ‘reproductive medicine’ when they mean abortion. This does not change the fact that abortion means killing an unborn child. Therefore, I have voted against this report and I hope that in future, we will not use the same euphemistic terms in every resolution and own-initiative report to describe aspects of cultural imperialism. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of those people who has brought one of the first citizens’ initiative petitions into being, specifically, on the subject of protecting Sundays. Today, we have the pleasure of debating – and then deciding upon – a potential way of involving the citizens in the process of Europe’s political work. That means that this is a potential way to bring about more democracy and to counter Europe-fatigue. That said, I am not here just to give praise. Rather, I have two requests to make of you, when you now take this Regulation into its final phase. Firstly, we Europeans are technologically advanced people. I would like to ask you to make the Internet the definitive medium so that a citizens’ initiative with a million signatures is also admissible with electronic signatures, which are also legally binding. Secondly, I would like to point out that what we are doing here is just a first step. I would like to go a step further. We now have a right of initiative for the citizens. It would be my wish, however, for us to also have referendums, as we have in my home region of Bavaria, at the European level in future. What happens is that there is a petition for a referendum, then, when enough people have put their name to it, there is the possibility of a referendum. It would be my wish that we should also have this in Europe. Martin Kastler,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is regrettable that a number of States around the world still, in this day and age, conduct or permit this inhumane kind of punishment for serious criminals. I believe that nobody has the right to decide about the life or death of another person, be it at the beginning or the end of that life, and certainly not in connection with punishing a criminal act. This barbaric punishment by execution has no place in the modern world. The unforgettable, great Pope John Paul II pointed out that, above all, atonement, the chance for reconciliation, must be possible. With an irreversible act such as the death penalty, that is not possible. That is why, as parliamentary groups, we are joining forces to call on our colleagues in South Korea to take up this subject in their parliament and to join with us Europeans to campaign for the abolition of the death penalty, as a mark of humanity. I would like to call on all Members to support this joint motion for a resolution unanimously. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say on behalf of part of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and, above all, on behalf of my colleague, Elmar Brok, that we are shocked that the House has today rejected the amendment which would have included Christians and other religious minorities in this report. I think it is truly outrageous that, although we are constantly making statements on human rights issues, we do not believe it is worth protecting parts of the population who are being persecuted because of their religious background. It is a great pity that we could not accept the amendment which concerns a subject that is of great importance for the future of the world. If we are not able to protect minorities for whatever reason, we no longer have the right to claim that the European Parliament is the home of human rights, of fundamental rights and of this struggle throughout the world. I have voted against this, because religious minorities should not be excluded. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am somewhat surprised that, in this House, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) stands accused of forcing this topic, which, although urgent, is probably not to the liking of any member of the Left majority of this House, onto the agenda. I doubt that they constitute a majority in this House. I simply had to ask that question. Like all the other groups, our group is also perfectly entitled to raise this matter. Even though Mr Chávez, who is currently in power, might be some kind of chum of yours or of the previous Spanish Presidency-in-Office, we still simply have to ask what action is being taken in this regard. I am quite amazed that somebody like Mr Chávez can possibly say things like ‘Twitter is a terrorist system’. I am sorry, but anyone in this day and age who describes Twitter as a terrorist system is living in another world, back in the stone age. Let me tell you this, as well: We, the PPE Group, will not be cowed by this accusation. We denounce violations of human rights everywhere. I personally denounce human rights violations when it comes to freedom of the press. On that score, let me just say that Venezuelan journalists are spoon-fed and dictated to and that judges are thrown into jail if they release someone who has been wrongly arrested. As Europeans, we must have the courage to speak out against such practices. I will not allow Mrs de Keyser and others in this House to pin this accusation on the PPE Group. Like anyone else, we are perfectly entitled to designate violations of human rights and freedoms, whether in Europe or anywhere else across the world, as topics worthy of debate. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I would just like to draw your attention to the fact that all the groups have endorsed this motion for a resolution. That is as it should be, because this topic is very important. In contrast to the previous speakers, I would like to say that we must ensure that we do not merely promote freedom of expression and freedom of the press in this country, but that we also actively demand them, now that we are examining ways that we could help things proceed towards a, hopefully, peaceful election. We have to ensure that we, as Europeans, establish freedom of the press in all areas, with all the financial assistance that is needed to make that possible. We also have to provide full support and endeavour to act together to provide financial assistance, within the scope of the agreements which we have with this country. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 It is commendable that the new Macedonian democracy has made further progress in all areas of society and business. I very much welcome the fact that the presidential and local elections in March 2009 went smoothly. This is an indication of the growing democratisation throughout the entire region which was reflected in Macedonia. Macedonia has met all the criteria for liberalising the visa regulations and, therefore, from 19 December 2009 onwards, its citizens have visa-free status. This represents a major step forward. However, Macedonia still has a number of reforms to implement. I very much hope that we can use the experience which we gathered during the first phase of the eastern enlargement of the EU to help it in this process. In this context, I am thinking of the implementation of institutional reforms, where political foundations and a range of different NGOs have achieved so much. There are two areas where we should strengthen our cooperation with regard to transformation and EU standards. These are reform in the public administration, in the judiciary and in the police. Personally, I would like to see the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece put aside in the immediate future. It is important that progress towards the unification of Europe is not brought to a standstill because of bilateral disagreements. Martin Kastler,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the massacre on 23 November of last year in the Province of Maguindanao in the Philippines was a black day for human rights and a barbaric act of terrorism. Fifty seven people were killed, women were raped, people were injured – they convey a bloody message. As a journalist, it struck me, in particular, that there were 30 journalists among those killed. According to the renowned International Crisis Group, in no other case on record have more journalists ever been murdered at one time. For this reason, it is appropriate for the European Parliament to make a clear statement, as we are doing today in this draft resolution. However, as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we request that the present text be toned down in three places through a split vote, because we ought to support the Philippine Government in its fight against terrorism and violence and therefore dispense with overly accusatory remarks directed at the government. Therefore, on behalf of the PPE Group, I request a separate vote on recital F. This accuses the Philippines of showing all the signs of a non-functional legal system. In paragraph 2, we would like to delete the insinuation about what are referred to as initial delays in the investigation. Finally, in paragraph 6, it is claimed that some missing persons are locked away in Philippine prisons. This, too, is currently an unproven insinuation and should, in our opinion, be deleted.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be voting in favour of this report, as I think that the deepening of cooperation between the European Union and the ACP states within the framework of the partnership agreements is important. That said, I would like to point out that this report contains the wording ‘protection of sexual and reproductive health’. Yet what is behind this phrase? Does it, first of all, mean ensuring people’s physical and mental well-being in relation to all areas of human sexuality and reproduction, for example, by combating sexual violence and genital mutilation? Does it, secondly, mean access to information about what has come to be called family planning? Or, thirdly, does it also include abortion? In the past, the Commission and the Council have made it clear in relation to questions from MEPs that this ‘sexual and reproductive health’ does not include abortion. That is exactly how I see it. I therefore think it important to establish that the term ‘the sexual and reproductive health of women’ is not in the context of abortion and I am therefore proposing a clarification to that effect in the text of the agreement.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what does freedom of religion actually mean? The answer is quite simple. It is the freedom to practise religion. Freedom of religion is not freedom from religion but the freedom to have religion. Freedom of religion does not create a religion-free society, but rather gives people the right to practice their religion openly within society. A crucifix in the classroom does not force anyone to believe, or not to believe. Therefore, it does not violate the freedom of religion. Nor have I ever heard of a right entitling someone not to be confronted with religious symbols. If this were the case, we would, in fact, immediately have to prohibit all crosses on gravestones and all church spires. The crucifix ruling of the European Court of Human Rights is therefore not only an attack on the principle of subsidiarity, but it also violates the right to religious freedom itself. We, the European Parliament, cannot and must not accept this ruling. The European Court of Human Rights should administer justice and not become a puppet for ideological and anti-Christian interests. Otherwise, we will have to seriously consider whether this Court actually still has a purpose at all. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have also voted no, because I am of the opinion that Turkey must first fulfil all the criteria, before we can make such a positive statement here. In particular, I would like to highlight the border dispute between Cyprus and Turkey, which has still not been settled this year, and the illegal occupation of Cyprus, which has not yet been brought to an end. However, I did not want to vote against the other accession candidates. I would particularly make an exception in the case of the Balkan States which I would like to welcome here in this House as soon as possible. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is often the case that good intentions cause problems. No one here would question the fact that non-smokers need comprehensive protection. However, the compromise motion for a resolution on smoke-free environments on which we will be voting on Thursday goes far beyond the protection of non-smokers. Even though the current draft explicitly supports the principle of subsidiarity, it also undermines it. The motion calls for strict and legally binding regulations at EU level. It abuses valid concern for health protection in an attempt to transfer invalid authority in the field of health policy and of work and social issues to a European level. We all want a Europe which is close to its people and the principle of subsidiarity is the key to this. The Member States or, in the case of Germany, the federal states, must have their own discussions on the protection of non-smokers. This is the only way to identify solutions which suit each country’s traditions and culture and are therefore close to its people. For these reasons, I would ask you to vote against the motion for a resolution in its current form on Thursday. Martin Kastler,

Mr President, on 2 October this year, the Iranian police stopped a man from boarding an aircraft at the last minute. The lawyer, Abdolfattah Soltani, was due to receive the International Human Rights Award for 2009 in my home town of Nuremburg for his courageous work on behalf of victims of political persecution. Despite having a valid passport, the Iranian powers refused to allow Mr Soltani to leave the country for no legal reason. His wife was allowed to leave. She rightly stated, and I quote: ‘It pains me that in a country that calls itself a theocracy, acts are committed that have nothing to do with God’. Iran is bound under international law by its ratification of the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which stipulates the human right that everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own. I find it scandalous that Iran is trampling this right underfoot. I am therefore lobbying for the Soltani case to be included in our joint resolution today, in our resolution on Iran, and I ask for your support. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

Mr President, first of all, I agree with fellow Members who have said that old accounts that are still unpaid must be settled. We should do so promptly in order to avoid additional interest which would make them even more expensive. It will not enhance our credibility with the public if we cannot disburse funds that they have applied for and have been granted and to which they are legally entitled.  That is why the amending budget must be formulated as a matter of urgency. The problem that we face for 2013, however, is that if the budget is too low, the amending budget will ultimately be even higher, for the previous year’s commitment appropriations will come back to haunt us, with all their financial implications. I have every understanding for the difficulties posed by crises, but if we genuinely want to make changes, we will have to talk about the commitment appropriations in connection with the multiannual financial framework, and that includes discussing how they should be dealt with. However, the past cannot be dealt with by questioning the law. I am most grateful to the Council and the Cyprus Presidency for engaging in such intensive negotiations. Monika Hohlmeier,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the PPE member responsible for Parliament’s budget, I also want to offer warm thanks to my colleague Derek Vaughan for the close and very fruitful cooperation we have had with all the other shadow rapporteurs. Although Croatia is now also a Member, which has imposed extra costs on the European Parliament, we have managed to stand by a 1.9 % rise, i.e. one that is actually below the normal rate of inflation. To that end, we have also made clear savings in a very wide variety of sectors, which means that we have managed to adopt a draft budget for the European Parliament that is also agreed with the Commission or in line with the Commission’s views. At the same time, however, I would ask those colleagues who may not mean any wrong but basically think we need more and more cuts to the European Parliament’s budget to remember that MEPs must be able to operate under proper working conditions and must also have the chance to review the documents presented by the Commission and proposals such as those put forward by the Member States at the European summit, and then in the end to be able to live with them. We need a competent Parliament, which is why we also need sensible, good and solid funding. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Schengen is one of the greatest achievements in the European Union, however I am also aware that our Member States are sensitive of their borders and are likely to remain so. I am aware that the problems that exist between the Member States in relation to Schengen cannot simply be ignored. These problems are many and varied. Ignoring these problems does not make them any better or easier to resolve. I live near the border with the Czech Republic and no one on our side would ever dream of simply closing the border again when problems are encountered. I would also call on the Commission to offer support in this area, rather than restrictions and rebukes. Dragnet controls were incorporated because we wish to ensure security while still allowing freedom to travel. If we are to be successful in implementing dragnet controls at locations that are frequent crossing points for drug dealers, such as the Czech border in particular, then I believe it is best for the German and Czech interior ministers to sit down together to find a joint solution to the problems that exist at the border. The Commission should not adopt a regulatory role here, but rather a positive supporting role. We wish to rein in the populists, but also to resolve the real problems in a concerted approach. That is why I am also calling on the Council to seek a solution together with Parliament, so that we can successfully conclude the Schengen dossier, upholding freedom to travel while also ensuring the security of our citizens.

 Madam President, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, today, I would like to focus, in particular, on the subject of the agencies. I have noticed that there is no specific focus on financing for the agencies in 2013 or in the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020. To give you a few examples, there are the new supervisory agencies: the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). If these agencies are to do justice to the job which we were discussing once again at the weekend, then they need to be equipped to do it properly, because otherwise, we will ultimately not be able to implement all the plans that we have put in place. Another example is Europol. Europol manages its budget very carefully. In 2011, it had particularly high levels of transfers because some programmes had begun later. The fact that Europol is now being punished with a 10% reduction and is supposed to establish a cybercrime centre with its current funding is simply impossible. We need to ensure that the agencies are properly financed and, at the same time, we need to monitor the management board structures, because I believe that the large number of members on the boards sometimes means that the agencies are managed less efficiently.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to discuss the subject of development aid. The question of budget aid has been a concern for us in the context of development aid for many years. I would like to express my thanks to the Court of Auditors for its numerous very sensible suggestions on this subject. I would also like to thank Commissioner Piebalgs for his increasing efforts to regulate budget aid in a sensible way. Budget aid is appropriate if there is a degree of certainty that the local administration is capable of using this budget aid to implement the projects undertaken in cooperation with the European Union. Secondly, we need to come up with a consistent concept in the area of development aid. I find myself repeating at every discharge hearing that all development aid spending needs to be introduced into the Commission budget at the same time and not just because we want to avoid exceeding the 1% limit. The money will certainly be spent. The question is simply whether it is spent in a coordinated, consistent and mutually agreed way and whether the European Parliament can play a role in spending decisions, rather than just monitoring spending. It is for this reason that I believe it is necessary to focus on the question of long-term and short-term measures in the context of development aid. We need long-term sustainable measures that will lead to improvements in the relevant countries as the years progress. Naturally, we also need short-term measures that can provide rapid relief in response to disasters, such as earthquakes, etc. However, when it comes to long-term projects, we cannot allow standards to be relaxed simply because the conditions in a particular country are not what they might be. Our projects need to make sense and have a purpose, otherwise we will find ourselves spending money for no good reason. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

Madam President, to begin with I would like to thank the European Asylum Support Office which has now started to take highly efficient measures, to give serious help to Greece and to play a very effective role, in particular with regard to what many Members have just called for, in other words, providing reasonable asylum accommodation. A few days ago the Greek Parliament decided that additional accommodation which meets European standards should be built. The European Union will or should give support for this, with the help of the European Asylum Support Office. I believe it is important that we in this Chamber do not constantly talk only about the dreadful things that have happened or the difficulties. Instead we should make it quite clear what we want to do and explain that we are not demanding that Greece comes up with a perfect solution overnight, given its disastrous internal situation. We will be applying realistic standards to the country and to what it is able to achieve. I also think it is sensible that many countries have stopped returning refugees and will continue to do so in future. Secondly, it seems to me to be important for us to extend our cooperation with Turkey. Ms Malmström has said that we are making an effort to do this. I think that amalgamating visa policy and return policy will cause significant problems. However, one possibility might be not to opt for the larger framework for visa policy, but instead to focus only on students and those in similar situations, including business people. This could be a solution for the countries which may currently still have difficulties in this area. Thirdly, we should agree on cooperation between police forces with regard to returning refugees, because this is about combating criminal people traffickers who are making money at the expense of poor refugees. It is not about disagreements with Turkey over questions of content. I hope and believe that Turkey is ready to start cooperating with our police forces on these issues.

Madam President, I believe that we must attempt, in collaboration with the European Asylum Support Office and the Greek authorities, to identify which of the people who have come to Greece could possibly be transferred to other countries within the European Union, firstly, because they can definitely never return to their home country and, secondly, because they may have potential and qualifications which are appropriate and useful. However, this is essentially also about helping the Greeks to register and identify these people more quickly, so that help can be provided sooner and so that those people who do not have qualifications or the entitlement to live in Greece or the European Union can be returned to their home countries, because they do have the opportunity of remaining there.

Mr President, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, ITER is a long-term research project. This means that we cannot simply shelve the treaties that we have entered into and the future plans that we have made in the important area of energy research every time we encounter a crisis or financial difficulties. We cannot decide not to comply with these treaties any longer and to turn a technology of the future into a technology of the past. I was somewhat suspicious about the claim that this technology should be a thing of the past. I was suspicious because we did not make smooth progress during the 30 years of research simply as a result of the fact that 30 years ago we did not have the computer capacity that we have today, which we needed both for materials research and for managing the high temperatures. This is why we have only been able to forge ahead rapidly with the ITER research in recent years. When we launch large projects, we must ensure that they are on a sound financial footing right from the start. This is a lesson which we need to learn within the European Union with regard to a variety of projects. When we start projects, they must have a professional project management team from the very beginning, an accurate and realistic estimate of costs, not simply one which sounds good in political terms, detailed financial controlling, a professional tendering process and a project support and monitoring function which can guarantee us an overview of the actual costs in the short and medium term. This is a long-term research project. It will not be completed in a short period and this is why I believe it is necessary for us not only to continue with this project, but also to acknowledge its future prospects. I have been to Cadarache myself and I have a different impression from yours, Ms Durant. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to give my sincere thanks to Mr Vaughan, the main rapporteur, and also to my fellow rapporteurs. We have worked very closely together and shared detailed information in the attempt to identify sensible solutions which would allow us to take the first step towards producing estimates of revenue and expenditure. I believe that it is very much worth mentioning that the increase in funding for the European Parliament is below the rate of inflation and that we will be carrying out an intensive and systematic evaluation of Parliament’s spending between now and the autumn, in order to identify further potential for cutting costs. In this context, we want to make it very clear to the public that while we are aware that the European Parliament needs a sensible level of resources to be able to work effectively, we also want to exploit every opportunity to introduce savings. From my perspective, this also involves making careful use of money where we take measures relating to the building. In this respect, it is also important to mention that we have already made some initial savings and that we have been able to bring about a significant reduction in some excessive rents. As far as bringing everything together on one site is concerned, I would like to suggest that we calculate the costs and the consequences of moving to one site, rather than just quoting the fictitious costs resulting from the journeys caused by being based at different sites. This will be necessary in order to carry out a useful analysis, since there are officials who do not have to travel at all, because they have no direct connection with Parliament and its work. Under these circumstances, moving to one site would not bring any benefits. We simply need to analyse the situation carefully and impartially. I would like to thank my fellow Members once again, because I believe that we are submitting good estimates. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the nature of the debate in this House shows that we represent the entire spectrum of opinion: on the one side, we have those who do not want restrictions of any kind, while on the other are those who associate any form of immigration with the risk of a massive influx of people. These are the two extremes to be found within the House. Family reunification must be viewed with a great deal of common sense and rationalism. On the one hand, problems genuinely exist in Member States with excessively restrictive policies. After all, we cannot put so many obstacles in the way of reuniting families that, in the end, reunification becomes an impossibility. On the other hand, Member States are fully justified in demanding language skills and integration, for example, or at least a willingness to integrate within a state. Secondly, the Member States naturally have the right to point out the problems that arise with family reunification, problems that should not be swept under the carpet. If countries like Greece, Malta, Romania or Italy are no longer permitted to indicate the problems they experience in this context, then I am not certain that we are taking a democratic approach by simply ignoring problems. We do not need another new directive. We should debate the problems carefully and then consider how we can remedy them. The continuous production of new directives will not lead to an improvement in the directives or their implementation. We are currently experiencing implementation problems in some areas. I completely understand that we need to engage in debate first, rather than drawing up yet another new directive and adding something to it before we have thoroughly discussed the old directive and the associated problems. I am in favour of listening to the Member States and of respecting the basic right of family reunification. If this is done in a reasoned and understanding way, then we will also achieve some progress. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by sincerely thanking my colleague, the rapporteur Mr Vaughan, for his excellent cooperation and his readiness to discuss the various problems in depth and to find a solution. We already presented an austerity budget last year, in which the actual original budget only rose by 0.8% and, in view of the additional costs incurred through the accession of Croatia and the Treaty of Lisbon, we still remained below the inflation rate of 1%, achieving 1.9%. This year, we are again publishing guidelines for an austerity budget, seeking to show that we are aware that we are in an environment in which it is not possible to make enormous financial leaps forward, but rather that consolidation is the order of the day, so that the budget will need to be examined in terms of efficiency and the potential for cutting costs. I also welcome the convening of a working group that is to bring in external experts as deemed necessary and useful, to work in this direction with the Bureau, the Secretariat and Parliament’s administration. I also believe it is right for us to further strengthen interinstitutional cooperation and that we should further optimise the way in which Parliament works in terms of organisation, efficiency, the use of financial resources and personnel. This has enabled us to save EUR 21 million in the area of translation and interpreting alone in a single year and we want to continue in this vein this year. As Mr Vaughan has said, we are freezing travel costs and day-to-day expenses and, with regard to buildings policy – after all I am the rapporteur on buildings – I believe it necessary for us to examine closely what we have agreed to see whether buildings policy and construction projects are being managed in a professional, cost-efficient manner. The particular aim will be to save costs in the medium term, in particular annually recurring costs, and to exploit the relevant synergies. We also expect the other institutions to join us in our efforts and to offer their support. I believe it is necessary for us to navigate a course in which the precise work of Parliament is linked with efficiency and good organisation. I would like to thank the Parliament administration, the Secretariat and the Bureau for their excellent cooperation and hope that we succeed in presenting a reasonable, solid and well-considered budget.

We voted against the report on the recasting of the regulation on public access to documents. The report goes far beyond the objective of achieving greater transparency by improving public access to documents. Existing legislation and interinstitutional agreements are ignored and the protection of intellectual property, sensitive and personal data is treated with contempt. Administrative processes and decisions, including those relating to personnel issues, should be published. The same applies to the protection of trade secrets and sensitive information within the framework of approval procedures, court proceedings and competition procedures. The report contains definitions that are vague, lack clarity and cast their net too widely. Any data or content connected in any way with the policies, measures and decisions of all bodies and institutions of the EU is defined as a document. This largely also includes preparatory, confidential and secret documents, as well as all associated information. Thus, the definition covers not only documents, but also information. The publication of information from ongoing interinstitutional processes, such as informal trialogue negotiations, enables public access to the procedure. This would open up the possibility of external influence. Lobbyists would have direct access to the legislative process. This report does not benefit our citizens. It would lead to a deluge of useless information, leading to a greater lack of transparency and rendering our work impossible. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, Ms Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control have both paid great attention to ensuring that in future the ITER project will be well managed, its finances will be monitored, its funding will be properly evaluated and the financial increases will be kept within reasonable bounds. However, I believe it is a major problem, in the case of a project established jointly by the Member States, which the Member States have decided on in the Council, when the Council opts in the same breath to increase research funding and extend the financing available for research and this results in cuts in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, in order to make more money available for ITER. This was not what was originally decided on by the Member States. Agreement was reached in the trialogue and my admiration goes to the rapporteur who showed the patience of a saint in attempting to ensure that progress was made in the negotiations. I would like to know how we in Europe are supposed to improve our global reputation when we demonstrate that we are lacking in unity and unable to agree in the context of a large international project. Making a note of this kind in the minutes about an amount of EUR 360 million, which retrospectively calls into question a joint compromise reached in the trialogue, is a simply disgraceful way of presenting ourselves to the rest of the world. We should see ITER as a really important project and Parliament is prepared to do this. However, in this case the Member States need to make some sensible proposals on financing the decision that they have reached, without once again interfering with the field of research. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am rather bewildered to hear some fellow Members saying that this directive would allegedly encourage unchecked mass immigration. The reality is the exact opposite. We are talking here about those with a proper work and residence permit, and if they are doing the same work as an EU citizen, then such people should also receive the same usual types of social benefits within the European Union as any other person would get. This safeguards those who work properly and with the right papers; it is not opening any floodgates. I also find it most amusing that some Members are complaining that too many groups are excluded, while others are complaining that mass immigration will take place. I congratulate the rapporteur. She seems to have found the golden middle way between giving the Member States the necessary individual powers of differentiation in certain decision areas and, on the other hand, providing a certain guarantee of social security for those working according to the rules. It should be a matter of course that family benefits depend on length of stay, but that someone who has earned a pension is able to take it with them if they have worked according to the rules. I therefore find it rather strange that people’s concerns that many workers will be crowded out of the labour market are being fuelled here. This directive has nothing to do with that. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in contrast to the previous speaker, I would like to begin by observing that, in my view, the European Parliament does not wish to express a resolution of no confidence in the Council. In other words, the motion that we are tabling does not mean that we have a lack of confidence in the Council or assume that funds are misspent. I do have a concern that the Council should give much more consideration to stronger cooperation with Parliament and collaboration between the three institutions. I will illustrate with an example. I am the rapporteur for real estate. It would be highly beneficial if the three institutions would coordinate with each other much better when it comes to buildings. The taxpayers would also be grateful, as perhaps then we could act more effectively and more in concert instead of as three institutions doing everything separately. The same applies, as I see it, to interpreters and other areas. We should work together. The general population can no longer be expected to understand how we do not even answer each other’s questions. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to thank Bulgaria and Romania for the impressive efforts that they have made. They have not only fulfilled the technical details of the Schengen Agreement, but have also taken very specific measures at their borders in order to safeguard the external borders of the European Union. The claim that they have only met the small-scale technical requirements is simply wrong. Everyone can go to these borders and see what Bulgaria and Romania have done to bring about a massive improvement in standards and in education and training and to see the measures that have been taken to secure the external borders. In my opinion, their efforts have been significantly underestimated. Secondly, the subject of corruption has repeatedly been mentioned, together with organised crime. I think it is right for us to discuss these matters and I also think it is right for us to take serious measures to combat corruption and organised crime within the context of the Schengen Agreement. However, laying the responsibility solely at the door of Bulgaria and Romania is wrong. There are also significant problems relating to corruption and organised crime within the Schengen countries. Therefore, against this background, and with regard to securing the external borders, I am calling specifically for the fulfilment of the Schengen Agreement in all the Member States to be evaluated, because it is necessary to ensure that all the Schengen countries meet the requirements, not only those which want to join. We need long-term safeguards and not simply short-term demands on two Member States. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur and Mr Klinz and, in particular, our coordinator Mr Karas, who has ensured that this is not only a balanced report, but also contains many passages that make worthwhile reading and that are essential for the future of the European Union and its 27 Member States. In today’s climate of global competition, it is no longer possible for every Member State to go it alone. I believe that competition is an important and necessary instrument. However, I also believe it is important for our 27 Member States to have joint strategies for the globalised financial markets and in relation to our major competitors on the other continents. I am not in favour of more Europe across the board, but I do advocate more Europe in areas where the 27 can only succeed by pooling their efforts. In this context, we have discussed key points in relation to the financial markets, pointing out, in particular, that we cannot achieve greater economic growth simply through financial trading, but rather that the answer lies in coordinated and sustainable economic activity. For this reason, I find this to be a very good report. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I would like to raise two points in relation to cohesion policy and regional policy. The first is the dispute regarding the so-called intermediate category, which runs very much along national lines. I believe it is essential for us to consider the following points in relation to this discussion: regional policy and economic development policy must offer an incentive system so that the relevant regions can develop. If the system is set up in such a way that a dependency on continuous subsidy develops without requiring effort among the regions to obtain the relevant resources, then I believe that such an intermediate category would be an unmitigated disaster because it will always be a bone of contention and offers no rationale. However, I do believe that it makes sense for Objective 1 regions that lose their Objective 1 status to continue to receive special support. I also believe it makes sense that a region that is experiencing financial and economic difficulties for specific reasons should also receive support. What we do not want is a continuous subsidy mentality; instead we should offer help and support to the regions that need it. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by saying something about the comments on the House of European History. As rapporteur for buildings I would firstly like to say that the figure of EUR 136 million is definitely incorrect. Secondly, we are not talking about a prestige project here; after all, we are constantly complaining that people know nothing of European development since the Second World War, and we now want to make sure that two to three million people a year get to know these developments and find out more about them – so that perhaps they will be less Eurosceptic. We should debate together the level of the operating costs and the synergies that may be able to be realised with the information centre. A great many Members have taken part in the debate. However, the debate has only just become public, with the result that some Members do not yet feel they have been adequately informed. I will be happy to provide assistance with such discussions or requests for information. I consider the project to be necessary and useful, because people need to find out more about European development – otherwise there will be more and more Eurosceptics. Secondly, on the subject of development aid. I would first like to thank Mr Staes warmly for the fact that we have genuinely achieved a joint report in many, many respects that I can categorically support. I consider it essential that we set development aid priorities in the areas of infrastructure, health, education and particularly agriculture, and in particular I think that perhaps we should consider introducing an evaluation of projects after 10 years. It is not our aim to start only short-term projects that in the final event have no lasting effect. Moreover, we should make sure that we achieve better coordination of development aid with the Member States and also are able to implement once and for all the integration of the entire development aid budget into the EU budget, because it is incomprehensible why only part of our development aid is included in the EU budget. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Madam President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, the House’s budget for 2012 is set against the background of a difficult economic and financial situation. That is why I see it as a positive development that we have agreed in the basic guidelines that Parliament’s budget is to be drawn up carefully within the framework of only modest increases and that adjustments should not exceed the inflation rate. I believe the target mentioned by Mr Fernandes, in relation to youth employment is very important because in our last budget we were very concerned that more money should be provided for youth than was previously the case because it is young people in particular who are affected by unemployment or who need special support, including from Europe. That is why I believe the additional EUR 100 million is a very positive approach. As the rapporteur on buildings, I would particularly like to point out that I believe it is extremely important for us to maintain a high level of efficiency in relation to the financing of our buildings and to monitor the financial situation with care. In this context I believe it is right that financial resources that cannot be spent on Parliament’s budget over the course of the year should be used as prudently as possible to avoid interest payments. In this regard it is also necessary to ensure that the monies are not spent in a mad rush at the end of the year, but rather that they are used to pay off buildings more quickly and more economically. In relation to the House of European History, we shall ensure that the operating plan is carefully examined once again and that the construction costs are closely monitored so that, crucially, an orderly budget can also be presented after the building is complete following notification in accordance with Article 179(3). Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks for the many talks we were able to have with the rapporteur and also with the Commissioner and shadow rapporteurs. This enabled good compromises to be reached in some areas. As Mrs Malmström just mentioned, this includes the compromise on free legal assistance, in particular, for the special protection of minors. Other achievements include the fact that we were able to agree on which applicants were particularly worthy of protection and, in our talks with one another, we were able to find a sensible compromise. Over and above that, we also found a compromise with regard to the subject of safe third countries. The aim is to fundamentally improve the quality of the administrative procedures so that there are fewer hearings in court in the second and third instance, in order to provide asylum seekers who are genuinely facing persecution with as rapid and as consistently effective assistance and protection as possible. I am strongly in favour of there being appropriate minimum standards in all Member States. Unfortunately, however, both the Commission’s text and some of the individual amendments intended to amend the Commission’s text to a certain extent do the opposite of what this good intention is striving to achieve. Many opportunities have been created to delay procedures or even to massively abuse asylum law. I will give you a few examples of this. For example, an applicant can make three inadmissible applications and has the right to go through the full procedure three times. Only then can an accelerated procedure be carried out. A procedure cannot be accelerated if someone is clearly not recognised as a refugee under the Geneva Convention. In this regard, I would simply mention the subject of Tunisia and also that of economic migrants. Another example is the fact that an accelerated procedure will also not be possible if subsequent applications are made without any relevant new content. What I consider to be even more serious, however, is the subject of disappearing. If someone illegally disappears, his application can no longer be closed with a negative decision. He has to countersign the letter. Therefore, if an asylum seeker were expecting news of a negative decision, all he would need to do – if we were to adopt the motion put forward by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – would be to refuse to accept the letter or not be there to receive it. The consequence of that would be that he could prolong the procedure indefinitely. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE
).

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the 2012 budget is set against the background of a difficult economic and financial situation in the 27 Member States. For this reason, we will certainly not be able to afford to do everything that we would like to do. I believe that the report tabled by Mrs Balzani is a workable compromise. However, I also have a few critical remarks to make. In my opinion, more money does not necessarily mean more solidarity and more Europe. What is important is to improve the quality of what we get in return for the money spent and above all to ensure that the objectives we set ourselves are actually achieved rather than the money merely being paid out regardless. We must always examine the question of our potential new own resources with a critical eye, too. These own resources must not lead to the additional burdening of citizens or of businesses that need to be, and should be, able to compete with the rest of the world. I also think it is important for us not always to emphasise the fact that the EU budget amounts to only 2% because, at the end of the day, many States cofinance the corresponding European funds, thus, of course, making a considerably larger volume of funds available on the basis of EU programmes. I think it is particularly important for us to make progress in terms of research, education, sustainability and strengthening economic growth. In light of this, I think it is also important for large-scale projects such as ITER – and in this regard I would like to thank Mrs Jensen for her comment – to be fully and clearly financed and clearly managed, because otherwise the Americans, who are currently implementing the same project, will be appreciably ahead of us, and we Europeans should not always take second place. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to express my regret and dismay that neither the Secretary-General nor the two vice-presidents with responsibility for the European Parliament are present. We normally expect from the Commission that its responsible members should be present; we should also expect the same from our most senior representative. Secondly, I would like to address the subject of the management of the House’s buildings. I welcome the fact that the KAD project in Luxembourg is making progress, that it would seem that the costs are under control, and that things are going according to plan. When the KAD extension project is complete, bringing staff together under one roof should lead to greater efficiency and synergy, as well as reducing annual costs, because eight offices will be closed. It is essential that this target should be met as we need some of these funds for other purposes, as Mr Fernandes has pointed out. I believe that the House of European History is an important project because it will attract many visitors, who will be offered an insight into the significance, aims and purpose of the European Union in the context of European history in a very effective way. Thirdly, I would ask that the staff appointed in Luxembourg should be relocated to Brussels. Because they frequently need to work in Brussels, they are constantly travelling back and forth, also causing problems for the Members. This only applies to a small number of sub-areas and relocation really should be considered on efficiency grounds. Fourthly, I think it a very good thing that the European Parliament is only making provision for moderate expansion. The fact that other areas are only expanding on a modest scale should not be taken by the EEAS as a reason for massive expansion. I would call on all institutions to cut their cloth to their measure in these times of economic and financial difficulty. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, it is important that the EU comes to grips with the problems of migration and the right of asylum. The Commission has submitted proposals in this area. However, there is currently no accurate analysis of the implementation of existing legal provisions. There are also hardly any detailed calculations and analyses concerning the new proposals. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wholeheartedly supports the right of asylum and the right to protection for people who need it. However, when we look at the actual situation, it is unfortunately clear that people are applying for asylum for very different reasons or even systematically abusing the system. The right of asylum and subsidiary protection is not a tool for general migration into the 27 Member States. We must ensure that the organised people traffickers do not have the opportunity to make billions of euro in profit out of people’s fates as a result of our right of asylum. Asylum procedures must be fit for purpose and they must be implemented with great care. Victims of persecution must be guaranteed a refuge in the EU. This is why the Commission’s obligations in this respect are laid down in the new drafts. I think many of them are appropriate, including interpreters, proper healthcare and taking into consideration special protection needs. However, I would also like to mention the points which I believe are problematic. The authorities in the Member States are being given far too few opportunities to prevent abuse. The option of the accelerated procedure and the border procedure should be restricted by applying charges. If an applicant commits a serious breach of his duty of cooperation, there are very few possibilities of imposing sanctions. On the contrary, if an asylum seeker disappears, the Member State cannot bring the procedure to a negative conclusion. If he reappears, he is offered an extended range of procedural options. Even if an application is obviously without any foundation, the use of the accelerated procedure will only be possible after the second subsequent application. This will lead to significant cost increases. The current Commission draft states that free legal advice will be available from a lawyer, which will also result in the Member States’ costs rising considerably. I would simply like the Commission to reconsider the practical consequences of its proposals, the financial impact and the problems for the authorities in the Member States. We want to see a system with high standards, but it must be workable and should not present already overburdened Member States with completely impossible tasks. Monika Hohlmeier,  
author.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, thank you very much for allowing me to speak again briefly. I have a request for you, Mr Füle. I would like to start by saying that incorrect assumptions lead to incorrect cost estimates. At the moment, the number of asylum seekers is not falling, but rising significantly. This is a result of visa facilitation, for example, for Serbia and Macedonia. We are currently also seeing a massive increase in abuses of the asylum system as part of attempts to enter countries in the European Union. If you start with incorrect assumptions, in other words, that disputing the first instance in detail will save costs in subsequent instances, it will automatically seem as if all Member States have poor first-instance procedures. However, that is not the case. If overall standards are raised, the consequence will be cost increases. Improving the standard of quality for everyone and making the procedures more complex will, in reality, result in increased costs. I am more than happy to discuss this point. Therefore, I would like to ask you specifically to take the concerns of the countries seriously, because some of the practical reports from the countries have already been completed and will be distributed. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to make it clear, following repeated claims in this House, that during the budget negotiations, we have not requested a single cent more than the Council had offered us. This means that we were completely in line with the Council’s wishes. On the subject of the flexibility instrument, we need it because the Council regularly gets us into difficulties with its decisions on major projects for which it has not made provision for the funding. We then have to attempt, together with the Member States, to find a solution for these projects, in order to be able to support them financially and to make sensible plans. We have also not demanded more than what is laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. Instead, we are calling for compliance with the treaty. Nothing else, nothing more and nothing less. On the subject of own resources, it is surely not asking too much for Parliament to say that it would at least like to discuss the issue, what form it could take and whether own resources are in place. They cannot simply refuse to talk about this and then put the blame on Parliament. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE
).  
– (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, later on, we will be attending the reception for the deepening of relations between the European Union and the United States. The fact that this is happening today of all days is particularly significant. All of us will then have the opportunity to tell the ambassador what we have just underlined here in plenary. We ought to take the opportunity to do this in person. The United States of America is not making our work particularly easy at the moment, and it is not making our friendship very easy, either. On many issues, I have the impression that what we are seeing is more like a bull in a china shop than a performance on the elegant political stage. The EUR 14 alone is certainly not a decisive factor. However, if a family with three children wants to visit the United States of America, it then becomes a considerable amount and may ultimately prevent them from travelling there. On top of that, if you have to give extensive details on the Internet about which airline you are travelling with, where you are travelling to, which hotel you are staying in and, in addition, you have to give your credit card number, it raises a number of questions as to why all of this is necessary. If, in addition, you then hear the accounts of some good acquaintances who have had to wait for hours at American airports and experience the discourteous security control, then you sometimes ask yourself whether the United States of America is actually aware that in many areas, it is currently treating its own friends rather discourteously and perhaps, in certain respects in relation to what people actually need and have to do, it is way off the mark. Furthermore, with regard to our close transatlantic relations, I have to say that we do have a close relationship with the United States. However, this should also mean that we are treated accordingly. I call on the Commission and on you, Mr Šefčovič, to make a clear demand for visa-free travel to be ensured for those Member States that do not currently enjoy this facility, and if this is not followed by an appropriate reaction, then please also demand that reciprocity be introduced. It is not a question of ‘an eye for an eye’, but we must negotiate on equal terms and we must not allow ourselves to be treated in the same way that a feudal lord would treat his serfs. We are not serfs; we are of equal stature. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I note that the Council does not wish to debate the multiannual financial framework. May I tell the Council that the European Parliament would very much like to debate it, and that the Council cannot act as if it is in a kindergarten by telling us that it will not answer our questions or comment on our proposals. Secondly, in this connection, I must ask the Council whether it wants to have Lisbon or not. Lisbon is not a mere technical adjustment; it imposes more competences and means there are more responsibilities to discharge – and that includes answering related financial questions. Moreover, the Council has taken decisions that result in new financial expenditure. That has been mentioned by many of my fellow Members. If the Council wishes to do this, and if it does not want more money to be spent, then it must also state quite specifically where and how it wishes savings to be made, where exactly these funds are to be shifted from – and not simply propose general percentages to be redeployed while leaving Parliament and the Commission with the unpleasant task of deciding where the money is to be taken from, especially since our opportunities for redeployment and budgetary revision are extremely limited. The additional responsibilities that you have imposed on us are so challenging that they do not involve small incidental amounts – I will merely mention the area of the financial solidarity of our Member States and their corresponding financial difficulties. If the programme is to be implemented, then we are not taking about small sums that can be redeployed without further consideration. The same applies to ITER, the same applies to matters of internal security, the same applies to significant matters relating to research, the same also applies to questions concerning Parliament’s priority areas such as youth training and research. We have to deal not only with shortcomings in implementation, but also with a lack of transparency when it comes to the disbursement of funds. We need to debate and work through all these matters quite specifically; the Council cannot simply keep silent on them. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all of the Member States of the European Union are suffering under the burden of huge debts and from the effects of the financial and economic crisis. However, they are also suffering as a result of the fact that, for years, high budget deficits – some of which are excessive – have been accepted and tolerated in a large number of countries. When we start to tackle the new 2011 budget it is not enough merely to reduce the budgets of the Member States. We also need to undertake a thorough review of the expenditure from our budget and also carefully review new expenditure. I would mention the European External Action Service, the structure and also the financing of which is still extremely unclear. There is no transparent structure. I would also call for cost-efficiency by using the synergies with national external action services. There must be clear rules regarding responsibilities and a transparent rendering of accounts to the European Parliament, and attempts should not be made to void the European Parliament’s codecision and supervision roles in more and more decisions. The European Parliament is cooperative and will also be supportive in difficult situations. For this reason, we must also involve the European Parliament in these matters as co-decision-maker. Furthermore, I think it is necessary for us at last to make the reduction in bureaucracy a reality, for example in agriculture and also for small and medium-sized enterprises, which urgently need to grow and to implement and cope with innovations. If we want to reduce budgetary deficits, as well as taxes, and increase tax revenues, we need to reduce the burden of bureaucracy on small and medium-sized enterprises and enable innovation, and we must finally reduce the merciless competition exerted by large-scale industry on unpopular small and medium-sized enterprises, and not encourage it. I also share the view of the Chair of our Committee on Budgets that we first need precise data regarding this budget before we can finally adopt it. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to discuss the problems with development aid that are nearly always emphasised by the Court of Auditors and to thank Mrs Ayala Sender for her good cooperation that was remarkably pleasant. Firstly, there is often the problem of budget support. That means that there is even suspicion that in countries where we are trying to help the population a little, budget support is partly being used by corrupt and totalitarian regimes to suppress undesirable population groups or even critics. I am extremely critical of this budget support. It should be reduced or stopped for countries in which we clearly have problems with the use of budget support. Secondly, now as before, we have the problem that the payments often contain errors, that there is a lack of coordination and targeting of development aid projects between the different institutions and levels in one country and there is no recognisable setting of priorities. It is essential that this is made a matter of priority, so that we can improve the sustainability and effectiveness of projects in those countries where people really are in dire need. Furthermore, now as before, I consider it essential that development aid and the European Development Fund in general are integrated into the overall budget. On pre-accession aid for Turkey I would like to say that I was surprised that the completely normal criticism which, in other countries, would have long since led to the blocking and withholding of financing, has led so quickly to a hiccup in the cooperation between Turkey and the Commission. I consider it completely normal that we firstly lay down the strategy and the goals, then the timeframes, the project orientation, the yardsticks for measuring and then the method of performance monitoring. However, if all of this is lacking and projects are implemented that are then declared successful, I have a problem with the way the programme is implemented. For this reason, I personally consider it necessary that at least part of the funding is withheld until it we have suitable assurances that the funds will be properly spent. We have now reached a compromise, but I consider it necessary to monitor the problem, since other countries like Bulgaria, Romania or Greece will be affected. I think it is necessary that everyone be treated in the same way and not differently. Therefore, I ask that in the area of buildings policy, provision be made for a medium-term building strategy by means of clear construction and financial planning. Large projects should receive their own budget lines and a reporting system related to construction progress, and we should not pay any more costs for bridging lenders. As we are such large institutions, we need buildings and they must be planned carefully and transparently. My last point is that I believe it is necessary to simplify the programmes as a matter of urgency, since that is how problems in the respective countries arise, and this must not simply remain a rhetorical demand, but must finally be implemented. (Applause) Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unlike the previous speaker, I would expressly like to thank both Commissioner Malmström and Commissioner Reding for their intensive efforts to take up the issues that have been raised by Parliament, as well as the problems that we see and have seen in the area of data security and confidentiality, in order to negotiate with the United States. I am also grateful that key issues – as mentioned by my fellow Members – have already been analysed or considered in the mandate and that, in particular, this also includes issues in the area of inspection as well as the area of reciprocity. On the matter of the erasure of data, I also consider it very important to be able to renegotiate the five-year period, since it is really not acceptable to hold data for such a long time. I also feel it is important to ultimately discuss the matter of penalties in cases of deliberate extraction to the wrong ends in sensitive circumstances, since that prevents certain things being extracted that we do not want to see extracted. The focus should only be on terrorism. To me, what is also important is the idea that we have to tackle our own TFTP and that in the longer term, we cannot transfer bulk data, that is to say, large amounts of data to the United States. That has nothing to do with mistrust, but the fact that in the long term, we ultimately want to take our own responsibility within Europe on an equal footing, and then exchange specific extracted data for the sole purpose of combating terrorism and finally maintain real reciprocity. In this context, I would again like to ask the Commission to indicate how the topic of our own TFTP is viewed within the Commission and in the joint discussion with the Council.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am astonished by the discussion on the part of fellow Members who, on the one hand, speak of simplifications for small and medium-sized enterprises, but who, when it comes to taking the very first step for micro-entities – and that is all we are talking about today, not about any other scale – are already inclined to say no again. We cannot always demand something and then subsequently say no. I have spoken with many micro-entities. They are hoping and waiting for this regulation. I have spoken to regional banks, who stressed very clearly to me that it would not be a problem for them at all if financial reporting was changed; they use other data any way. Furthermore, there will be absolutely no change in terms of transparency, because – as the Commissioner has explained – provisions will remain in force so that transparency is also maintained. Trade will not be affected, because the micro-entities do not have an impact on the European market in the sense of trading throughout Europe. I call on fellow Members to take this step with us and thank Mr Lehne and the committee for their excellent work. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 My decision to vote against the interim SWIFT agreement is not a decision against cooperation with the USA on combating terrorism. I emphatically advocated that a new, compatible agreement that would allow European and US security authorities to work closely together and enable them to detect money transfers with suspected links to terrorism should be created as swiftly as possible. However, there are major flaws in the interim agreement, including inadequate provisions as regards data deletion, rights of complaint and access to information and onward transmission to third parties. Moreover, what I expect from a genuine partnership between the European Union and the USA is one which does not merely leave the responsibility for ensuring security of citizens within the framework of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (TFTP) in US hands, but which also provides a clearly defined time-frame for the development of a European TFTP, in partnership with the USA, within the European Union, as well. For this reason, I hope that an agreement will be negotiated, in the nearest future, which still provides a long-term basis for jointly combating terrorism worldwide, in terms of detecting terrorist networks and their financial transactions, but which respects citizens’ data privacy, as well.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the focus until now has been on the cohesion fund and this is certainly justified because of the size of the budget. However, I would now like to draw attention to an area in which only EUR 2.7 billion was spent last year, but which causes significant problems. The European Court of Auditors, which I would like to thank warmly at this point, has produced a semi-masterpiece, as it has succeeded in bringing transparency to the fragmented administration in the area of development aid and in clearly identifying the problems which continue to occur. I would not like to go as far as saying that this area has no universal principle and no transparent structures, but it does have considerable problems. There have been improvements, for example, in the payments for projects, but nevertheless it is still the case that no audits can be carried out on some of the projects because the receipts are missing, not to mention the fact that some receipts are not even provided in the first place or that there are no opportunities for follow-up audits. The subject of budget aid once again involves particular problems because it is not possible to follow up or trace the money and what it is used for. In my opinion, we should carefully consider finally integrating the European Development Fund (EDF) into the general budget, for reasons of transparency, traceability and manageability. This would allow us to combine and coordinate the EDF with other fields, such as development aid, foreign policy, neighbourhood policy and other policies in the same area, so that we could obtain a complete and transparent overview. This is my proposal.Albert Deß,

 Mr President, Ms Reding, ladies and gentlemen, a secure supply of sugar for the European market must be the top priority of European sugar policy. The reform of the sugar regime in 2006 made the European Union dependent on imports, at least in part. Ms Reding has just mentioned the figures. The result of the reform is that imports amounting to 15% of consumption are now needed on a permanent basis. However, after the imports fell below expected levels because of poor harvests in some important sugar producing countries and the resulting rise in world market prices, the Commission has, in my opinion, taken the right measures. It has made importing additional amounts of sugar easier. More than 500 000 tonnes have been imported without duty being paid. It has also enabled domestic producers of sugar and isoglucose to sell part of their non-quota production on the food market. The amount in this case is also 500 000 tonnes. Against this background, it is clear that the Commission has achieved the balance referred to in the questions. I very much support what Ms Reding has said in this respect. The sugar market regime has the necessary instruments to secure the supply and to guarantee a fair balance across the different interests. The risk of redundancies has been mentioned, in particular, by the first speaker, and I would like to refer to what Mr Tarabella said. Thousands of jobs were lost during the reform of the sugar regime. In my constituency in the Upper Palatinate area of Germany, one of the oldest sugar refineries in Europe was closed with the loss of hundreds of jobs. Our goal must not be to ensure that every single job is secure, despite the fact that I regret every redundancy. Instead, we must ensure that there is a balance. I believe it will be good for the sugar regime reform to be extended until 2020. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Albert Deß  (PPE

Thank you, Ms Ludford. In the past, we had excessively high sugar prices in Europe. During the reform of the sugar regime in 2006 and also beforehand, sugar beet prices in Europe fell by around 40%. This meant that sugar beet producers suffered massive cuts. There have been major fluctuations in prices on the world market. There was a time when sugar was much more expensive on the world market than in Germany. At that point, none of the African, Caribbean and Pacific states were supplying Europe. The problem was that there were inconsistencies. Ms Ludford, if we in Europe abolish the sugar regime, we will be even more exposed to fluctuations in prices and European consumers will have to pay a bitter price. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, as one of the few people in this Chamber to have actually been a lorry driver myself, I voted against this today, even though Mr Higgins has done some good work. There were two main reasons for this. Firstly, it was because Parliament voted in favour of Amendment 134, which lowered the tonnage limit of the vehicles from 3.5 tonnes to 2.8 tonnes. I consider that excessive; it was not necessary. Above all, in the end I voted against the motion because Amendment 129 was rejected. This amendment called for the radius for approved exemptions to be extended to 150 kilometres. I am from the Upper Palatinate. Munich is 130 kilometres away. My tradesmen work in Munich a great deal, and now they have to install tachographs because they work in Munich. I am particularly annoyed that the only other Member from the Upper Palatinate region, Ismail Ertug, voted against the interests of tradesmen in our region on these two points. I have great hopes that this will be corrected again at second reading, so that tradesmen who work in areas some distance away from their own will not be disadvantaged. Albert Deß  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner Dalli, I am very pleased that you are here because I know that you are always sympathetic to our concerns. It is very good that you should be made aware of the problems of milk producers. Opinions differ on the milk quota, even within my own group. I often find myself in agreement with my colleague from Luxembourg, Ms Lulling, however we differ on this point. We, the nine representatives of the German conservative group (CSU) from the last electoral term, already voted en bloc against increasing the quota in 2008. The esteemed Commissioner at the time, Ms Fischer Boel, understood the term ‘soft landing’ to mean an increasing of the quota. Increasing the quota means more volume and more volume means lower prices. This is a fairly simple formula. This is precisely the problem we are faced with at present because there are farmers in the European Union who are delivering too much quota, causing a distortion in the milk market. I am against reducing the super levy or increasing the quota even further, because dairy farmers also need some contractual security. The quota will be phased out on 31 March 2015 and we need contractual security by then. We also need other important systems, Mr Dalli: fixed payment deadlines, net-net prices and binding supply volumes. These are the key points we need to work on in order to prepare for a market without quotas. Albert Deß  (PPE
),  
Blue-card question.

 Mr Ferreira, I have just one brief supplementary question: Did you know that in 2008, when the Council discussed increasing the quota, Portugal also voted in favour of this expansion and that only two countries were against increasing the quota, namely Germany and Austria? France abstained from voting. Twenty-four countries, including Portugal, voted to increase the quota, thereby undermining the quota system. Albert Deß  (PPE
).

Mr President, thank you; I asked to speak because we still have some time left. I will be brief. I would like everyone who talks about the absolute freedom of the milk market, whether from my own group or from other groups, to take the following to heart: from 2015 onwards we shall also have to discontinue the historical payments per hectare. We cannot have a situation where milk producers in Latvia receive EUR 100 per hectare, while producers in other countries receive over EUR 1 000 on the basis of historical premiums. This does not constitute fair competition. A milk producer who receives compensation payments of EUR 1 000 per hectare can sell his milk to the market at a lower price, thus distorting the market. That cannot be allowed to happen. Starting from 2015, we must pay the same hectare premiums for all milk producers in the first pillar. We can expect some interesting discussions. My second comment relates to the market: we need to strengthen the position of producers and processors in relation to the retail sector. I fully support this. We cannot have a situation where milk producers and processors have to pay premiums and listing discounts and payments are delayed by periods of up to 100 days. Commissioner Dalli, we need to step in here to strengthen the position of producers and dairy farmers as a whole. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Albert Deß  (PPE

 Thank you for your question, Mr Bové. I myself am the president of a large dairy cooperative that markets milk for 7 000 dairy farmers and only the dairy farmers themselves have a say in the business, in other words the directors and the members of the supervisory board are all farmers. Unfortunately, we do not have enough leverage in the market to impose our prices on these wholesale chains. What we find particularly disturbing, and what causes prices to drop, are the unfair methods employed by others. There are no net-net prices. Discounts have to be given at the end of the year. Listing fees are demanded in the interim. In other words, it is impossible to compare the prices paid by the retailers because they are undermined by these systems. The Commission should look for clear-cut systems that would make the whole system more transparent and easier to understand. This would also allow us to protect our own interests more effectively.

Blue-card answer.

Mr President, I believe that the present problem is not that we do not have enough milk, but rather that we have too much. The problem is that some farmers are supplying much more than their quota permits. The aim of Ms Lulling and a number of other colleagues is to abolish or reduce the super levy. I disagree with them on this. This provision lasts up to 2015 and a number of dairy producers have spent money in recent months in order to purchase quotas. These people would be penalised if we were now to do away with the entire system. We must provide contractual security. Contractual security means that the status quo must be maintained until 2015, in other words that any force the quota may still have should remain in place until then. We need to consider what market measures we take after 2015. I must say that my dairy cooperative of 7 000 farmers is preparing well for 1 April 2015 and I have also advised dairy farmers to do likewise. Albert Deß  (PPE

Mr President, the subject of compensation payments that we are debating today is a very important one for our farmers in the areas concerned. I would like to point out here that the compensation payments are a success story in European agricultural policy. They have helped the management of the land to continue throughout these areas, where the biodiversity of the cultural landscape has been safeguarded and the jobs of people in these areas have been retained. This has meant that people in these areas continue to have prospects. I therefore find the way that the Commission as well as the Council have dealt with this sensitive matter even more incomprehensible. If we consider these eight biophysical criteria, we see that we will gain new inequities that are significantly worse than those under the current system, in which there are a few delimitation problems. We would have a system that would probably cause a great deal of anger. Details have leaked from Germany indicating that 2.8 million hectares would be removed and 1.2 million new hectares would be included in their place. When I speak to farmers from these areas, they are surprised that they should suddenly be in a Less-Favoured Area. From France, we hear that an area where farmers have the highest average income is to become a less-favoured area. This just does not add up. I would ask the Council whether it is prepared to work with Parliament in the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon so that we can draw up better proposals. Sometimes all I can say, with a certain amount of irony, is: I think as Parliament we need to make a few copies of the Treaty of Lisbon available to the Council and the Commission so that they finally catch on in all areas that this Treaty exists. It appears that many of them are not yet aware of this. Since the whole business really does already resemble a comedy show, as Mr Jahr put it, I would like to make another suggestion. We should declare the area in which the Commission and the Council meet to be a Less-Favoured Area, because they are withholding more than 66% of the information from us. Albert Deß,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to Ms Corazza Bildt and the other Member for the fact that this subject is on the agenda. Not everything is certain, but a hundred years ago we had almost exclusively local production, and products were brought to market in their local area. Today, the situation is quite different. I have here an interesting announcement from the German Federal Ministry of Agriculture, which has discussed precisely what the Commissioner was just saying, namely that it is already possible to entertain regional showcases and regional origin. According to the statement, the Federal Minister for the Economy Ilse Aigner is looking to launch regional labelling in Germany at a Federal/Länder
 summit in April. She says that she is now going to bring forward an initial plan for a new regional showcase for food packaging. The aim would be to put in place clear and transparent labelling for regional products. The labelling is to be voluntary initially, and will aim to make the origin of the product and the most important ingredients transparent. The results of a survey are also interesting. Seventy-nine per cent of consumers are prepared to pay more for regional foods, but only 17% feel reliably informed about the origin of regional foods. Herein lies the major problem, therefore. According to one survey, 83% of respondents in Germany already pay attention to which region a foodstuff comes from. There then follows an interesting statement: according to the Minister, there is no requirement either for a new national legal basis or for notification via the Commission in order to for such a regional showcase to be introduced. In other words, the Member States already have the latitude to act in this way. Nonetheless, the Commission needs to provide greater clarity in this area. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Thank you for your question, Mr Jahr. The reality, Commissioner, is that the Commission, too, needs to consider whether we do not need to lay down other criteria. I had an experience a few years ago, where I had to fight in the Commission in order to help a Bavarian slaughterhouse to survive. What did the Commission official over there have to say about it? He said, ‘Well, it’s no problem if it closes, there’s another slaughterhouse 60 kilometres away in Austria.’ We cannot promote regional products with that mindset. There therefore needs to be a broad-based change of attitude so that regional products, too, can be offered. In addition, we need the Commission to reconsider a few pieces of legislation that play a part in ensuring that this is no longer possible. Albert Deß,

 Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for the current debate in relation to the disease in animals caused by what is being referred to as the Schmallenberg virus. According to scientists, the virus has much in common with the Akabane virus, which has been familiar for some time now in animals from Africa to Japan and Australia. The Akabane virus is harmless to humans, so that it can be assumed that the Schmallenberg virus likewise poses no threat to humans. The virus is a major danger to animals, however, and can cause enormous economic damage. Commissioner, we need to do all we can to halt the spread of this disease and perhaps even to eradicate it. In order to be able to take effective steps, there is an urgent need for mandatory reporting throughout the European Union, something that has already been agreed in Germany at federal level. As we have already heard, the virus is transmitted by biting insects and it is very difficult to protect animals from such sources of infection. Effective protection is actually only possible through the use of an appropriate vaccine. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would call on the Commission to do all in its power to speed up the development of a corresponding vaccine, so that it becomes available as soon as possible. It is also important that the Commission should organise for this data to be recorded quickly, so that the relevant data is available and the necessary measures are implemented. It is also a matter for the Commission to achieve the lifting of the trade restrictions imposed by Russia on 20 March, as already called for. I have heard reports that, as well as Russia, Ukraine, Egypt, Algeria, Mexico and the US have already imposed initial trade restrictions. The faster we act, the sooner we can prevent the further spread of this disease and perhaps even eradicate it. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank Mr Nicholson for this report, which he wrote and on which he also led the negotiations in the trialogue. I would also like to thank all those who helped to bring this compromise about. Commissioner, the direction is the right one, but the impact in the Member States will vary enormously. In Germany, this dairy package will have hardly any impact. We already have producer associations under our Market Structure Act. Many farmers in Germany are organised into cooperatives, which means that they already jointly market their milk and dairy products. Contractual dealings in Germany are regulated by statute. In the private sector, we even already have these supply contracts. Unfortunately, this dairy package will not enable us to solve fundamental problems. This dairy package regulates dealings between producers and dairies. The biggest problem that I see, however, is in the relationship between the dairies and the retailers. This is not some kind of accusation against the parties involved. Nor, as landowners, are we responsible for this, but I ask you, Commissioner, to use your influence in the Commission to ensure that we regulate further issues on the basis of this dairy package, for example the issue of terms of payment for dairy products. It is not acceptable for farmers to deliver products to dairies – fresh milk expires after three days – and for the chain stores to only pay up after 60 or 80 days. Regulation is needed here. A second point is the listing fees, the discounts, that have to be granted here. We need binding net-net prices in the dairy sector so that transparency prevails in the sector. The supply volume rules are not binding, the length of contract with fixed prices between dairies and retail must be regulated. There is thus still much to do. However, my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), will certainly be voting in favour of this dairy package with a large majority. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Bové for his report and Ms Patrão Neves for the initiative for this motion for a resolution today. There are two developments that are worrying me. The first of these, Commissioner, is the growing gap between input and farm gate prices. The second is the situation right throughout the supply chain. Commissioner, I have just looked this up. On 27 July 1961, aged 14, I got my licence to drive a tractor, and my first job was to take grain to the brewery. At that time, 100 kg cost the equivalent of EUR 25. On my way home, I bought a newspaper, which cost me the equivalent of EUR 0.05. Today, cereal costs not EUR 25, but EUR 20, while the newspaper costs EUR 0.70 instead of EUR 0.05. If grain prices had followed the same trajectory as newspaper prices, consumers would now have to pay EUR 350 for 100 kg. You can see from these figures what Europe’s farmers are providing and what contribution they have made to giving our consumers cheap prices for food. What annoys me, and I am personally the chair of a farming cooperative, is the issue of terms of payment. Given the time constraints, I will limit myself to that. It has become a bad habit for the supermarket chains to saddle these farming cooperatives with ever longer payment terms. Once upon a time, it was 24 days. Now, even in Germany, it is often 60. In other words, if we deliver fresh milk, we make 30 deliveries before we get payment for the first one. Commissioner, there is an urgent need for action in this regard. We need to tackle these payment terms in the same way as we tackled roaming charges. That is the only way this situation will be rectified. I beg you to take action. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, Mr Sawicki, ladies and gentlemen, along with several Member States, you, Mr Cioloş, and you, Mr Sawicki, have spoken out in favour of continuing food aid for needy people. As we have heard, a political decision is required to ensure that this takes place. However, the responsibility for this important area lies primarily with the Member States. It is not acceptable that people in Europe do not have enough to eat. It is part of the social responsibility of the Member States to ensure that they do. In Germany there are laws which guarantee sufficient food for all the citizens of the country. The ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union has changed the framework of the current aid programme. Strict limits have been set on market purchases. The Court has determined that the current programme in its current form does not comply with the legal basis of the Treaties. I know that we need to find answers in order to guarantee that the millions of needy people in the EU are given help. However, I would like to stress once again that the socio-political responsibility lies with the Member States. Perhaps we should also consider whether it would be better to establish programmes in the Member States rather than one European programme. These would be cofinanced with social funding from Brussels, in order to guarantee the provision of food aid in all Member States. This would also safeguard European solidarity, which I am firmly committed to, and enable the programmes to be continued. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will certainly help to find solutions for the people who are affected. I was once travelling in Brazil with a group of people when some young Brazilians asked us if they could have the food that we had left on our plates. I was shocked that something like this could happen in a rich agricultural country. We must make sure that people in Europe have enough to eat. Albert Deß,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 50 years ago, in 1961, I began my training to be a farmer. Ever since then, I have been guided by the common European agricultural policy. It has become an important mainstay of the European unification process. Since the beginning of the CAP there have been fundamental changes to its tasks. The first task was to increase food production in order for us to be less dependent on food imports. Sometime later, Europe was in the position of having to deal with food surpluses. With an ever-changing situation, there were also more and more reforms. Today, we are debating the next reform, the new approach of the CAP after 2013. As rapporteur for the CAP reform towards 2020, I am pleased that we have achieved a cross-group compromise. Even if not all of the individual interests could be taken into account in a compromise, the report was adopted with a large majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. The clear vote is an unambiguous signal to the Commission of the form that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development sees the CAP taking towards 2020. I am certain, Commissioner, that the new approach of the CAP after 2013 will also bear the stamp of the European Parliament. The Treaty of Lisbon gives us that possibility. My thanks today go to my fellow Members for their involvement and support, and to the committee chair Mr De Castro, the coordinators and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and willingness to compromise. I would like to thank the staff of the committee secretariat, the political groups and in my own private office for their splendid cooperation. Turning to the report now: food safety and the security of supply for half a billion people remain the main goals of the common agricultural policy, not only in the EU, but also worldwide. The CAP is intended to be sustainable and competitive, to supply consumers with safe, high-quality food and also to promote renewable forms of energy. The two-pillar structure of the CAP is to remain so as to create certainty of planning for our farmers for this next period. The report clearly states – and here we support the Commissioner – that the agricultural budget should remain at the current level in the next financial period. I cannot understand President Barroso’s statement that massive cuts are to be made in the second pillar. I believe that there will be cross-group opposition to this. The simplification of the common agricultural policy remains an important task. That is a core demand of our compromise. We are also calling for a fair distribution among the Member States. That is also necessary in order to create a level playing field in terms of competition. We are seeking to move away from historical and individual references towards area-based premiums. The role of small farmers is to be recognised and, on the basis of subsidiarity, the Member States are to decide themselves how to support these small farmers. The importance of young farmers is mentioned. From my point of view, it was important to avoid introducing a new additional payment system that would lead to extra control and sanction systems for greening. Overall, we have found a compromise that many Members will be able to support tomorrow so that we can send out a clear signal as regards the new approach of this agricultural policy. A large majority of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will support this report. Albert Deß,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank everyone for this intense debate, and also for the support that I have been given here. Commissioner, we are all looking forward to your communication in October and then to good, positive cooperation. European agriculture is a positive factor. It feeds more than 500 million people, farms and looks after more than 170 million hectares of arable land and pasture, it provides many jobs in areas upstream and downstream, is an important buttress of rural areas and is already the most sustainable agricultural sector in the world. I therefore cannot understand why President Barroso has spoken of huge cuts in the second pillar. In so doing he is also jeopardising the EU2020 goals – in other words, his own goals. When 14 million farmers are feeding 500 million people, is it too much to ask that European agricultural policy be used to ensure that the 500 million people also provide properly for the 14 million farmers, so to speak? Here I should like to emphasise – as has been mentioned a couple of times today already – that there have been departures from my original report on some matters. I have been in the political game too long, and I know exactly why I drafted the report as I did. Had I written the report as it stands today, what would I have had to offer in the compromise negotiations? I allowed enough margin to ensure that everyone could be pacified, and a good result has been achieved today. My report therefore had a substantial buffer. The result I wanted to achieve was for us to send a signal as Parliament that we are addressing the important aspects that are necessary if European farmers are to have a good future. Once the legislative proposals are on the table, Commissioner, we will then work intensively to achieve a good outcome together. I can already assure you that you are likely to have greater support here in Parliament than some other commissioners would have. We are able to offer you that. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, back when I was a child, I received letters from what was then Rhodesia. Three of my grandfather’s sisters were Catholic nuns in the then Rhodesia and in South Africa. They never wrote of the people of Rhodesia having to go hungry. What we hear from this country today is simply intolerable. Rhodesia, and later Zimbabwe, were the bread basket of southern Africa. Mr Mugabe – a communist socialist dictator – has managed to turn this bread basket into a famine zone. I would like to thank all the fellow Members who have put this matter back on the agenda. It is intolerable that this dictator, Mr Mugabe, has been allowed to terrorise the people of Zimbabwe for so long. I believe that the key to ending this lies in southern Africa. I regret to say that for as long as South Africa fails to put this dictator in his place, he will continue to terrorise his people. Albert Deß,

 Madam President, Commissioner, thank you Commissioner for the factual presentation of this dioxin scandal in Germany. It makes me extremely angry, including in my capacity as a farmer, that again and again, we have to deal with scandals of this kind where the cause can seemingly be attributed to carelessness, but also to criminal activity. We can put as many laws and regulations in place as we like – in Europe, we have some of the most stringent laws on the production of food and we have the lowest limit values for ingredients that could harm the health of our consumers – but still we are not immune to such dangers. That is why it must also be a requirement – and the Member States are also responsible for this – that if the public prosecutor determines that criminal activity is involved, the magnitude of the penalty must be increased substantially. Such people must not get off with a fine – prison sentences are called for here. They must be put away so that they cannot cause such a disaster again. Commissioner, I am very pleased that you have acknowledged that the German authorities took the appropriate sequence of measures – that was also my impression in Germany. There was a certain amount of political commotion about the matter not being dealt with correctly. We all need to get together and, where necessary, supplement the strict provisions that we have in place. You mentioned one particular matter with regard to which you have our full support. I, too, am in favour – and I am also speaking on behalf of my group – of the introduction of the strict segregation of food production from the production of other products to prevent such mix ups from happening. You have our support, Commissioner, when it comes to improving our provisions and regulations further to enable us to better prevent such scandals in future. Albert Deß,

Madam President, Mr Cioloş, I am pleased that you are here today to answer questions. On 18 May, the European Parliament adopted with a large majority a resolution to simplify the common agricultural policy (CAP). Of course, it has not been possible for you to implement this resolution yet, but I would like to ask you, Mr Cioloş, to take into consideration all the demands made in this motion for a resolution when you begin restructuring agricultural policy. Unfortunately, I have to point out one fly in the ointment. I have just had a discussion with a group of farmers who were concerned that your proposals for the first pillar, Mr Cioloş, would not reduce the amount of red tape, but could instead lead to a huge increase in bureaucracy. The European Union cannot be held responsible for every piece of red tape, Mr Cioloş. A large proportion of the responsibility lies with the Member States. This is why I am asking you to ensure that we can work together on the forthcoming reform so that it is structured in such a way that it can be implemented with as little administrative and supervisory effort as possible. This will allow farmers to focus on their main job, in other words, producing food, rather than requiring them to check the current legislation to find out what they need to be aware of before they do anything out in their fields or their barns. In no other agricultural area in the world are farmers burdened with so many requirements and regulations as in the European Union. You are not yet responsible for this, Mr Cioloş. You have the chance to be the first Commissioner – before you eventually step down, and I do not know when that will happen – who can say that during his period of office, the amount of bureaucracy has been reduced rather than increased. As the rapporteur for agricultural reform, I would like to offer you the opportunity to work together with us to find a solution, so that this goal can be achieved. Albert Deß,

 Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, today’s motion for a resolution will help to set the European livestock sector on the right course. I would like to thank Mrs García for this initiative. The objective of the motion is not to cut Europe off from the rest of the world or to override the rules of the market. Its aim is to put in place fair market conditions for the European livestock industry, which will help to ensure food security for more than 500 million people in future. We must ensure that the European agricultural sector is not confronted with new and highly detailed production regulations on a daily basis and that farmers are not required to provide one certificate of competence after another, while maintaining high animal welfare and environmental standards. Rules of this kind apparently do not apply to imported agricultural products. Therefore, I am grateful to all the 534 Members of this House who voted in Strasbourg in favour of requiring agricultural imports to comply with European consumer protection, animal welfare and environmental protection standards in future. Mr Cioloş, Parliament is ready to give you its full support. These standards must be applied to imports and this is why my group welcomes and supports this motion. Albert Deß  (PPE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all those who worked on this report. Overall, their work has resulted in a good report. During the debate, it has become clear to me that the situation across Europe varies greatly. There are Member States in which a few large concerns dominate the market, and – thankfully – there are also Member States in which there are still many small retailers. There is just as much variation in the situation as regards food prices. There are Member States in which the price of food has risen substantially in recent times, and there are Member States – such as my home country of Germany – where there is merciless competition between enterprises and food prices are constantly being lowered, to the detriment of farmers. Our main concern is to call on the Commission and the Member States to review the situation and to take appropriate measures to allow farmers to add value in the food supply chain. The report also contains some very specific demands, however. I only have time to mention a few here, such as the call in paragraph 30 for a specified payment period. It is not acceptable that farmers, small businesses and cooperatives are providing short-term financing for major concerns. That is the job of the banks; it is not a job for farming cooperatives. Listing fees – as they are known – must also be investigated, Commissioner. We need a uniform regulation on this throughout Europe if we are to ensure competition. If we are to guarantee the food supply of 500 million people in the EU, then we must have fair competition for our farmers in Europe, as called for in the report. There is one more thing I would like to mention, which is that members of my group have asked for certain paragraphs to be voted on separately. As democrats, we have to accept that, but I am assuming that the vast majority of my group will vote in favour of most paragraphs so that we can achieve fair conditions for our farmers.

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, today sees an important debate on George Lyon’s report and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Lyon sincerely for the willingness to compromise that he showed in this document. We have managed to reach a good compromise that can be supported by many groups and I am hopeful that this compromise will be supported by a broad majority in the vote to take place at noon today. The common agricultural policy in Europe was and is one of the most important pillars of the European unification process. In this report we describe the effects of the common agricultural policy post 2013. The European agricultural sector produces high-quality food, protects vital rural areas and many jobs, maintains and promotes our cultural landscape and biodiversity and can make a contribution to conserving fossil fuels through the production of renewable raw materials and energy. To ensure that European agriculture can continue to perform these functions into the future, we must find a concept for the period post 2013 that will enable it to fulfil these many tasks. I welcome the fact that Commissioner Cioloş has clearly indicated that he wishes to see a continuation of a two-pillar system. My group will support this. The first pillar acts as a balance to the constraints under which European agriculture operates in relation to other agricultural regions in the world, while the second pillar involves the creation of a catalogue of measures to enable the 27 Member States to ensure that agriculture receives additional aid to enable it to fulfil its functions. The vast majority of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will vote in favour. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, clearly the Mercosur countries are important trading partners for us. However, Commissioner, this trade with the Mercosur countries should not be allowed to become a one-way street. The frequent claims made in public that Europe is closing itself off in the agricultural markets are quite wrong. We purchase over 90% of African agricultural exports and 45% of Central and South American agricultural exports. Europe is certainly not closed off to external trade. What I would criticise, Commissioner, is the information policy pursued. It has not been good. As an agricultural policymaker, I first learned that these negotiations had begun when I opened the newspapers. In future we should not have to rely on the press for our information. I urge you to inform the agricultural sector represented here in Parliament about the progress of negotiations. Another point I would criticise is the fact that the objective here is free trade that is not based on standards. How can it be that we demand high standards of consumer protection, animal protection and environmental protection in Europe, but do not require the same standards from imports? Let me offer just one example in this regard. Last year, Parliament passed the most stringent plant protection product legislation in the world. Many active ingredients are prohibited in Europe. Commissioner, we cannot have a situation in the future where food is supplied to Europe from countries in which active ingredients are used that are prohibited in Europe for reasons of consumer protection. Consumer protection is inviolable and we would do well to remember this in negotiations. Then we have nothing to fear from our competitors, and we European farmers will stand our ground against this competition. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased that the report on specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union has been so amicably discussed in the House. In the last electoral term, I was the shadow rapporteur for reform of the sugar market. At that time, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development visited the island of Réunion where I visited a small agricultural holding that grows sugar cane. Without our support, this small agricultural holding could not stay in existence. As someone from the continental mainland, I also observed that these farmers in the outermost regions of the Union do face a special set of circumstances. It is necessary for us to ensure, through certain rules on exceptions, that we offer these farmers in all these regions that are in the European Union future prospects and ensure that they are able to guarantee food security – at least for the most part – in these areas. It is up to us all to help ensure that agriculture – including through these rules on exceptions – has future prospects and that the security of supply for the local population is safeguarded. The way the report has now been drawn up provides good conditions for achieving these goals. My heartfelt thanks go to all those who have been involved. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, I have voted against the motion for a resolution, because in my opinion, it is lacking some important data. Recently, there has been an increasing number of reports of climate scientists having faked data. It is important for us to discuss this and make our opinions known. In order to ensure that there is no misunderstanding, I would like to explain that I have been committed for many years to reducing our use of fossil fuels and, therefore, our impact on the environment. However, I cannot understand the scaremongering that has been associated with the phrase ‘climate change’. I have experienced a great deal in my long career as a politician. In the early 1980s, people said that there would be no trees left in Germany by 2000, but Germany is greener than it has ever been. It is true that the climate is changing, but this has been happening throughout history and will continue to do so in future. For this reason, I have voted against this motion for a resolution.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, last year, and this year, too, dairy farmers made their concerns known very loudly, including in Brussels. The impression you get from the media is that it is only the dairy farmers that are in a difficult situation. The fact is that other farming sectors are also affected by this. In contrast to our dairy farmers, the pig producers, pig fatteners, poultry farmers, fruit and vegetable growers, wine growers and even cereal farmers are used to there being good and bad years and therefore do not make their voices heard so loudly. Nevertheless, I think that it is good for us to highlight the situation of these farmers today, too. Commissioner, you said that the financial and economic crisis has affected the whole of the agricultural sector and that we ought to consider how we can respond to this. When talking with the farmers affected on the ground, I hear the same things again and again: by and large, they say they are coping with the markets, apart from situations where it is extremely difficult, like it was last year and is this year for the dairy farmers and others. However, what the farmers do not understand is that we in Europe are burdening them with ever more red tape. They say that they want to work their land and feed and care for their animals rather than spend the whole day keeping books and records about what they are doing. For centuries, our farmers have produced food without keeping vast quantities of records. The yields on the land have increased, the performance of the animals has improved and today, we inundate our farmers with red tape. I have recently read that the agricultural ministers are discussing a reduction in red tape. Our farmers hardly dare believe this anymore. I hope that we can finally make some progress on this and allow our farmers to do what they do best, in other words, produce food – healthy food for half a billion people. We should support them in so doing and ensure that they are able to achieve this in future. Albert Deß,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, Commissioner, it is important for us in the European Parliament to discuss the subject of hunger in the world. We cannot simply sit silently by while the number of people suffering from hunger, which includes many children, increases. I was first elected to a parliament 20 years ago and I can still remember well how international organisations such as the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, the United Nations itself and the World Trade Organisation stated their intention of halving hunger in the world within the next 20 years. What has happened since then? Hunger has not been halved, it has increased. More than 1 billion people suffer from hunger every day. The opposite of what these organisations intended has occurred. There is a wide range of different causes for this. There are countries such as Zimbabwe where an incompetent government has transformed the bread basket of Africa into a famine region. A communist president has brought this rich country to a position where people are suffering from hunger and we say nothing. However, we share the responsibility for this. We spend weeks, if not years, talking about the climate in one hundred years’ time. The people who are suffering from hunger today and tomorrow are not interested in the climate in one hundred years. They want something to eat tomorrow, but we have no answers to their problems. Without wanting to neglect the issues of the future, it is a question of simple humanity to concern ourselves with people who are suffering from hunger today. Mr de Gucht, when we say that we intend to halve hunger by 2050, I find this almost insulting. As a world community, it must be possible for us to reduce the number of people who do not have enough to eat much more quickly. We can transport weapons to every corner of the world, but apparently we are not able to do this with food. This is a failure of the world community, which I would like to denounce. We must find other answers than the ones which we have come up with today. Albert Deß  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, I am grateful to Mrs Herranz García for bringing up this topic today in Parliament. This is a discussion which is fundamental to food policy. I am not interested in shaming Brazil or other countries. The basic question is this: Do we need these strict regulations for European agricultural production in the interests of consumer safety? If the answer is ‘yes’, then this means that consumer protection is regarded as a coherent whole. If the regulations are needed, then the same rules must apply to imports as to our own farmers. The Commission must not allow imports from countries which do not fulfil these requirements. Cattle farmers in Europe must not be punished because one cow in their herd has an ear tag missing, when imports are allowed from cattle herds which do not have a single ear tag. This is not acceptable. If traceability is so important for consumer protection, then it must also apply to imports. If we cannot ensure that this is the case, then it is unfair to our farmers to demand it of them. I have the impression that those people in the Commission who are responsible for imports are applying double standards. As already discussed, I am not interested in partitioning off Europe. I would like to see fair competition for our farmers in Europe so that we can continue to guarantee the food supply of half-a-billion people in future. I can assure you of one thing, Commissioner, and you can pass this on to your successor, Parliament will continue to touch on this sore point. We will not give up until equal competitive conditions have been established. We have good arguments that we can bring up repeatedly to ensure that food security is guaranteed in Europe in future. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the request to use the urgent procedure put forward by the Commission is certainly not perfect. I can partially agree with what the previous speaker said. However, to not allow this request to use the urgent procedure now would send completely the wrong signals to the dairy farmers, who are expecting at least initial responses. That is why I support this request to use the urgent procedure. In the course of this procedure, we will have the opportunity to improve the motion by means of amendments and, as Mr Häusling suggested, to cede powers. It is absolutely the case that there are possibilities to put a time limit on these powers so that we only give the Commission a power for two years before we then decide on the matter again. I would therefore ask for your support in order to put this request for use of the urgent procedure on the agenda. (Applause) Albert Deß,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome the fact that this request to use the urgent procedure was passed here in Parliament today by a large majority. In this way, we have sent a signal to our dairy farmers and have not shied away from the responsibility. In contrast to a minority of my fellow Members from other groups, we see, in this request to use the urgent procedure, an additional tool to get help to dairy farmers at a difficult time. It is certainly true that this request from the Commission did come very late in the day and that it is less than what is possible. That said, it is always better than doing nothing at all. The views within my own group about the proposed buy-back programme also diverge widely. The programme would have to be obligatory for it to have any impact at all. Yet I see no majority for that in this Parliament or in the Council. Furthermore, such a programme would not be acceptable to some of the Member States as it would be tantamount to a cutting back of the balancing out arrangement and also of the quotas. The indication that quotas are to be raised for priority groups is a decision that is already the law in force. The inclusion of milk and milk products in Article 186 for immediate measures in the event of market disturbances is to be welcomed. Nonetheless, I will be tabling an amendment to the effect that this measure should be restricted to two years. If it proves its worth, we will then agree to an extension. Finally, I would like to say thank you for the EUR 280 million. Commissioner, you have indeed largely accommodated Parliament. I know that you do not have any more money available to you. I ask that the – possibly amended – motion for a resolution be approved on Thursday. Albert Deß,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is, of course, extremely difficult to summarise this problem in two minutes, but I will try to do it in the style of bullet points. The dairy sector is in trouble. Many dairy farmers are seeing their very existence under threat. The main reason for this is a huge drop in milk product sales. The Commission really should have acted more swiftly in this regard. I would also have preferred to see stronger sales promotion measures instead of a greater amount of intervention, such as butter fat being used once again in the ice cream industry. Last year, when the price of butter reached more than EUR 4 for a short time, a large proportion of the ice cream industry stopped processing butter fat. I know the figures for Germany, which show that around 100 000 tonnes is no longer being processed by the food industry, which corresponds to a million tonnes of milk. We must try to stimulate sales once again, in order to clear these quantities from the market. I would like to thank the groups that have helped in drawing up our joint motion for a resolution. Unfortunately, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance did not participate in this discussion. Commissioner, as a short-term measure we are calling for an increase in the de minimis subsidies in an additional motion which is being tabled with 40 signatures, because this would be an opportunity to help the smaller dairy farmers in particular. It would also make sense to introduce an early retirement regulation. I know a lot of farmers who are 58 years old and who would like to stop working soon. An appropriate regulation would be needed for this. Commissioner, I would like to thank you sincerely for your work. I would ask you to put in place appropriate regulations to improve the situation of our dairy farmers. Perhaps you will still have the chance to remedy this situation in the near future.

 I abstained in today’s vote on the ACTA agreement, because I believe that we should wait for the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union on ACTA. The intention is for the Court to carry out a definitive examination of whether the agreement changes existing European law. I have read the agreement myself and I believe that this is not the case. In 2010, the EU seized 103 million products at its external borders that were most probably counterfeit products. For the first time the estimated value of the equivalent genuine products was also quoted, this being more than EUR 1 billion. In view of these incredible figures, I believe that we urgently need to work even more intensively to combat product piracy in order to safeguard the competitiveness of our European industry. A global agreement on the protection of intellectual property is therefore essential. Angelika Niebler,

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I assume that each of you here in plenary has a smartphone and that you use them all the time, wherever you are – whether you are out and about at home, in your own country, or in Europe, whether you are on holiday or on business. We here in Parliament are by no means exceptional; our citizens are also permanently mobile and on the move in Europe. Our young people, in particular, are constantly online nowadays. That is why I am particularly pleased that tomorrow, we will be able to adopt the Roaming III Regulation, as it is known, which will enter into force on 1 July 2012. In other words, just in time for the holiday season, we will be able to give our citizens the benefit of lower tariffs when they use smartphones in Europe. The future belongs to mobile devices. These days, everyone is mobile 24 hours a day. In recent years, there has been a huge increase in data transfer via smartphones in particular, and we will see further huge increases in the years ahead. In contrast, the costs of using a mobile phone abroad are still extremely high; indeed, they have hardly come down at all. That is unacceptable. The charges must reflect reality. We cannot allow people using smartphones at home or in another European country to be charged many times what they have to pay at home for making calls, sending or receiving texts or downloading data. I can tell you that I am with a German provider, and at the beginning of this week, my provider informed me that I will have to pay EUR 8.20 if I download one megabyte of data here in Brussels. That is a complete rip-off, and we cannot allow it to continue. What, then, will the new Roaming Regulation do? Its main aim is reduced charges for all our citizens. We hope to achieve this by creating greater competition in the roaming market in future. We are introducing maximum charges, and one particularly new element is a maximum retail charge for data transfer. The first maximum retail charge will take effect on 1 July 2012. In future, one megabyte will cost no more than EUR 0.70. The charges will be lowered further from 1 July 2013, when a maximum retail charge of EUR 0.45 per megabyte will come into force. The third price reduction will take effect on 1 July 2014, when the maximum charge will become EUR 0.20 per megabyte. We had to fight hard for these maximum retail charges in tough negotiations with the Council. I would like to extend my great thanks to my shadow rapporteurs and, in particular, to the rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, Robert Goebbels. Had we not fought so hard for better charges, then we would not be today where we hope to be after 1 July. The market will also be opened up to new providers without a network of their own, in what is known as an open access solution. Moreover, from 1 July 2014, consumers will be able to choose roaming services from providers other than their national provider. This proposed solution is known as unbundling and, in future, European customers will also be able to use local services when travelling abroad – known as local break-out – by being able to choose the best offer from the various local operators, as is already the case for WLan access. We have also introduced consumer protection rules. In future, these will apply not just within Europe, but also outside the European Union. The obligation to send a warning when users reach a certain tariff level, a certain level of charges, will also apply abroad. Other consumer protection rules have also been introduced in order to prevent involuntary roaming. All in all, I can say that today is a good day for our citizens of Europe. I am pleased that from 1 July, charges will be reasonable, even for roaming. (Applause) Angelika Niebler,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Ms Kroes, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank everyone very much for the many appreciative comments. I am very pleased, because I have never before received so much praise in Parliament. However, I would also like to express my gratitude and, most importantly, to return the thanks of all the Members of this Parliament who have given me such strong support during the debates. Of course, I would like to thank the Danish Presidency and the Commission once again for their excellent cooperation. It is true that we have a European internal market and a Single Euro Payments Area. I believe that our objective must be to establish a single European communication area, as many Members have already said in the course of this debate. Creating a roaming-free area in Europe must be our ultimate goal. I very much hope that we will be able to achieve this in the near future. I also hope, Ms Kroes, that we do not need a Roaming IV Regulation, as Mr Rübig has suggested. I hope, as a result of the structural measures and the competition which will now develop, that one provider will make a bold move and stop charging for roaming altogether. I hope that this will happen before the revision and before you submit a report here in 2016. I hope that the competitive market functions in such a way that the subject of roaming finally becomes a thing of the past. I would like to pass on my warm thanks. I am looking forward to the vote tomorrow and I hope that Parliament will give the report substantial support. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, who also so successfully put across Parliament’s position in the negotiations with the Council. ‘Spectrum Gunnar’, you have my thanks! More and more European citizens make use of mobile Internet services, and the trend is upwards. I have a couple more figures to highlight this. In 2010 alone, average monthly smartphone usage doubled to 79 MB from 35 MB the previous year. Similarly, in 2010 3 million new tablets – such as the iPad – were newly connected to the mobile network. In future, too, even greater data traffic is anticipated. Experts predict that mobile data traffic will increase by a factor of 26 between 2010 and 2015, and in 2015 some 788 million people will use the Internet exclusively from mobile devices. Against this backdrop, the first European radio spectrum policy programme, which we will be deciding on tomorrow, therefore has a particular role to play. Our goal is clear – more frequencies need to be made available for wireless broadband networks in future than has been the case so far. The flood of data was threatening to block up the transmission capacities that we have hitherto had available. More frequencies will mean that we can continue to use our mobile Internet services without interruption in future. If we adopt the radio spectrum policy programme tomorrow with a broad majority, we will have done something positive for our citizens in Europe. As you all know, I am currently also fighting on another front, as rapporteur for the new Roaming Regulation, to bring about better conditions for mobile Internet use. I believe that surfing the net when abroad must become much cheaper. Commissioner, you have already brought forward a bold proposal in this regard. We also aim to be somewhat bolder in Parliament, as we want to achieve something for our European consumers. If the Roaming Dossier – as is my hope – can be wrapped up in the first half of this year I would be very pleased if I earned the nickname ‘Roaming Angelika’. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure we all agree that our objective is an open, fair Internet. That has already been mentioned by many fellow Members. We need this not only for our citizens, for users of the network and for the economy – the Commission mentioned this – but we also need it for our policies and for democratisation processes. I need only remind you of the Arab Spring. We would not have been able to find out about many of the developments in the North African states and in the Middle East if it had not been for the Internet. How will we achieve this? I would like to refer to what Mr van Nistelrooij said. The Netherlands has gone ahead with a regulation on net neutrality. That is – please forgive me, Mr van Nistelrooij – the wrong approach to take. I think it is important for us to take a genuine European approach here, for us not to propose 27 separate regulations in this regard, but at least in Europe to seek to take a unified, harmonised approach to this issue. Therefore, I would, above all, ask the Commission, after careful analysis of the facts and with the involvement of BEREC and the national regulators, to present a proposal as quickly as possible. In one sub-area – roaming – we are currently having this debate. Structural changes are already underway in this area in connection with switching operators. I believe that this is the right course to take. Perhaps we do not need any horizontal regulation of net neutrality at all. Roaming provides a good example here. I would like to make one final point. As I see it, the most important thing for our citizens at home is that there should be no misleading advertising in respect of fast transmission rates. Many providers entice customers with offers that promise extremely fast data transmission speeds. However, these offers can only be exploited at three o’clock on the morning. At other times, the transmission rates do not reach anywhere near the speeds frequently promised in the advertisements. I would be grateful – to you, too, Ms Gaj – if you could check once again with BEREC and get back to us as to whether the subject of ‘no misleading advertising in respect of fast transmission rates’ is also being addressed.

 Firstly, I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, who has succeeded over months of tough negotiations in drafting a report on the subject of women and business leadership which, to a large extent, is very balanced and deserves our support. I would like to explain briefly why I voted against paragraph 1 and paragraph 16b. The figures on the proportion of women in management positions are shameful. Therefore, I am fully convinced that we finally need to take targeted measures to bring about a significant increase in this proportion. However, I feel that the calls made in paragraph 1 and paragraph 16b go too far. I do not believe that we should intervene in the operational management of businesses or set quotas even for the board of directors. Therefore, we should first of all call on companies to take voluntary measures. In particular, I think that 2012 is far too early for the introduction of legislative provisions and quotas. However, in order to send out a clear political signal that something needs to be done urgently and, at the same time, to support the efforts made by Mrs Kroes, I have voted in favour of the resolution as a whole. Angelika Niebler  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we definitely need more women in the top executive suites of companies throughout the European Union. You all know the statistics. Only one in ten board members in the European Union are women; 97% of board members are men. I think that we all agree that action is urgently needed. I should like to thank the Commissioner. Commissioner, it was you who took the bold step in March and called for action. You called on companies to take voluntary action. If they do not, you will table a legislative proposal, a legal basis, in March 2012. Thank you so much. The figures that we have seen in the meantime illustrate that something has already been done. If you had not been so bold, Mrs Reding, we would not have made these small steps. I should also like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, for her excellent draft. I agree with many of the statements in this draft. I shall support the draft, even though I take a different view of the quota as it now stands in the report. I take the view that, if self-regulation does nothing to help, a statutory quota is needed in order to put pressure on companies. However, I also take the view that we should start by introducing this quota for the supervisory structures of large companies, not for the operational side of businesses. I shall not therefore support the proposal in paragraph 16(b); however, I shall vote in favour of the report, because it says the right things. How women stand on the quota is a question of their own self-image. I would have no problem in using a quota to open the door. Whether or not I am good at my job is something that I still have to prove, regardless of how I get there. In that respect, a quota helps, but it is no substitute for performance. No woman has a problem with a door being held open. You have to walk through and prove yourself. Women in the European Union also need to be given an opportunity to walk through. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Madam President, I would like to ask you, Mrs Harms, why you have not thanked Mr Oettinger. Why did you not say thank you? I think the accusations that you have made against him here are outrageous. Mr Oettinger was the only person who made the most of the opportunity to bring together everyone involved immediately after Fukushima and to insist that we carry out stress tests at a European level, regardless of the responsibilities. Now we have a result that goes far beyond the tests carried out over the last 15 or 20 years, with European involvement and with peer reviews by teams that have been put together at a European level. I believe it is unfair for you to continue following your own green policy without taking any responsibility. Angelika Niebler,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mrs Reding, ladies and gentlemen, let me perhaps introduce the topic with a few examples. Greece and other states are heavily in debt, although billions from the structural funds have been poured into these countries for many years. How can we improve the use of these resources and how can the utilisation of these resources be better controlled? My second example relates to Eurobonds. What effect do they have on the European budget? Thirdly, if we were to introduce a financial transaction tax in Europe, what would the consequences be? For all these questions, Parliament demands in its reports that a regulatory impact assessment be carried out. After all, we need facts in order to be able to take politically sound decisions. That is what my report on improving the guarantee of independent impact assessments is all about. This is not a new issue. It has occupied us, together with other issues concerning the improvement of legislation, for over ten years. However, despite all the efforts of the Commission to improve its impact assessment as well as those that we have made in this regard in the European Parliament, the quality of the impact assessment is still in need of improvement. My report puts forward proposals for how, with regard to the European Commission and the impact assessments that it carries out, as well as with regard to Parliament’s impact assessment studies, we can succeed in bringing about this improvement. In terms of its content, the report is divided into four sections. Firstly, there are general requirements for impact assessments at European level. The second section contains proposals directed at the European Commission and it lists potential areas where improvements can be made. In the third section, I discuss how we in the European Parliament can better optimise the regulatory impact assessment as an instrument. In the last section, I then propose that we in Parliament create an autonomous impact assessment structure. With regard to the general requirements for impact assessments at European level, it is important to note that we need to move away from pure cost analysis towards an examination of the economic, social and health-related impact of legislation at European level. Secondly, I think it is important that we carry out an SME test in connection with all regulatory impact assessments and also examine the effect on industrial competitiveness in Europe. Thirdly, in this report, we propose the early publication by the Commission of road maps of proposed legislation in order to give Parliament and the stakeholders the opportunity to express their opinions during the consultation period. With regard to the European Commission, we call, in particular, for the members of the Impact Assessment Board that was set up a while ago in the Commission to be independent and for the parliamentary committees to be involved in the work at an early stage. With regard to Parliament, we believe it is important for us actually to utilise the regulatory impact assessment as an instrument. Up to now, a few committees have been using it, but I think we need to make much more extensive use of this instrument in our discussions in Parliament. If we succeed in developing Parliament’s own resources and establishing an autonomous structure under the leadership of Members of this House in order to develop a method that allows us to carry out professional regulatory impact assessments within the European Parliament, then I believe we will have achieved a great deal with this report. I hope it will receive your support tomorrow in the vote. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Mr President, I apologise for taking the floor once again, but I believe that some confusion has arisen, because my fellow Members are not currently discussing my report, but the report on social responsibility, which will be debated later. Perhaps we could first finish the debate on the subject of the impact assessment – I believe Mr Baldassarre had asked to speak on the subject of my report – and then we can move on to the next report. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe 2020 strategy – to be honest, I do not feel like discussing the Europe 2020 strategy at all. Ten years ago, we adopted a strategy, the Lisbon Strategy. When you now look back at this past decade, the results are limited, if I may put it in those modest terms. I think that we should currently be focusing on what really matters to people at home in our Member States, rather than making the same mistake again. They are wondering whether we will be able to ensure the stability of our currency. Will there be inflation? What lessons do we need to learn from the developments over the last two years, from the financial and economic crisis, and now from the currency crisis? Are we really taking to task the players in the financial markets who have contributed to the crisis? I would emphatically call on the Commission, first and foremost, to take steps to ensure rapid financial market regulation and progress in Europe in order to prevent, as has been the case in recent years, money being sent around the globe five times in the same day and many people making a profit on this while losses are being nationalised. I would ask the Commission to demand that Member States exercise strict budgetary discipline and implement appropriate rules. I would also ask for the earliest possible tightening of the Stability and Growth Pact. This is where we should be focusing our efforts. I urge the Commission to take requisite measures, but not as before, off its own bat or by discussing them thoroughly with Member States. Instead, it should finally take Parliament seriously as an equal legislator alongside the 27 Members States. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, over recent months, the conditions for the people, as well as the overall political and economic situation, have dramatically deteriorated in Yemen. We Europeans must therefore do everything we can to finally stabilise the country. High Representative, might I ask you to please prevent Yemen from becoming a second Afghanistan. We must do everything in our power to fight international terrorism. We will only be able to achieve that, however, if we also support a peace process in Yemen. We need to achieve peace in the region and we need to support the peace efforts of the government there. The Yemeni Government could also be reminded, once again, that it needs to ensure that there is no discrimination in Yemen – only then can there be peace. Peace requires democratic structures that uphold the rights of minorities. That is our European path, and it may differ from other paths. I ask you, in your new role, to spare no efforts to walk this European path with us. Without political stability, Yemen has no chance. With political stability, the local economy can recover, then an economy can be built up and people can be given future prospects. I ask you to work hard for this. I also ask you to make your influence count to ensure that the auxiliary troops there can provide humanitarian assistance. There are over 130 000 refugees from Somalia in Yemen. The situation on the ground is dreadful. I put all my hopes on you, Baroness Ashton, in the expectation that you will use your influence here. Please also stand up for the six hostages, for the European citizens – one Briton and five Germans – who are being held as hostages in Yemen. Maybe you can also help to get them freed. Many thanks.

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you will all be familiar with Google, the internet search engine. You will probably also know about the new Google Books Project, which everyone has been discussing over the last few months. The aim of the project is to scan in books from libraries and make them available over the internet, so that readers have quick and easy access to a large number of works on the web. From the perspective of readers and internet users, this is a wonderful idea. However, what does it mean for authors, creative people, artists and publishers? What part will they play in the publication of their work on the web? We must look closely at these questions over the next few months. You may already be aware that publishers and authors in the US have initiated legal proceedings against Google with regard to the scanning and publication of works on the web. As far as I know, the legal dispute has been resolved and the parties have settled out of court. However, the questions remain unanswered and they relate not only to the situation with Google, because there are certain to be similar cases in future. We must deal with these questions as quickly as possible. Does copyright need to be adapted in the digital age? Do we need to change existing structures? In this respect, I am thinking particularly of the role of the collecting societies, which we have often discussed in Parliament. Are new monopolies being created on the web? How should we react to this? How will this change the structures in our countries, for example, with regard to the bookshops in the regions? What are the opposing interests in this case and how can we find a suitable balance between them? Authors and publishers want to receive a financial reward for their work. This also applies, of course, when their works are made available on the internet. Libraries want to put their archives on the web without having to sign a licence agreement with every copyright holder first. The interests of consumers are clear. They would very much like to have quick and easy access to the content on the web. We have not yet reached the point of being able to discuss possible solutions, but we need to ask ourselves a lot of questions and that is the purpose of the written question submitted to the Commission by the Committee on Legal Affairs. Do we need to make distinctions in order to resolve the copyright issues, for example, with regard to content? If so, what distinctions should be made? The Commission seems to be moving in this direction, as it is first of all focusing on the situation of the library stocks. Should there be a process of mass digitisation in future, or is our existing licensing system sufficient to resolve the problem? How can copyright clearance be simplified in the internet age? As you know, copyright is primarily a national right and in this respect, we must once again ask ourselves: is this still an up-to-date approach? How should we deal with orphan works in future, in other words, books whose copyright holder cannot be identified or located? Should we perhaps distinguish between literary works and scientific or academic works? For example, the authors of novels earn their living from the publication of their books, but when scientists make their papers available on the web, they are primarily interested in making a name for themselves in their field of research and are less reliant on the money that their work earns. There are numerous questions that we need to ask ourselves and I am pleased to be able to discuss them with you. I would like to consider one last important point and that is once again the subject of collecting societies. Look at how easy it is nowadays to download music from the internet. You simply go to iTunes and buy songs for 20, 30, 40 or 50 cents. What are the implications for the collecting societies? Do we still need them? I would be pleased if the Commission could once again give us an idea of what the current situation is. In Parliament, we have been asking the Commission for years to take a look at the collecting societies. To put it rather imprecisely, these are also monopolistic bodies, which have been established over a period of decades. I am interested to know what the Commission is planning. My final point is that if you take a platform like Google, which makes everything freely available, this will result in a monopoly being created on the web. We need to consider how the situation should be handled in order to ensure that we do not end up with just one supplier, who then decides on the conditions for access to content on the web. I am looking forward to a debate with you over the next few weeks and months and I will be interested to hear the Commission’s response to the first question from the Committee on Legal Affairs. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I have three points to make. The first is that the car industry is a key industry for Europe and – this has already been said – when you include all the upstream and downstream businesses and the whole supply industry, 12 million jobs depend on it. I just want to emphasise this one more time as Mr Chatzimarkakis is sitting there in front of me, having just said that the German Government’s efforts were electioneering bluster. I can only refute this definitively. It is a mocking affront to the workers employed in this sector across numerous European countries who have to fear for their jobs day in and day out. Secondly, rescuing Opel is in the common interests of Europe as a whole. I think it is particularly important to stress this, irrespective of the debate today. There are sites in the UK, Belgium, Poland, Spain, Germany and other European countries. If Opel is rescued by the fact that there is an investor, namely Magna, that there are bridging loans, for which the German Government fought, it is not only in Germany’s interests but those of Europe as a whole. We must all take steps to retain jobs in our home countries. I am pleased. Where would we be today if we had not taken steps to bring about the trusteeship solution? There would not be any need for further debate today in that case, as the debate would have been done and dusted in any case when General Motors drew GM Europe along with it into the mess surrounding its insolvency. My third point is that there are strict rules for State aid. I am confident that the Commission will examine this matter in a proper manner doing justice to the interests involved. The crucial question will be whether Opel Europe can be profitable again in the medium term. I am confident that the solution that has now been produced and on which Magna, too, is working, and which involves many other European States, can be implemented. I ask the Commission to also provide the relevant authorisation and I would like to conclude by re-stating that, in this case, we have achieved something positive for the car industry in Europe as a whole! Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Ms McAvan, warmly for her excellent work once again. Good pharmacovigilance protects the citizens of Europe. At the same time, we are also bolstering informed patients. It was therefore very important to close the safety loopholes exposed and actually opened up by the Mediator case as soon as possible. From now on, a company that removes a medicinal product from the market must state the reasons why it is doing so. The other Member States will also be informed via the European Medicines Agency – something that is irremissible for the protection of patients in Europe’s internal market, too. There is one point that is particularly close to my heart, which is the better readability of package inserts. Many patients really do complain about the complexity of package inserts. They say they are too difficult, too hard to understand, too unreadable, too confusing. This is a subject that the older elements of the population in particular bring up, although it is not only them. Some patients are even so scared by the side effects when trying to find important information that, in the end, they do not even take the medicine. Together with Mr Liese, I therefore advocated the idea that the package insert should be made more readable for patients and that a drug facts box containing the most important information, including the side effects, should be included on the package insert, written in plain language and given graphic emphasis. I am very pleased about the result obtained from the negotiations, and about the fact that the Commission, Commissioner Dalli, has also promised to produce a report on better readability. I hope that the Commission will keep its promise and also that it does so as soon as possible. I would be interested to hear – and I am happy to take the opportunity presented by the presence of Commissioner Dalli with us here today – whether there are already specific ideas in this regard at this point. I would be really interested to hear the answer to that question. I would like to offer my thanks to the Commission for having tackled this issue, as it really does represent a major step towards patient friendliness if we can improve the package insert and make it more readable.

 I have a question for Ms Girling. She has just stated that the rules for gluten intolerance will not be of any further help. I believe that it is very important to protect these people because intolerance sufferers require this strict diet. If we fail to include them in the high protection standards of this regulation, instead depending solely on food labelling, then the necessary level of protection is not assured. It is for this reason that I strongly support this resolution and would like to ask Ms Girling why she believes this is not the case. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
).  
– (DE) 
Mr President, the average consumer has complete freedom to choose products in the supermarket and to consume them afterwards. The provisions of the Food Labelling Regulation are sufficient for this. Certain groups, such as infants and small children, require particular protection when it comes to composition and labelling, however. As a mother of a one-year-old daughter who breast-fed her child for seven months, I am very pleased that milk replacement products can no longer be advertised with euphemistic images suggesting that these products might even be better than breast milk. I also welcome the fact that follow-on milk is once again to be examined, as I also decided against using this milk. It tastes sweet and actually encourages the child to prefer such products, so that in the future it will not drink conventional milk. People who suffer from gluten intolerance need special foods if they are to avoid serious complications, such as bowel cancer. It is for this reason that I also believe it important to maintain a high standard of protection here. This is only possible by incorporating gluten intolerance in the regulation. This includes, for example, provisions requiring that the foods for these patients should provide the same amount of vitamins and minerals as the foods they replace. It is vital that this protection standard is maintained. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
),

 I can only agree that we should put an end to the wastage of food. The figures are alarming: 60% of food waste in European households could be avoided. The Commission has come to the conclusion that a fifth of the food is thrown away because ‘best before’ dates are not used correctly. I can therefore only support the call for 2013 to be declared the European Year against Food Waste, with information and educational initiatives. We need citizens to be more aware, right from childhood onwards. We need to explain to our citizens what the ‘best before’ date means. The ‘best before’ date is not an expiry date. Consumers should use it only as a guide. The ‘use by’ date for perishable goods is different. These products should not be consumed after such a date. We all have a responsibility to prevent food waste across Europe and to create greater understanding. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
),

 In the European Parliament, we have been fighting for safe, high-quality foodstuffs for many years. The text that we have voted on today provides anything but this, as it waters down the current standards for the quality of fruit juices in Europe. Therefore, I was unable to vote in favour of the compromise package today. However, I would also like to express my criticism of the negotiation process. It is unacceptable for the opinion of the lead committee to be disregarded to a large extent in the compromise package. The European Parliament fought long and hard to be given equal legislative powers. We must also exercise this responsibility in the negotiations for the good of the citizens of Europe. In the interests of these citizens, I would have liked the result of the vote to have been different today. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, today’s vote in the European Parliament aimed at combating Internet pornography is pioneering the protection of our children. We will have more protection for the victims and better prevention. The measures adopted will enable better prevention of all abuse of children, in particular the growing phenomenon of child pornography on the Internet. National laws are not enough to combat child Internet pornography. Here the European Union offers us an opportunity to stamp out these grievous activities on a Europe-wide basis. As a young mother, it is a particular concern and very important for me that pornographic material involving children should be taken down off the Internet immediately. I therefore welcome the decision to prescribe the deletion of such material as the ideal solution. The new regulations also provide a greater level of protection for the victims throughout Europe through higher, more stringent penalties for the perpetrators. I fully support the comprehensive approach taken by the directive. The legal framework is every bit as important as information and prevention measures. This law puts us on the right path for protecting the youngest members of our society. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
),  
in writing.

 I would like to thank Mrs Sommer, the rapporteur, for her excellent work over the last four years. Today’s vote in the European Parliament is groundbreaking. It brings more clarity and openness for consumers. The model I have in mind is that of responsible consumers who are aware of what they are buying. However, that will only be the case when they also know what a product contains. Today’s decision will introduce standardised, mandatory nutrition labelling relating to per 100 g/100 ml amounts, thereby allowing consumers to compare products on the supermarket shelves. All the existing food labelling is voluntary, sometimes confusing and difficult to compare. Mandatory labelling which shows the nutritional value of foods will give consumers the information they need to make informed purchasing decisions. Consumers are increasingly being misled or deceived about food. We only need to think of imitation cheese on pizza, reconstituted ham, ice cream that contains no milk and chocolate biscuits without chocolate. Often, cheap substitutes or aromas are used. All these imitation products must, in future, be labelled as such. The food labelling regulation is a major success on behalf of European consumers, which is why I have supported it. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, I am not convinced with regard to all of the points of the compromise, but I know that the new regulation represents a definite improvement on the current legal situation. First of all, we will get a standardised European technical language for the performance of construction products and streamlined and simplified procedures. We have made progress with the European internal market and, in so doing, we have benefited the companies and also, through standardised safety requirements, the consumers, too. In principle, I regard relief from bureaucratic regulations for micro-enterprises to be important and sensible. However, we also need to take account of the fact that micro-enterprises that process construction products are also users and must also be protected. I am therefore pleased that my proposal was included in the compromise. This provides for simplified procedures for micro-enterprises in connection with the evaluation of the performance characteristics of construction products. However, if they apply such a procedure, they must prove the equivalence of the procedure used with the procedure that is actually provided for throughout Europe. This is the only way to ensure that the details of the performance characteristics are also accurate and reliable and that the safety of buildings is also ensured throughout Europe. Anja Weisgerber,

 Mr President, Commissioner Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, those who helped produce this report and everyone who contributed to this splendid result. Without the constructive and very open collaboration with both the Commission and with the Belgian Presidency of the Council, it would not be possible to conclude this package tomorrow. As I am sure you can imagine, I am very satisfied with this result. The repeal of a total of eight outdated and obsolete directives will enable us to take another step in the direction of less bureaucracy in Europe. What is interesting in said directives is that they largely became obsolete because they have already been replaced by international standards that represent the latest state of the art. Member State rules and regulations are often rendered obsolete by harmonised European rules and regulations, after all. In this case, European rules and regulations have become superfluous thanks to international stipulations. If we want to make progress towards our target of having 25% less bureaucracy in Europe by 2012, we need to nail our colours to the mast now. To put it in the words of the Chair of the High Level Group of Independent Stakeholders on Administrative Burdens, Edmund Stoiber, we in Europe must not only purse our lips, we need to whistle loudly. In other words, our words must be followed up by tangible action. When it comes to that action, the devil is often in the detail, however. This directive repealing eight directives relating to metrology has shown this clearly once again. Measuring instruments for cold water meters for non-clean water, alcohol meters, certain weights, tyre pressure gauges and equipment to measure the standard mass of grain or the size of ship tanks have been replaced, in practice, by more modern digital equipment. The outdated equipment is used increasingly rarely and the rules governing such equipment can thus be abolished. There are also no consequences for the functioning of the internal market or for the high standard of consumer protection, which remains of great importance to us. Yet the Council has been blocking this package for some time. We have managed, however, to reach a reasonable compromise between the Council and Parliament in the informal trialogue, and even to do so at first reading – which is always the exception rather than the rule for us. The substance of that agreement is as follows: one directive – namely that concerning the calibration of ship tanks – is to be repealed immediately, which is to say, with effect from 1 July 2011, while the remaining seven directives will be repealed once the recast version of the Framework Measuring Instruments Directive (MID), which the Commission is currently working on, has been adopted. The Commission will produce a new proposal for the MID by the end of April 2011. The idea is that the Commission, when reviewing the MID, will also examine whether and, if so, what elements from the old directives should be retained and should therefore be incorporated into the MID to that end. If the Member States provide evidence that certain elements within the seven directives are still necessary, for example, on consumer protection grounds, such as provisions from the directive relating to tyre pressure gauges for motor vehicles, these sections will be incorporated into the Framework Measuring Instruments Directive. Once the recast version of the MID has been adopted, the remaining directives will be repealed. This is a signal that Europe is serious about cutting red tape and that we are eager to create the conditions for sustainable economic growth. I am proud of the fact that the European Parliament is doing its bit, in this way, to help cut red tape and to produce better, more streamlined and simpler lawmaking. Allow me just to conclude with a brief word about the correlation tables. These are the tables that the Member States are supposed to draw up in order to document how they have implemented the directive. In the end, we agreed on a less strict wording in this regard. We fought for stricter wordings in future, however, and we achieved our goal in this regard. The Conference of Presidents will champion this cause accordingly to the Council and the Commission. This represents a success that we have the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs to thank for. Anja Weisgerber, 
 rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow Members, including my appreciation of their valuable contributions to the debate tonight. After the vote in the morning, we need to shift our focus to the future. Naturally, we are looking forward to seeing how the individual rules and regulations turn out – the Commission has now announced that it will table its proposal for the Measuring Instruments Directive (MID) by the end of April. It will then also be possible to check whether any of the individual legislative regimes that we are removing from circulation are to be incorporated. It is important, as Mrs Comi also said, that no legal vacuum arises. Mrs Gebhardt, I can tell you that that was also a very important concern for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and it was one that we were able to follow up on. For me, however, it is also important to mention that the Member States are required to document even more strictly why certain aspects or elements should be retained, as it is only in those circumstances that we really need European regulations; they are not an end in themselves. I am also looking forward to the Internet consultation that the Commission has announced and which will take place between 6 September and 1 November 2011. The consultation will also involve the companies affected, the authorities and so forth. Once again, I will be listening closely to businesses. When it comes to the existing directive, too, I checked whether these measuring instruments were still in use and, as it happened, the response every single time – for example, from my wine growing association, which I asked about alcohol meters – was that such items of equipment certainly are not used any longer. We therefore need to look very closely into this. If we really do want to make progress towards this target of cutting red tape in Europe by 25% by 2012 – and that, of course, is no longer very far away – we need to make major progress in this area. We, as Parliament, are ready to play a part. Finally, I just have one more thing to say about the correlation tables. I want to state, at this point, that, once again, what we have here is a compromise, but, with regard to the future, I would like to call on the Member States to commit to actually drawing up these tables because this really is about a uniform implementation of the rules and regulations throughout Europe.

 Mr President, in relation to the adoption of the Toys Directive, I would like to point out that, when we adopted the directive, we had an objective in mind, namely, making children’s toys safer, as children, in particular, still growing and developing as they are, have a particularly sensitive reaction to hazardous substances and chemicals. Considering the most up-to-date scientific knowledge at that point, we laid down the strictest requirements anywhere in the world for toys through European legislation. As every year, this issue comes to the fore in the run-up to Christmas, and for me personally, too, as a mother-to-be, this issue is one that is close to my heart, and I think it is very important that we have the strictest standards. That is why I helped initiate this debate. I did so in the light of new expert opinions that have concluded that the strictest limit values for heavy metals are not strict enough, given the latest scientific knowledge. We included a clause in the directive specifically for cases like this, which makes it possible to modify and tighten up the limit values at a later date, and we now need to make use of that clause. Commissioner Tajani, that was something that we also called on your predecessor to do a year ago. I am pleased that, as I understand it, the Commission is to announce today, at least, that the limit values for certain heavy metals are to be tightened up, albeit with a delay from when we called on it to do so and certainly encouraged by the debate today. In general, however, we need to review all hazardous substances, and we should not, therefore, restrict ourselves to the heavy metals. Instead, we need to look into the latest information on the hazardous substances known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Should it also turn out that it is necessary to amend the limit values in order to protect our children, I call for a rectification of the legislation in this regard, too. At the end of the day, this is about the safety of our children. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Christofer Fjellner, and his shadow rapporteurs. Under difficult conditions, and despite battling against a severe headwind, a very good result has genuinely been achieved with this report. The Commission proposal has been improved considerably. A strict ban on advertising remains: there will be no information on the radio, television or in magazines; instead, patients must actively seek out the information. I base my position on the idea that patients are responsible people. They want to be informed, and I would very much like to help them achieve that. I therefore also want the patient to be at the centre of the information. I would like to focus on two key points. I myself have said in no uncertain terms – including in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – that I would like to see health portals on the Internet and similar information in printed media. Our citizens often look things up on the Internet, where they often come across poor and uncontrolled information. We must therefore counter this with an alternative: controlled information. Pharmacovigilance was a first success, with the adoption of drug safety portals that included the package leaflets and information on the medicines. However, I would like to go beyond this, Commissioner, and would have liked to have seen comprehensive Internet portals that also provide information on illnesses and prevention. If I have understood you correctly, you support this in principle, but perhaps have not said so in this dossier. I would like the Commissioner to make a clear statement as to whether he also supports this. I consider this to be a very, very important matter. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, our heartfelt thanks go to the rapporteur. The directive on electrical and electronic equipment is highly controversial. There were great differences of opinion regarding various aspects. I am therefore pleased that agreement has been reached and at what I regard as the good result of the trialogue negotiations. I would specifically like to reiterate two points. One is the question of the scope. What equipment should the directive actually cover? There is one thing that we must not forget: originally, it was meant to cover domestic appliances – in other words, white goods. The open scope now includes many new product groups, which would also have encompassed technologies for renewable energy. I must point out that this directive actually had a quite different objective. Naturally, much stricter and higher standards of protection need to be applied in the case of domestic appliances than in the case of technologies such as those that are uninstalled, recycled, etc. by specialist personnel. That is why I, in turn, advocated the exemption of renewable energies. I was not in favour of expanding the scope, but then I saw that a majority was moving in that direction. I think it would have been counterproductive to include renewable energy in this directive. It would have resulted in a competitive disadvantage and therefore I think it is the right decision. Then I would like to say something about Annex III: I would have had concerns about including a further 37 substances as priority substances when there is no real justification on health grounds for a future ban on these. I think that would be a panic measure, and that is why I think the decision made is the right one and am pleased about this aspect of the result too. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs very much for their excellent work. Effective supervision of medical products provides protection for the citizens of Europe and, at the same time, gives more power to responsible patients. Two points in particular are very important to me: the safety web portal for medicines and the patient information leaflet (PIL). The positive news is that tomorrow’s resolution will introduce safety web portals for medicines into all the Member States, where the approved patient information leaflet and other information must be published. This will put an end to an untenable situation. In many Member States, it is not possible to publish the PIL on the web. However, this is not in line with the real lives of many citizens who make use of the right of free movement within the European Union. Now they will be able to download PILs from the web in their own language anywhere in Europe. This will also be useful for patients who have lost their PIL. At the same time, I want the PIL to be improved and I am very pleased about the resolution calling on the Commission to submit draft legislation on this subject. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

 Mr President, today’s good news is that the new legislation will provide uniform, mandatory nutritional labelling that relates to 100 grams, thereby providing greater comparability. Statements of nutritional value provide consumers with information that allows them to make an informed purchasing decision. The model I have in my mind is that of the responsible consumer who knows what he is buying. Imitation products that are not clearly marked as such deliberately mislead consumers. Imitation cheese, pressed ham products, vanilla yoghurt that contains no vanilla whatsoever – these are just a few examples. All these imitation products must be labelled as such. I am pleased that we will send a clear signal to the Council tomorrow and that all of us here are agreed that we need better labelling. As far as I am concerned, the task is to provide information; we should leave consumers to make up their own minds, however. That is why I am against traffic light labelling. There are no unhealthy foods – only unhealthy, unbalanced diets. The traffic lights are misleading. I am in favour of food labelling according to the GDA model and am pleased that we are likely to vote to move towards this tomorrow. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

 Mr President, I just wanted to say that my voting machine has stopped working. I have not been able to take part in the last three votes. I would be grateful if you could send a technician. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

 Mr President, consumer protection is a very, very important matter for me and therefore I am against consumers being misled or deceived in any way. This is why I am fighting for better labelling of food imitations in the Regulation on the labelling of foodstuffs, for example. I am calling on the Council to follow this approach, which is also supported by the Commission. Today, we had to vote on glued meat. Glued meat is meat which is glued together and sold as a high-quality product. In my opinion, this should not be happening, in particular, when consumers are not aware of what is going on. The decision today was not an easy one for me. The Commission has proposed comprehensive labelling rules, but consumers may still be misled, because it is difficult to prove that a product contains thrombin. This means that it may be used but not indicated on the label. Therefore, I think a labelling requirement is not sufficient in this case. I have now voted in favour of the resolution and of a ban on thrombin. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, the climate negotiations in Copenhagen were disappointing for the European Union, as has already been mentioned. The result was a long way from the EU position and from the position that we need to be in to protect the climate. The only positive aspect is the recognition of the two-degree goal, as this could lead to the necessary reduction commitments. We must now ask ourselves what we can learn from the failure of the negotiations and what we should do next. It is important to have a period of reflection and to take a critical look at different points on the route that we have been following. We have to ask ourselves how we can make progress jointly with other states. How can we ensure that the EU is also present at the table when the US, China and India meet to negotiate a compromise? How can we negotiate more effectively with the developing countries and emerging economies? Is it essential that these negotiations take place under the aegis of the UN? Finally, I would like to say how pleased I am that I was able to vote for the resolution, because in my opinion, it continues to emphasise the pioneering role played by the European Union. We must now answer these questions and continue on our current path, both from a domestic and an international perspective. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank you most sincerely for the clarity of your words. Essentially, it should be said that, overall, the Toys Directive has brought a considerable improvement in the protection of our children. We all approached it with the intention of producing the most stringent legislation anywhere in the world. However, many parents and grandparents are now concerned – as you said – because of the studies by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. We now need to ask ourselves whether or not the Institute’s statements and opinion are right. In any case, we need to examine the facts of the matter very closely. It is a question of the protection of our children. At this point, I would like to thank you most sincerely for having stated that you are willing to do that. However, I think that things need to move more quickly. Not until next year, you say, during the first half of the year, will the findings of the scientific committee be available. It must be done quicker than that. It is a question of the protection of our children. I really cannot understand why the Federal Institute left it so long to come out with these statements. I want to make that point here, too. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the German conservative group (CSU) would like to see clear and practical rules for the protection of non-smokers being introduced throughout Europe. However, in my opinion, ‘throughout Europe’ does not necessarily mean ‘from within Europe’. Many Member States already have in place regulations for protecting non-smokers and others are in the process of introducing regulations of this kind. I do not believe – in common with the majority of my fellow Members in the European Parliament, which is very pleasing – that we in Brussels must impose regulations for the protection of non-smokers or that we are able to do this more effectively. The European Union has no authority in this area. We are only responsible for health and safety at work. This is where the problem lies, because for me the most important issue is protecting children and young people and this group, which specifically needs protection, would not be covered by regulations that refer only to health and safety at work. Therefore, the Member States must take action in this area. I have voted in favour and I am pleased that this amendment was accepted. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
).

Madam President, we need clear and practical rules for the protection of non-smokers to be introduced throughout Europe. However, in my opinion ‘throughout Europe’ does not necessarily mean ‘from Europe’. Many Member States already have in place legislation to protect non-smokers and others are in the process of introducing laws of this kind. Why are some of my fellow Members now saying that we in Brussels can do this much better than the Member States, regardless of the fact that the European Union has no authority on health policy and that we have to implement this via the circuitous route of health and safety at work? In my opinion, the Member States should decide which regulations to put in place to protect non-smokers. This makes sense, because they are closer to the local problems and issues. I do not understand why Brussels should impose protection for non-smokers in Lapland and in Andalusia which is identical in every detail. What has happened to the cross-border implications? We in Brussels have come up against our limits in this respect. For me, protecting children and young people is particularly important. We need comprehensive protection in this area. If we introduce protection for non-smokers on a European level via health and safety at work, we are not protecting children and young people, because they are not employees. Therefore, I would ask you to support Amendments 2 and 13 put forward by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Manfred Weber,

Mr President, Vice-President Reding, Mr Mavroyiannis, ladies and gentlemen, in July, contrary to existing laws, an impartial Ombudsman who has long campaigned against corruption was replaced by a government with someone who is willing to tow the party line. Two pieces of emergency legislation were passed that drastically reduce the powers of the constitutional court and change the legal position for a referendum to suspend the president from office while the case is in progress. An extremely dubious suspension procedure was pursued against the state president that was no longer under the supervision of the constitutional court as a result of the emergency legislation. The quorum requirements of the constitutional court were ignored. Finally, there are reports of irregularities in the electoral lists for the referendum on the suspension of the office of president, indicating that the electoral lists were even changed after the ballot was complete. To cap it all: constitutional lawyers and advocates have received personal threats during the process. As I read this list, you might think I am talking about a banana republic in some obscure part of the world. However, I am, in fact, talking about reports that we received during the summer from Romania, a Member State of the European Union. These reports and the discussions we have had to hold about them are disappointing and quite simply unacceptable. I am therefore pleased and grateful that the President of the Commission and, above all, our Vice-President, Ms Reding, have responded in a committed and decisive manner, demanding an explanation from Romania. It is unacceptable, however, for Prime Minister Ponta to promise the President of the Commission that the illegal and highly undemocratic emergency legislation will be repealed, while doing nothing at home in Romania. On the contrary, Mr Ponta has exploited the opportunity to bad-mouth the European Union. This is unworthy of a democratically elected prime minister and shows a profoundly undemocratic attitude of mind. Thanks again to the Commission for its decisive stance. The citizens of Romania and of Europe as a whole appreciate this. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Manfred Weber  (PPE

 I am happy to answer this question because Mr Paşcu is surely aware that neither he, nor I, nor Prime Minister Ponta is entitled to assess whether or not a court is biased in its decisions. A constitutional court is independent and, as such, is required to reach independent decisions, which both of us need to accept. You come from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. Your party has now decided not to hold your party congress in Bucharest because all party leaders in Europe say: I refuse to be photographed with Ponta. This is the reality and this is why I would ask the social democrats to go to Bucharest and say: see to it that the rule of law is implemented. Manfred Weber,

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the discussion of Schengen has generated a lot of headlines in Europe in recent weeks. For that reason, it is good that we are discussing this matter in Parliament today. I would like to start by indicating the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for the Commissioner in respect of the examination of the very specific detailed accusations in the European Union, and if it is found that offences have been committed at European internal borders, they should be properly investigated by the Commission, because the PPE Group wants a strong European authority that will monitor Schengen status in future. That brings us to the real debate, which is one that, ultimately, concerns us all. With its decision on the Schengen rules, the Council was itself probably not altogether clear on what it was hoping to achieve, because it has not only set out on a path that we consider to be dubious in terms of content, it has also, by choosing a new legal basis, departed from the path of cooperation with Members of this House. The Council has also interfered in one of Europe’s most important achievements, namely the open borders. For us, Schengen means freedom in place of borders, cooperation in place of egoism and working together instead of working against one another. The freedom to travel in Europe is the PPE Group’s top priority. The people, the economy and indeed the whole of Europe will benefit from this. We do not want the open borders, which are a visible feature of European cooperation, to be disproportionately restricted, particularly at a time when more European spirit is needed. As the PPE Group, we want the Member States to stop doing secret deals with each other on how essential rights of their citizens are to be dealt with. This method has failed; we must focus on the Community method. The PPE Group wants the decision making to come out of the diplomatic backrooms and the decisions on these new legal bases to be made by the elected bodies in which citizens are represented. The PPE Group will fight to retain these rights in Europe. As far as the content is concerned, we do not see any insurmountable obstacles. The question is whether we will actually find a way forward in this process together. I have to say, Mr Mavroyiannis, that this is not the way for family members to treat each other. It destroys the spirit of European cooperation. We therefore ask the Council to return to the path of cooperation, and – as you said yourself today – more intensive contact is not enough for the European Parliament. We are legislators and we are involved in the decision, and for that reason I would ask you to withdraw your decision on the legal basis and involve Parliament as an equal legislator. Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we want to use the time tomorrow to discuss the current political situation in Romania, for three essential reasons. Firstly, we have all read in the newspapers that the matter at issue is a dispute about whether the Prime Minister is responsible for his doctoral thesis. His doctoral thesis is not our affair, however. Our subject instead is what is being done to the ethics commission in Romania responsible for resolving such incidents, which is a source of indignation for us – how people are being appointed ex post facto
, how the ethics commission is being padded out, in order to possibly reach different results, and also how these results are being published in the official gazette, amended between Parliament and the government, in order to be able to react as quickly as possible and to be able to water down disagreeable judgments. The second thing that bothers us is the issue of what happened to the public television service in Romania. The legal basis for public service television in Romania states that the parliamentary groups are to be represented proportionately in the monitoring committees, while the people who have now been appointed all belong to the government’s political group, which is thus a violation of the law. The third request that we have, the third consideration that bothers us, is probably the most weighty, the most difficult, which is Romania’s representation at the European Council at the end of the week. I say this as there has been a dispute between the President and the Prime Minister as to who will represent Romania at the summit. This question was put to the Romanian constitutional court, which unambiguously decided that the President is responsible for representing the country abroad. The Prime Minister, meanwhile, has rejected this decision by the constitutional court and mobilised his parliamentary group to fight back. All of these are points where we ask the question of whether a prime minister is in a position to adhere to the democratic ground rules, the ground rules according to the constitution, or whether he wants to lead his country into a constitutional crisis. (Heckling)
 We therefore ask to debate this. Those Members who were heckling should bear in mind that we, as Parliament, need to take a critical view of developments – seriously, Mr Swoboda – and not view them through our party political spectacles. We should at least have the opportunity to discuss this – no more and no less! Anyone with nothing to hide need not be afraid of a debate. Manfred Weber,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would urge that we vote now. We have had two months to discuss this subject in depth. There has been a lot of discussion between the groups. Then, in the last few days, pressure from the genetic engineering lobby was also added to the mix, and this has now caused confusion once again. We are of the opinion that we have discussed all there is to discuss and that a decision can now be taken. There are two arguments: our citizens are expecting signals from us with regard to how we are going to deal with biopatents, and the European Patent Office is also expecting clear signals from Parliament on how the current law is to be implemented. That is why we should decide today. Manfred Weber  (PPE
), 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Bødskov, we should admit to each other that we are all struggling to uphold data protection for our European citizens. We should also listen seriously to what Mr Watson underlined in his short speech, namely that the fight against terrorism is a common cause and that the people who experienced the terror attack in Toulouse should also be remembered in this House. We need to weigh up both arguments. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) clearly recognises the United States of America as our partner in the global challenge that is the fight against terror. We see the US as a partner and wish to work with it. I believe that we should avoid getting involved in this role play where the US is the bad guy that wants our data, while we Europeans reap the benefits of the results of the analyses, which will, after all, also be available to the European authorities. We must all shoulder our responsibilities, which means that we Europeans must take action. Every country has the sovereign right to decide how people enter its territory and what information it requires. Just as we are in discussions on this issue with Canada and Australia, so we are now also in discussions with the US. This agreement will offer us greater legal certainty. Anyone voting against the agreement is voting for less legal certainty. These are the alternatives on offer today. I would like to thank the Commissioner for making it clear that Europe is stronger when it acts collectively and that the European Union can achieve more than 27 countries negotiating separately. The PPE Group supports partnership with the US, which is why I would like to take a look towards the future. The reason why we are discussing a framework agreement on data protection is because the interchange of data will become more important in the future. For this reason, I would also call on the US to stay at the negotiating table and to take the Europeans’ offer seriously, so that we can draw up global standards for data exchange and data protection. If we in Europe and the US manage to conclude a joint framework agreement, then there is a chance that we will be able to establish global standards. This would represent genuine added value for the citizens of Europe. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Weber, Manfred  (PPE

 Mr Tavares, any criminal investigator working in the fight against terrorism will tell you that it is never one item of information that solves a case, but rather the overall picture built up. It is a question of how terror funds itself. It is a question of who has had phone contact with a terrorist. That is why we need to discuss data retention. It is also a question of the movement profile of a terrorist or possible perpetrator. The overall picture is what counts. I never claimed that just one data record would provide a result. What I did say, however, is that we need to uphold the data protection interests of our citizens, while at the same time considering what authority and what data we need to give to criminal investigators to enable them to do their job, namely to foil future terror attacks. Careful consideration is needed here. Those who reject the agreement today must also respect the fact that some data will simply remain unavailable. I said nothing more.

 Mr Albrecht, when I speak with criminal investigators, they tell me that we would have been unable to uncover a whole host of activities ahead of terrorist acts if it were not for our partnership with the US. This is what criminal investigators tell me. It is for this reason that I say that the United States of America is a partner of Europe in the joint war against terror. As I believe the United States to be a fair partner, I am happy to sit down with it to hammer out an agreement. This does not give carte blanche
 to all the countries of the world. If you are implying that we would equate our partnership with the United States with a partnership with China, then I am afraid I must disagree with you. I regard the United States as a true partner. I believe that this agreement will strengthen the Commission’s capacity to monitor the US and what it does with these data and whether it plays by the rules in implementing what has been agreed between us. I want a strong Europe. I also accept the United States as a fair partner that wishes to join us in the joint fight against terror.

 Unlawful? This question can be evaluated in political terms. You seem to disagree with me on this. If we take a look at the agreement, we have an organisation that has the right of initiative when it comes to negotiating an agreement and the resources to evaluate it, namely the Commission. The Commission’s legal services have stated that the agreement is in order. This is the legal situation. If others disagree, whether fellow Members of the House, Member States, or European governments, then they are completely at liberty to take the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union and to have it examined there. That is our legal system. I have absolutely no problem with that. However, to imply that a person is contradicting the law, despite the fact that the Commission’s legal services’ indicate that it is in order, is taking things too far. If this agreement is rejected, I am inclined to ask myself how you intend to explain to our citizens that we will find ourselves in a legal vacuum in which the United States will negotiate directly with the airlines and possibly even with the individual Member States. How will you explain to citizens that there are no longer any ground rules in relation to this data exchange issue. That is the issue facing us right now. Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have principles in the European Union, including the independence of the judiciary and the central bank and fundamental democratic rights. If there are any doubts about these fundamental rights or principles, we need to discuss them. The right place for these discussions is here in the European Parliament. For this reason, I would like to emphasise specifically how grateful I am to Mr Orbán, the Prime Minister of Hungary, for coming here. He was not invited. He said: I will take part in the discussion, because we have nothing to hide. I would like to emphasise too that Mr Orbán is here and is listening while many of those Members who were so hysterical and dramatic that they could hardly contain themselves have obviously already left the Chamber. He is still here and we should acknowledge that. If we leave the party politics to one side, the facts are quite simple: Europe has ground rules which apply to all of us. The job of the Commission is to ensure that everyone follows these rules and that is what it has done. The Hungarian Government has already promised on several occasions to deal with these problems and to make the necessary changes. These are the facts. If we could simply put aside the political hysteria, then we would be able to talk objectively about the situation. I have heard nothing new today from those on the left concerning the facts. Mr Swoboda stands up and says that the judiciary may be independent. Then I hear from Mr Orbán that there was absolutely no criticism of the constitution. Next Mr Verhofstadt says that this is not about individual legal details. It is about the fundamental question of whether Hungary is still democratic. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) stand for law and justice. If anyone has a criticism, they must substantiate it objectively and in terms of its content with regard to the judicial issues and not simply claim that someone has acted undemocratically. What we are experiencing in many areas is quite simply an arbitrary approach. If I do not like a specific aspect of the legislation in Hungary, I describe it as undemocratic, radical and right-wing or totalitarian. We in the PPE Group will not tolerate this. Finally, I would like to say that I have been working in this Parliament since 2004. I was involved with the case of Slovakia, which introduced a law banning the use of the Hungarian language there. All of the people on the left who are now getting so angry … (Heckling)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that is precisely the method which is preventing us from discussing the situation objectively. Personal attacks and defamatory statements are being made with regard to the subjects under discussion. I have no doubts about my fellow Member Mr Szájer and I have no reservations about his wife, although I do not know her. Also I would like to say that if we are really taking parliaments and parliamentarianism seriously, then the European Parliament must take seriously the decisions of the Hungarian Parliament, which has the support of a two-thirds majority of the citizens. This should also be taken into account in the discussion. (Applause) Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Swoboda, saying rather offensively as an Austrian and as Chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament that you are motivated by love of Hungary and then saying to the Prime Minister of the freely elected Hungarian Parliament that you are doing this out of love, I personally find rather impertinent. You are insinuating that the freely elected Prime Minister is not doing things out of love. Therefore, I would like to ask you how you come to say that you are acting only out of love of Hungary. I believe that the freely elected Prime Minister is also acting out of love. Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, two weeks ago, the European Council met. After the summit, the Heads of State or Government appeared before the media and told the citizens of Europe how proud they were of Schengen and that they would defend Schengen against the attacks on it. When I heard these statements from our leading EU politicians, I thought to myself, ‘how bad have things got that it is now viewed as a success to defend Schengen?’ Schengen was a given that we had created in Europe, yet suddenly it is up for discussion again. The key question is how can we deal with the popularism we can sense on the Right? I think we need to take a two-pronged approach. The first element is that we need to convince people again that the project is right. We need to answer the assertion that security is improved through the introduction of border controls by explaining that it was only with the introduction of the Schengen Information System, through partnership and cooperation, that security was improved. I live in the border area between Bavaria and the Czech Republic. In my area, security has improved since border controls were abolished, as we now work with the Czech authorities. Even before abolishing the border controls, we have had more success in fighting crime in Romania and Bulgaria simply thanks to the exchange of information within the framework of the Schengen Information System. We need to convince people and win them back to the project. We need to win their hearts and I would like to see the Commission do more in this regard. Commissioner Malmström yesterday went on record saying that there had not been any problems so far in Denmark. While she may have been legally accurate, she offered too little political argument. We are not fighting for the hearts and minds of the people at this point in the way we should be. As Parliament, we can reassure the citizens that we take the Treaty of Lisbon seriously. We shall defend the Schengen agreement against all attacks that it may face with all the power we have as MEPs. If the Schengen acquis
 is to be amended, we shall ensure that it emerges from the changes stronger rather than weaker. Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the European Parliament is a very hard-working body, however we need to pay more attention to a balance in the voting times, so that we do not have a situation where there is nothing to vote on one day and an enormous number of votes the next. That is why I am now proposing that we should stop voting now and defer the remaining business to the next plenary sitting. (Applause)
 There are no issues on the agenda that are so pressing that a vote is absolutely necessary today. We have already voted on the legislative points. I believe that this was the most important thing for now. (Applause) Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, a lot has already been said with regard to Greece. I would just like to add two thoughts on this matter. The first is that, despite all the concern and fear being felt by the people, we must not lose sight of the principles. The two principles that define Europe are solidarity – we stand by this – and a sense of individual responsibility – that the Greek people and all those who receive acts of solidarity also take responsibility themselves. The second thought is that mention has been made of the big test for Europe and of the concern that the project could perhaps even fail and that old ghosts that we had thought we had eradicated could return to the European Union. I would like to turn all of this around and look at it in a positive light. We should not just talk about the problems, but also about the successes. For example, we should mention that some of the Baltic States have managed to overcome the crisis and that, with European support, Ireland will succeed in returning to the bond markets next year. This could also be a big opportunity to prove to the people that we are stronger together than we are alone. In this context, it is quite difficult to deal with the second major issue for the Council meeting, namely that of migration. However, there is a nice link that connects the two issues, because in relation to the migration issue, in particular Schengen, we also see the same principle at work, namely that one of Europe’s major successes is now being called into question as a result of national egotism. I am sure that we have all seen the figures indicating that 18 000 refugees have arrived in Italy. However, we all know that, for Italy, 18 000 refugees is hardly an excessive burden, because twice as many refugees have been received in the last year in Belgium alone. It was therefore not right of Italy to react in the way that it did. It was internal policymaking by Italy’s minister of reforms, Umberto Bossi. On account of a few hundred people, France responded by reintroducing border controls, and that, too, was for domestic political reasons. In Denmark, too, the reasons were of an internal political nature. I would therefore like clear signals to be sent out from the Council meeting. When the question of migration and Schengen is discussed, the Heads of State or Government of the European Union must respond with the clear message that we do not want national egotism, in particular in this area. Instead we want to defend the huge success that is a free Europe. Mr Barroso, you will certainly have Parliament’s support in that. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, fundamental human rights are universal, which means that they are applicable in every situation. I have been listening to the debate. None of the speakers so far, including the critics, has quoted the constitution to indicate exactly what it is they do not like. Mr López Aguilar says that he gets the impression that something has gone awry, while others are making insinuations about all the things that could go wrong with this constitution. Not one person has actually quoted from the constitution itself. That is precisely the problem that faces us in this discussion: where are the actual accusations? When I consider how the Hungarians will react to this debate and to the accusations being bandied about by some of my fellow Members without any support from direct quotations, then I can well imagine that some will find the way that the Hungarians and their country’s development are being discussed here to be extremely arrogant. As Europeans, we should take care to avoid leaving ourselves open to such accusations. I would like to state that many of those in positions of responsibility in Hungary today are the people who took to the streets to fight against communism and for liberty. It is simply unacceptable that accusations should be continuously made against these people and that the impression should be created that they are experiencing problems with freedom. This has nothing to do with party politics; it is simply a fact. Having complained that no quotes have been used during this debate, I would now like to quote from the new Hungarian constitution: ‘We are proud of the fact that our country has been part of Christian Europe for 1 000 years and we are aware of the role of Christianity in sustaining our nation’. I am pleased to find such sentiments in a constitution. This may not please all Members of this House. I am pleased that this reference to Christianity has been included and I would also have liked to have seen it included in the Treaty of Lisbon and in the European constitution. My position, as a representative of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is that this is a good thing. Manfred Weber  (PPE

Madam President, Mr Alvaro, you have just demonstrated how to extend your speaking time by accepting numerous questions.

As a representative of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to pose a question to the President of the Commission, who has been busy dealing with the pictures that we have been seeing in recent weeks from the Mediterranean, where many people fleeing from the situation in Africa have made it to Europe, while some have also failed to make it. We have had to see the images of these stranded and dead people on the news. We are all aware that it is a joint European challenge facing us to find an answer to this drama and this misery for refugees. On behalf of the PPE Group, I would like to ask the President of the Commission to give us an appraisal of whether the Commission – and, above all, Frontex – has enough resources, whether we, the European Union, have enough capabilities to respond on the ground, and whether we have enough statutory bases to enable Europe to act together in the Mediterranean region. I would also be interested to hear what form the discussions with the countries of origin (Tunisia and Egypt, for example) take and whether we Europeans are making headway in this area. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, my thanks for your assessments of the situation. Given that you state that we currently need more resources for Frontex, I would be interested to hear whether you are not also of the opinion that the Member States have hitherto been too unwilling to provide the resources to make Frontex strong. We did have the toolbox already. Was it the case that there was too little willingness on the part of the Member States to support Frontex accordingly? Manfred Weber,

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, as has already been emphasised, Schengen is one of the great achievements of our common European project. Citizens notice it on a daily basis when travelling around Europe. It is the realisation of the dream of Europe – a Europe without border controls. It must therefore first be made clear in this debate – particularly in view of the debate that has taken place in recent weeks – that we in this House will jointly ensure that this principle and the idea behind it are not derailed by any initiative or any debate. We will defend this principle in the European Parliament. In recent weeks there have been discussions concerning more than 25 000 refugees from Tunisia who have arrived in the Italian territory of Lampedusa. Yet a country such as Sweden has been accepting more than 25 000 people a year for years on end. There have been states that have accommodated much greater numbers of people relative to their own population that is currently happening on the southern border of Europe, yet nobody has ever thought of questioning Schengen because of the burden. I would therefore like to clearly stress at this stage that it is a pity that we seriously need to have a debate in Europe, of all places, on Schengen status as a result of this challenge that we must deal with together. Secondly, I should like to make it clear that we practise solidarity. When it comes to countries such as Malta – a small country that is massively affected and which has no hinterland – then we are currently practising solidarity. In addition to this solidarity, however, I should like to stress that the second basic principle is the responsibility that the countries themselves have. I must therefore also ask the Commission to look more into this. If courts in the European Union are now ruling that Dublin II is to be ineffective – in other words, that refugees are not to be deported to their states of first arrival – then we must ask the Commission how committed it will be to taking action against those states that are obviously not currently implementing the existing law. We are talking here about minimum standards in the European Union. I am therefore calling on the Commission to take action here, too. As regards the preparation for the Council, I have just three points to make. The first is that when it comes to migration then naturally we must expect more migration in the long term as a result of demographic change, but here in the European Union we currently have 24 million people without work and in Spain the youth unemployment rate is 30%. We should therefore proceed cautiously – very cautiously – when it comes to the issue of migration. My second point concerns strengthening Frontex, as has already been mentioned. My third point is that I would ask us all to ensure that those states that were about to join Schengen, namely Bulgaria and Rumania, are not left behind because of the current debate. They have done the work; they have made efforts. We are not asking for lower standards for joining, but if they meet the standards then it is only fair that Bulgaria and Rumania also have the right to become members of the Schengen area.

Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, transparency is a cornerstone of democracy, ensuring that people know who exerts influence and how decisions are made. Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament has significantly more power. That is why it is right that our modus operandi
 should always be open to debate and that we should question ourselves. The negotiations between the European Parliament and the Commission in relation to the transparency register are a success and we have now produced an excellent result. I would like to underline once again that it is good that we have found clear regulations for the local and regional authorities, and even for churches, that reflect their interests. I would also like to say that we do not regard lobbyism as something bad per se. We need expert opinions and we need to be able to call on experts for our work. In the end it is important that we, as parliamentarians, should be able to consider issues freely and make decisions independently. I would now like to state that we parliamentarians have a lot to be proud of. If we conduct a national comparison, we will see that there are only a few Member States of the European Union who have already established a transparency register at this level. In my country’s capital, Berlin, where I also happen to live, there is no such transparency register, which is why we should all be aware that this is a truly significant step forward. To the Council I would say: if this issue is not a problem for the Council because lobbyists have very little influence there, then it should be easier for it to sign up to the transparency register. Accordingly, the Council may be able to conquer its internal resistance. Finally, Madam President, I would point out that if we in Parliament want to escape the influence of lobbyists to a greater extent in future, then we will need greater supports and more staff, enabling us to achieve more for the citizens of the European Union. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).

Mr President, Mr Barroso, the necessary Treaty modification and the institutional debate that we are holding both demonstrate that, now the Treaty of Lisbon has been in force for just over a year, we can no longer resolve the challenges which the world is presenting us with by means of the Treaty as it currently stands. That is exactly what today’s debate shows. On the other hand, when we talk about the current Treaty, we are told that a wider debate about the Treaty is inconceivable and futile in the light of the situation in the Member States and, in particular in the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic. That is the conflict which we currently find ourselves in. We need more, but we will not be getting it from the Member States. The European Parliament must provide an answer. If we listen to what the citizens are saying today, it is clear that they are aware that we need to introduce changes to the Treaty now. They are asking questions like: ‘How are we going to get the markets under control in the near future?’. This is why we need a strong Europe. However, we must ask ourselves an even more important question, which is: What good is our European project doing at the end of the day? For decades, it has been responsible for peacekeeping and for bringing war on our continent to an end. This morning, I was host to a group of visitors from a school. For young people, war is, thank goodness, no longer an issue. They cannot imagine what war might be like. In our discussions, we now raise the threat of globalisation and explain that we need Europe to keep the evil of globalisation under control, but this is a negative argument. If we want to win over not only the minds, but also the hearts of the people, we must take a step further on the question of what good the European project is doing. We must talk about the pictures and ask ourselves what Europe is achieving and what its job is. When the powerful countries in the world come together, including America, Japan, Europe, Brazil, India and so on, who will raise their hand and ask whether we are paying enough attention to social issues? China will not do so. We will have to do that ourselves. Who will raise their hand and say ‘We need to think about environmental questions’? The Americans will not do that. We will have to highlight the issue. Who will say ‘We want to maintain peace throughout the world and ensure that conflicts do not turn into wars’? We will have to do this with our historical experience. If we look at Tunisia, it is clear that the people there want the same model which we have in Europe. We have a highly attractive way of life. Therefore, when we discuss Treaty issues, when we talk about the way in which our continent functions and the job that we have to do, we must look at the big picture, so that we win not only the minds, but also the hearts of people for our project. Then, we will succeed in gaining acceptance for it at a national level. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule149(8)) Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, on the one hand, it is important that the Member States are in control of the treaties, which is why the modification must take place at this level. On the other hand, we are faced with the question which is implicit in many of the questions that I have attempted to address. Are we reflecting carefully on this, are we taking enough time and being allowed enough time to discuss everything in detail? Or are people’s expectations so high and the pressure of the global challenges so great that we need to be quicker and to act more quickly? For this reason, I do not regard the issue of time as a problem, but we do need to provide answers. We must focus on that. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, asylum policy is a highly topical issue, as we have recently discovered in Lampedusa and in Greece. It is a subject that concerns the people of Europe. We should be proud of what we have achieved in Europe, including our common standards, the proper processing of asylum applications and our way of dealing with children and families. We should be proud of all of this. Europe is an area which offers help and partnership to people suffering persecution all over the world. However, the decisive factor is not what we put on paper in Parliament’s committees, in the Commission and in the Council, but what actually happens on the ground. Belgium and Greece have recently been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for not implementing and not adhering to existing legislation. This makes it clear that the enforcement process is not working. I would like to ask the Commission to make faster progress, alongside its existing action plans. We need to be able to put in place and implement the important standards more quickly within the European Union. In the specific case of Greece, I would like to point out that we have a border that can be secured from both sides. I am disappointed in the way our partner, Turkey, has behaved in this respect. We have signed a readmission agreement with Turkey, which requires the country to do far less than it would have to if it were a member of the European Union. Therefore, I think we should expect Turkey to make a greater effort in this area. No one disputes our sense of solidarity. We want to provide practical help in the form of the European Refugee Fund and Frontex, both in the case of Greece, where aid is already being provided, and in the case of Lampedusa in Italy. European solidarity is not being called into question. It is needed now more than it ever has been. Manfred Weber,  
author.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would also like to use today’s debate to take a general look at the visa policy of the European Union. Firstly, it is important to emphasise, to make ourselves aware, of the great value of this visa policy to the European Union. Since we are a common Europe, a common space for people, we are able to create a common visa policy. Our visa policy is therefore also a sign of European unity – a very successful sign of European unity – and it is important to point that out, particularly in times of crisis. Secondly, we are calling for clear rules of play when it comes to visa facilitation. The technical standards that are to be maintained – at external borders and when issuing passports and identity papers – are clearly set out. We cannot make any political concessions as regards the upholding of these standards. In 2010, we found that in the Balkans, there was initially a focus on technical standards, but political arguments were then advanced with increasing vigour. When it comes to visa facilitation, however, one cannot stop at one country; we have to view the area as a whole. Yes, it is always difficult for us to weigh things up in an individual case. However, the core of the issue is that the technical standards must be upheld; the criteria must remain. I therefore also support our Commissioner when she says that these standards that we are demanding must also be implemented in reality. That is an important task of the Commission, because only then will our visa policy be accepted by our citizens. Thirdly, I would like to mention that we welcome the fact that the last European Justice and Home Affairs Council discussed enabling visa facilitation to be rapidly lifted or withdrawn from individual states if they fail to implement the standards. The example of Serbia showed us that the result was a great influx of asylum seekers. Moving on to my final point, for the time being – when talking about Ukraine and Russia – our group is highly sceptical as regards opening the doors quickly, because we have just seen in the case of Serbia that there will also be negative effects. We should therefore proceed with great caution when it comes to visa policy. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, on the subject of Pakistan: we are debating this at a difficult time for Pakistan, and all of us, I believe, support complete solidarity with the people there who have suffered this disaster. Mr Sógor has already talked specifically about the agreement. Therefore, I would like to make a few comments on the questions relating to European Union readmission agreements with third countries in general. Firstly, these agreements make sense and they are necessary, because we have legislation in Europe that governs immigration. However, if we have legislation that governs immigration then there will also be people who are residing here illegally. It then follows logically that we also need to have repatriation. With regard to many of the principles I have just stated, the Left – the Socialists – are often on our side, but when it comes to specific decisions regarding the actual conclusion of such an agreement, they then refuse to give their consent. I therefore believe that, despite this, we need to remain consistent. Secondly, standard human rights must be respected. The alternative to such an agreement is not, of course, that we have better human rights standards. Anyone who rejects this agreement accepts the fact that we will have 27 different legal standards in the European Union which are not monitored as closely as would be the case at European level. The third, and for me the most important, question is: how can we actually make partnership with third countries attractive in future? I would ask the Commission to work in a more interconnected way in future. If we open up European markets in the world trade negotiations, the third countries must also give us the opportunity to talk about repatriation or, with regard to the question of legal immigration, third countries must be in a position to grant us concessions in connection with repatriation. In other words, a more interconnected way of working is important here. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was no coincidence that we, as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), allowed our colleague, Mrs Járóka, who is the only representative of the Roma minority in this Parliament, to speak first today. This is because the PPE Group would much prefer to talk about the people’s problems today. We do not want to make a political show – we do not care about Mr Sarkozy – we want to discuss the problems we are facing with the Roma minority and how we can help them. This is also the basis of our resolution. Mr Swoboda, you said that it is scandalous that the Commission has drawn this conclusion. All I can say to that is that it is clearly scandalous to you because the Commission is not joining in with the political show that you want to make of this and has made a serious comment on the situation. Secondly, as regards the freedom of movement, everything has been said already. We have clear ground rules in the European Union. The freedom of movement is not without limit; it can be restricted on an individual basis and that is also what has been done in France. My third point is actually the important one. In the political debate on this issue, it is a question of how we can integrate the minorities in Europe into our societies. If we all accept the fact that we are open-minded and tolerant, then we are on common ground. If, as a second step, we also all accept that around 90% move towards the majority society, that we really join together and take integration seriously, then we are also still in agreement. We are divided on the question of how we should deal with migrants – regardless of what sort of migrants – who just do not accept what the majority society has to offer, who refuse to cooperate, and will not accept the ground rules. The Left in this House repeatedly presents the argument that we need to offer these people something. We in the PPE Group say that the migrants also need to accept the offers. If you do not add this requirement and stipulate it in strong terms, if you do not have a state that calls for this, then you destroy the willingness of citizens to integrate people, and you do the handiwork of the Right in this House if you do not permit the state to use this toughness. It is also permissible to say that. (Applause)

 Mr President, thank you for the question. The answer is also quite simple. The question of whether a law has been transposed is not decided in Europe by politicians, or by journalists. In the European Union, it is the courts that decide. In the European Union – and in France, too – we have a situation in which people belonging to the Roma groups concerned can turn to the courts and file a complaint against this on an individual basis. That has already been done. The Commissioner has pointed out that French judges also use European law as the basis for their decisions. Thus, it is not journalists who decide whether or not laws have been implemented in this European Union, it is the courts, and according to the Commission’s statement, that is clearly the way it works in France just as it does in the other Member States of the European Union. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to talk about freedom of expression in the European Union is to cover a broad subject area. I thank the Commission for the broad approach to this matter. This is a debate about principles. From my own country, Germany, I can report that one political party, a political power, namely the Social Democrats, owns newspapers and publishing houses, in other words, it has large newspapers under its control. We citizens repeatedly ask ourselves whether it is good for parties to own parts of the media or whether it would actually be better for these two to be separate. Thus, there is a great deal to discuss with regard to this issue. However, I would like to use today’s debate to talk instead about principles. The media are part of the foundation of our democracy. They inform people of factual circumstances and they scrutinise those who hold power. Of course, this task performed by the media also brings with it a large responsibility to use this power in a responsible manner. In this regard, it is important to protect peoples’ privacy and it is important that news is not reported in order to create a sensation, but to provide reliable information. In that respect, the media are part of the foundation of our civil democracy. Independence is what is most important here. Publishers must grant their journalists independence. In the national structures that we have – we as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) view this as positive, because the media are also part of our culture – we need independence from political influence, and neither must advertising customers influence the work of editorial staff. If we take a look at the reality of journalism today, one of the greatest challenges for independent journalism is probably the subject of the Internet, in other words, the ability to access information on the Internet free of charge without knowing whether this information is correct or incorrect. That is a major challenge. In order to maintain high quality journalism, which we need to ensure, even in the age of the Internet, we must uphold the copyright of the journalists who supply high quality work. This is a key challenge for the future. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, different types of fruit take differing amounts of time to ripen. I can say on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) that our fruit is ripe for decision making and, therefore, we would like to vote on the Gallo report and come to a decision on it this week.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, in its session today, the Commission approved the new SWIFT agreement, and did so by a large majority or even unanimously. I would like to ask the President of the Commission – since I am sure he is aware that many of our citizens are concerned about data being passed on – where he sees substantial progress and how we can convince our citizens of the necessity of this agreement. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I just have a brief supplementary question. It concerns the content of the agreement that you have presented. I would like to repeat my previous question. What are the implications of this agreement for transatlantic relations? How important is it for the other topics that we need to discuss with the US? If you could give us an idea of this, I would be very grateful. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).  
– (DE) 
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr López Garrido, I too would firstly like to make a short comparison with the SWIFT debate. I was quite delighted to hear the representative of the Council talk of dedicated objectives in negotiations for this new SWIFT agreement. I am therefore quite surprised by the sort of effect and power the Treaty of Lisbon and the statement by Parliament have had on the Council, which now wants to champion the interests of Europe. I hope that we experience the same momentum now when we are talking about Passenger Name Record data, and that here there is also a commitment to fighting on behalf of European interests. Secondly, I would like to say that I believe we all agree that from the point of view of legal certainty for both airlines and citizens, when it is a question of data protection rights, such agreements make sense. The standards that we want have been set out clearly in the joint resolution. Thirdly, I would like to mention a point that is not directly connected with the agreements, but definitely relates to the subject, in other words, the debate in the Council as to whether we also need or should develop a European PNR system. The last major terror threat in Europe was the Detroit case when an attacker boarded a plane and wanted to fly to Detroit. That happened last year before Christmas. In this case, we learned that in the United Kingdom, we knew that this person was a threat. However, those who decided whether he could fly or not did not have the necessary information to hand. What I want to say here is that I believe that in the European Union, the problem is not whether there is enough data available. I believe that we already know who poses a threat. The problem is getting the data to where we need it in order to prevent threats. In Toledo, the Spanish Presidency proposed – and I am grateful for this – that we strengthen the networking of counter terrorism authorities in Europe. Unfortunately, this proposal was not taken up by the European interior ministers. Instead, there was the proposal to build new data sets and gather new data. It often seems to me that for the interior ministers, collecting new data is the easy option. I would firstly ask you to attend to the networking of the authorities involved; then we would achieve a lot in the fight against terror. Manfred Weber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schulz said that Greece has delivered and that it is now Europe’s turn. I wonder whether Europe actually needs to say ‘thank you’, nowadays, if Member States in the euro area simply keep to the rules, in other words, if they manage to get back to the 3% criterion. I also wonder what the difference was last year when Ireland faced the same situation and instituted hard cuts. Nobody came forward at that time with the idea of calling on a European Monetary Fund. Mr Verhofstadt says that speculators are at work. Clearly there is pressure in that regard at the moment, but the fact is that Greece enjoyed major rate advantages thanks to being in the euro area. Our Italian colleagues used the rate advantage they gained from their accession to the euro area to consolidate. Greece consumed it. We can indeed therefore say that the good European today is not the one who is putting his or her money on the table; the good European is the one who actually implements the rules that everyone has signed up to and accepted, so that they are actually complied with in the European Union. As a second point, I would like to give my backing to the Commission because the proposals that are on the table for the long-term future represent a move in the right direction. We have agreed the 3% and we therefore need a strong Commission that will, in future, monitor and also enforce that 3% limit. We have seen how the Member States in the euro area are unable to police each other and to observe the 3% limit on their own. That is why I am in favour of a strong Commission that will be able, in future, to see that the criteria are met. I have one more thought. We should talk positively about the euro. It is not a currency crisis that we have; it is an economic crisis. The euro is a major benefit for everyone. If our leaders in the European Union no longer say that, if that point is no longer made in the Council, people will not know it. That is why I am in favour of this major, strong currency. Manfred Weber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, that is very helpful. Thank you very much for making this possible. If I have understood things correctly, because this is a sensitive issue that we are discussing, then Mr Rubalcaba cannot assure us that the existing agreement will not come into force. In other words, if we postpone matters and give ourselves more time, it will come into effect. Therefore, my next question is: Can Mr Rubalcaba assure us that, for example, a long-term agreement will be in place within a month with higher standards or is the Council telling us that we must still wait nine months until the end of the period? It is very hard for Parliament to accept an unconditional assurance. Therefore, we must have clear conditions relating to the Council’s assurance, in order to be able to decide tomorrow about a possible postponement. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mr Rubalcaba, Commissioners, I am pleased that we are not only talking about SWIFT and body scanners today, but also having a general debate on the war on terror, because this is a subject that affects us all. Looking back, we have to say that terrorism is a real threat to the people of Europe. We are taking positive action and I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the public authorities. The people who are responsible for security have done a good job over recent years. I would also like to thank our partners. Now we must look to the future. What will we be faced with over the next few years? In this respect, I have three specific requests or proposals. The first concerns cooperation among the authorities in Europe. Every document comes with a headline emphasising the importance of collaborating and strengthening our cooperation. These are wonderful words, but nothing has happened in practice. Once again nothing happened in Toledo with regard to practical cooperation. There is no lack of action – this has been made clear in Detroit. What we are lacking is cooperation between the authorities. That is where the problem lies. Therefore, I would like to ask the Council finally to do its job in this area and to call on the Commission to put some appropriate proposals on the table. My second point is that we should investigate our existing legislation with regard to the collection of data and mobile phone data, for example, in the case of the retention of data. For this reason, you have the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for this evaluation. After an interval of a few years, it is important to put it to the test. Thirdly, we have just had a discussion about SWIFT. I would like to ask the House why our cooperation with the United States has to be organised in this way. It has to be organised like this because we Europeans are not in the position to evaluate the data ourselves. Therefore, the question arises as to whether we are self-confident enough to evaluate it ourselves. This is another thought for the future. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr López Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, this whole debate was, of course, initially coloured by the frustration and irritation that many people in the European Parliament felt because we had the impression that, once again, things were being rushed through in the Council before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. For that reason, I am now thankful that the Council has realised that it is good to consult Parliament, to now apply the new Treaty of Lisbon in the ratification process and also to give us the opportunity to assess whether this agreement is to be applied or not. In this legislative process, if we now start it, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will apply clear decision-making criteria. There are two sides to the coin. On one side, we as the PPE Group hold the clear principle that for European data – wherever this is stored – European data protection standards should apply. We hold the principle that we want a right of appeal for people who feel they have been unfairly treated in being subjected to data checks. We hold the basic principle that data should be passed on only in individual cases and only if the person is suspected of something, not simply as a general rule. These are things that we regard as important. On the other side of the coin, there is the fact that we, of course, want cooperation with the United States. We want to cooperate with our partners in the fight against terror. We do not want a situation in which individual states – if agreements expire – are put under particular pressure, like Belgium for example, because then states might start to operate on a bilateral basis. Careful consideration is also needed here. As the PPE Group, we will give consideration to this when the legislative proposal is presented. I would ask the Council and the Commission once again not to play for time, but to send the text now so that we can deal with it. As Parliament, we are capable of working quickly and we will be able to deal with this quickly. Then it will be up to the ministers – and just to make this very clear: the interior ministers – to convince Parliament that these methods that are now being proposed in this agreement really are necessary for the fight against terror. We are open to this process, but the task of convincing us is still to be done by the executive, in other words the ministers. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).  
– (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to look at the procedural argument. I would like to remind everyone that we have just voted on the Cashman report. This is a report created by Parliament in the course of an ongoing legislative procedure. Our Legal Service has stated that this is not permitted, but the socialists insisted on introducing it. While we were discussing the freedom of the press in Italy and the Commissioner responsible explained that the European Union has no authority in this area, the socialists still felt that it was worthwhile to attack Berlusconi. Whenever it suits the socialists, it is a question of there being no authority. Whenever other people are being opposed, the authority is in place. For this reason, we should not give in to them. However, the second argument is worthy of serious discussion. Are we responsible for the Convention on Human Rights? I would like to remind my fellow Members that, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union will become party to the Convention on Human Rights. This means that if it is legitimate for the Italian Parliament to discuss this, because Italy is party to the Convention on Human Rights, then it is also legitimate for the European Parliament to discuss this, as it will be party to the Convention on Human Rights in future. My third and final argument concerns the fact that we are not lawyers, we are politicians. This judgment affects millions of people and, therefore, we should vote on it today. (Applause) Manfred Weber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, I am grateful for the opportunity to hold this debate. Mr López Aguilar referred to the fact that in his opinion, as a lawyer, we are not responsible. I am not speaking as a lawyer, but as a politician. Millions of people in Europe are affected by this judgment by the judges in Strasbourg. This is why it is a good thing that we are discussing it here. The relationship between church and state in Europe has always been disputed and has led to bloody conflicts. It is right and proper that the European Union has managed to separate the state from religion. This is a good thing. However, we have a wide range of different models in Europe. France is clearly a non-religious state, while in Great Britain, the Head of State, the Queen, is also the head of the church. We have different models of how the relationship between church and state has developed. For this reason, I believe it is a good thing that we are calling for subsidiarity in this area and that every country can go its own way. I would even like to take things a step further. I do not want to talk about subsidiarity, but about the basic issue that, from my perspective, the European values of solidarity, subsidiarity and freedom are unthinkable without a foundation in Christianity and in the Judaeo-Christian understanding of religion. Why do we not find these values in China or in the Middle East? This is because they are based on our culture and our religions. It is possible to mention this without forcing anyone to accept the same faith. We are proud of our religious freedom. There is religious freedom in the sense that it is possible for me to decide to be an atheist. That is acceptable and legitimate and we have fought for this. However, there is also the right to have a faith. In my region, where more than one million people live, over 80% are Catholics. Just as atheists call for others to show them tolerance, so the Catholics who make up more than 80% of the population are calling for non-believers to be tolerant of their faith. They want to be able to show their faith in public, to represent it and to have Christian symbols accepted by the minority in this majority society. This is also legitimate in terms of religious freedom. Anyone who calls for tolerance must also show tolerance to those who practise a Christian faith. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, I have been here in the European Parliament for 5 years now, and I work in the field of internal affairs and the law. Today, therefore, is a day of joy for me, when we have the opportunity to debate the programmes for the next five years, when we will be able to deliberate on this future as a European Parliament on an equal legislative footing. We are discussing a dossier, a subject area, that exercises the public, where the public expect answers from us, where they even say that this is an area where we need more Europe. That is not so for every subject area, but in this case it is. They are making demands of us. They want answers from us. I therefore want to very briefly describe the change that will result from the new working basis and these subjects. The first point is working with the Council. We always have representatives of the Council here and they always tell us, as Presidents-in-Office of the Council, that Parliament is very important and that we must work together. When they leave that role, however, that understanding often crumbles away. It will be our job, as parliamentarians, to demand of the Council that it no longer allow this understanding to slip away, or for it – as with the SWIFT agreement, for example – to create precedents, despite not involving us here in Parliament in the approval process. That cannot, and in future, will not, be the situation any longer. It was a bad example of the institutions taking each other seriously. My second point is that we must be creators of ideas. The new treaty gives us the opportunity to table legislative initiatives. If we want to strengthen Frontex, we cannot just call for things to happen and just make proposals, we must also put legislation on the table. In future, we will have the opportunity to do that. My third point is that we also need to be a serious partner, one that does not just draw up wish lists. If, for example, we are dealing with the fight against illegal migration, we must not just take on NGO positions, we must be a serious partner. Finally, the European Parliament must take subsidiarity seriously. If we have competence, we must also consider which subject areas would be better dealt with at the national or regional level. These are four subjects that I think are important for the forthcoming few years. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would have liked the proposals for the Stockholm Programme to have been much more ambitious still, but today is a day to rejoice that we are entering this new phase, and all that remains to be said is let us get on with the work! Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group. 
– (DE) 
Mr President, I should like to support and speak in favour of the motion. Not every issue in Europe is an issue for Europe. We practise subsidiarity and we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) have confidence in our colleagues in the parliament in Rome and trust in the Roman courts, in the Italian courts, which can rule independently on what is good for Italy and what is not good for Italy. The Italian parliament has just proven that it is independent. We are happy to debate freedom of opinion, but then we should also debate freedom of opinion in the European Union. That must be clear in the motion and its title, which is why we are asking for support for our motion. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of Mr Mauro’s persuasive speech, suddenly even Mr Schulz has conceded that it would be a good thing for us to talk about Europe as a whole now. Alas, the title of today’s debate is Italy. I can absolutely see why many of you have no interest in talking about Europe as a whole. If, for example, I were to look at the media interests of Germany’s Social Democrats, I would observe that they own 90% of the newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau
 and that the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) owns 57% of the Neue Westfälische
 newspaper and holds an interest in the WAZ media group. The largest source of income for the SPD today is its media interests. I can therefore absolutely see why many of you have no interest in talking about ownership in other cases, but instead only want to discuss Italy. This debate is fizzling out because of the situation in Italy and the positive statements that we are hearing. I am not Italian, as you can tell when I speak, but the most convincing argument that comes to my mind is the question of what was the matter between 2006 and 2008 when Italy had a leftist government and, of course, at that time – as Mr Mauro has pointed out – everything was fine and dandy. There were no legislative proposals tabled by the then government to finally end the concentration of the media, though the power was there. Today, when there is once again a clear majority for the conservative parties in Italy, there are suddenly problems again. This debate must not give way to dishonesty. As long as the socialists, the leftists in this House, no longer have arguments to back us into a corner, I can very happily carry on with this debate! Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Western Balkans need Europe and we Europeans need stability in the Western Balkans. The Western Balkans are a central part of Europe and we must do our utmost to bring this important part back home to Europe. For that reason, these are the right proposals. The reality of life in this area has been described; the depressingly long queues at visa offices, the young people with no prospect of making an application to leave the country and get a taste of life in Europe. A lot of people experience this area as a prison, where they have no contact with the outside world. We all want to put an end to this and, in my group, Mrs Pack, Mrs Bildt and Mr Posselt are working on this with a great deal of dedication. We all stand for this. What worries us is that, as a result of the different treatment of the states in this area, there will be separatist movements and different classes of citizens in the area of the Western Balkans will be created, which could certainly lead to problems. However, the citizens in the European Union equally expect security. That means that the standards that Commissioner Barrot described here today, namely security standards for police cooperation, in the fight against illegal immigration and economic migration and for biometric data, are the agreed minimum standards which represent the rules of play. Our citizens expect those rules of play to be adhered to. That brings me to my second point: there must be no foreign policy concessions on the question of visa waiver. We should not give these states a free rein. The rules of play are clear and anyone who abides by them has every chance of having visas waived. The pressure on the states which have been unable to improve their standards hitherto, despite EU aid, should not let up. These are the two flanks that we in the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) consider to be right. We trust in the evaluation that the European Commission has carried out and can therefore approve the present step. Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, during this debate many people have expressed their gratitude to the Czech Presidency for the fact that it has still managed to complete a few projects, in administrative terms, by the end of its term of office. I ask myself in all seriousness: have we really become so modest in our expectations? We are in the business of politics. What we actually expect, in the greatest economic crisis for decades which is combined with environmental challenges, is a Presidency which shows leadership and vision. That is what we really expect. We have seen that the administrative work has been completed for what is still on the table at end of the term of office. I really would have expected more. Prime Minister, if you meet with President Klaus this evening, please tell him that had an opportunity during these six months to make the Czech national identity and sovereignty clear to Europe by showing strong leadership. He did of course promote the importance of national sovereignty here in Parliament. Unfortunately, he missed the opportunity. Markus Ferber,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that, through today’s debate on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments, we have advanced into the core area for financial market regulation within this legislative period; now we need to regulate the financial markets and not just look at individual products, as we did in the past. I just want to pick out a few key terms. In the last year we have not made life easy for ourselves. We have conducted a hearing in committee, we have surveyed all the stakeholders and every interested group, and on this basis, through various processes, working documents and the like, produced a result which we are setting before this plenary session here today and tomorrow. I will take a few points from it. Firstly, market structure. On the one hand, we must concede that in recent years something has happened in the financial markets which has made it in Parliament’s interest that each trade in securities takes place under the MiFID rules, which is why we have approved a new category – bounded by many conditions – called Organised Trading Facilities, where only non-equities can be traded, where proprietary trading is forbidden and where, with regard to execution, transaction and customer interaction, execution may take place at the operator’s discretion. Through this process I think that we are making an important contribution to ensuring that the entire area of traded OTC papers is handled within the MiFID environment. Another major subject not considered in the last MiFID is algorithmic or high-frequency trading. Once again, we needed to issue clear rules here, so that these areas, which can be very dangerous and can be manipulatively employed, is subject to a strict system with minimum holding periods, trade interruption opportunities, the option to test algorithms, the option of examining algorithms within the supervisory structure, the introduction of tick-size regimes, a minimum price, and corresponding fee systems.  Another subject I would like to touch on is the area of commodities futures markets. I do believe that we have a particular responsibility here, when it comes to restricting the speculative part of commodities futures markets, not to contribute through bad regulation to a situation where people in the third and fourth worlds can no longer buy food. Because of this, we have chosen a two-pronged approach with the aim of curbing speculation but not thereby damaging the real economy. We want to achieve this by using position limits with strict ceilings on the number of contracts or positions. We also want to ensure, by means of the position-check system, that those who can prove that they really need a product do not suddenly speculate in this market. Another issue that concerns us is the area of investor protection. I would like to point out here that we have chosen a very broad approach in guaranteeing protection for consumers and investors. This means that the requirements of specific customer groups need to be identified. Not every small saver needs access to highly complex papers. What is needed is to define the relevant products for target groups, carry out product testing, make telephone recordings, give relevant advice, disclosure requirements, but – I want to briefly mention – to proceed, with regard to commissions, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. Member States should be able, according to their structures, to make relevant accommodations. I think we are on the right track here. My time is running out, so I thank everyone who has been involved. I think it is a shame that we only have four minutes’ speaking time for such a complex report. I thank all my colleagues who collaborated on this and the Commission for the very constructive role it has played in recent weeks and months. I hope that a strong vote in the plenary session tomorrow will put us in a situation to negotiate with the Council in order to resolve this important report as soon as possible. Markus Ferber,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief. Firstly, I am pleased that I have such wide support, from the extreme left to the extreme right. I do not know whether this is a good thing – but perhaps it is helpful to have found a compromise in the middle.  Secondly, I want to point out here that we are talking about financial market regulation. Therefore, it depends on which markets trading takes place on. Trading in financial products always involves risk: there is no such thing as a risk-free financial market. If you demonise financial markets per se, you will be unhappy with any regulation. This was not our intention. It was our intention, on the one hand, to ensure that every trade in financial products takes place within a regulated framework and, on the other hand, that these financial markets generate added value for the economy and do not exist purely for their own sake. If we have anything to learn from the time before 2008 it is that financial markets acted independently and did not generate any added value for the real economy – this has been the painful experience of recent years. As a result, we have produced something together. My heartfelt thanks, therefore, go to all the shadow rapporteurs who collaborated on this report. We will have the privilege of holding meetings with the Council over the coming months in order to produce a good result. I hope that we can take the good spirit we have maintained in discussions over almost a year into those negotiations. Markus Ferber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is important that we as the European Parliament grapple very hard with the European Semester – after all, we introduced it when we negotiated the ‘six-pack’. Why? I believe that we in Europe have not been suffering from formulating the rules of the game together but rather we are suffering from the fact that, in the end, the rules are not being applied as they were formulated at the European level. Parliament ought to lead this process very strongly and also to continue to touch on the sore points where things are not working as agreed.  I think that the report before us – for which I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, in particular – provides an important indicator of what can be improved in the interaction between Member States, national parliaments, the European Parliament, the Commission, which must oversee the whole procedure, and the processes that then take place in the Member States. We must now cooperate to use all the euphoria, the spirit of optimism – that is right, we want to make things better for the future – and this momentum, if we want Europe to learn lasting lessons from the financial, economic and national debt crisis. There are many, many important contributions here, both in the individual reports from the Commission to the Member States and in the work we at Parliament have produced.  Many thanks to the rapporteur for this. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) emphatically supports this report. However, over the coming weeks, months and years we will ensure not only that many documents are written but that policy is implemented in the interests of European citizens and taxpayers. Markus Ferber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should concentrate on today’s subject, and forget about things that are off topic. What are we discussing today? We are discussing how we want to bring Parliament and the Member States together in order to establish strict ground rules that will not go the way of all things European, which is to say that, while they may be adopted here, when it comes to application, they no longer play a major role, as we have already experienced in many, many cases – not only with the euro, but elsewhere, too. We want to establish ground rules that really oblige the Member States to do things that are urgently necessary, in order to guarantee that which states were originally created to provide, namely, guaranteeing infrastructure, education, employment, social security and many other things for the people, although not at the expense of future generations or other Member States. We should therefore not do the other thing proposed in numerous amendments, which is to say, we should not accompany this obligation with the development of any new sources of funding that have only one purpose, namely, to reward those who have not kept to the rules hitherto and punish those who have. A Europe on that basis will not work in the long term. Europe will only work if everyone adheres to the ground rules agreed. The idea of a debt redemption fund must therefore be rejected. Such a fund punishes those who kept their houses in order, to the benefit of those who did not. The idea of eurobonds must therefore be rejected. Such bonds punish those who acted properly and adhered to the rules and reward those who did not. These sections should therefore be rejected. Markus Ferber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with all the problems relating to the details that we could talk about, and which we will be talking about, in the further legislative procedure, we should not lose sight of one thing: financial markets cannot function according to a model in which, when everything is going well, the banks take the profits, and then, when something goes wrong, taxpayers have to pick up the tab. That is why it makes sense for there also to be a tax on financial transactions. It also makes sense for this to be done in a cross-border arrangement. In Europe – or at least in the euro area – this would not result in distortions; rather, it would make a lasting contribution to bringing about a stable financial market which generates what financial markets are actually there for, namely, to provide enterprises with access to capital, to allow savers to save or put something aside for their old age, and so that the financial markets can once again do the job for which they were once created, which is to provide added value for the real economy. Everything that drove us into the financial crisis consisted of products that added no value for the real economy. That is why it makes sense to have a tax that can be used to help ensure that this is severely penalised, that sanctions are taken, that steers us towards a situation in which capital goes back to doing its job. That is why I am advocating that we adopt this proposal today with a broad majority. Markus Ferber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must put an end to a few of the fairytales that are often told here. Fairytale number 1: austerity policies are cold and heartless and push people into social exclusion. That is not true. Austerity policies involve creating opportunities, so that future generations have the chance to do the jobs that they need to do. While the policy in some areas is sustainable, what has repeatedly been said here about financial policy is not sustainable at all. Fairytale number 2: eurobonds are the solution to all our problems. In fact, eurobonds are a sweet-tasting poison. They provide those people with money under favourable terms who can no longer obtain it elsewhere under favourable terms, so that they can run up even more debts. This is why we must categorically reject eurobonds. Fairytale number 3: all our problems will be solved by a debt redemption fund. Just to make it clear what we are talking about, a debt redemption fund means that the Member States generate surpluses per se
, so that they can make use of the fund. During the repayment period, they cannot accumulate any new debts, otherwise the whole system will cease to function. We need to look more closely at the truth and the reality before we start calling for model solutions. For this reason, the only possibility for offering people lasting future prospects and for defending the European social model on an ongoing basis in competition with other economic areas is to increase our competitiveness. We will not do this by relying more heavily on the state. Instead, we need to give companies the opportunity to invest money, for example, by selling building plots where people know that what they build on the plot will belong to them, as an illustration of the problem in Greece, and where they know that the state will not constantly be intervening with non-tariff trade barriers to limit their growth, as an illustration of the problem in France. We can only increase our competitiveness by overcoming the challenges on global markets and Germany is a good example of this. Markus Ferber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should stop acting as if we can save the world every time we get together in Strasbourg. Once again, we have a proposal on the table, and once again we are saving the world, the climate, our resources and who knows what else – even though we have already done it before elsewhere. It makes no sense to do the same thing over and over again. That is why I want to state very clearly that it makes no sense – as the Commissioner has said – to burden aviation, where we have a functioning emissions certificate trading system that we hope will also soon be effective internationally, with an additional tax. It makes no sense to include shipping, which has ideal alternative options, in this tax. It makes no sense to engineer a compromise between energy density and CO2
 emissions. Excuse me for saying so, but as an engineer, I must point out that high energy density means lower CO2 
emissions per kilometre travelled. Penalising this correlation twice is equally non-sensical. I therefore have to say that the Commission proposal has not been fully thought out. What the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs approved by a majority – against the wishes of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – only makes a half-baked proposal worse still. There is not the slightest chance that unanimity will be achieved in the Council of Ministers. That is why we need to be honest here in the European Parliament and say that we reject the report. We need to throw out this proposal. It is half-baked, unusable, and there are better ways of saving the world than through tax legislation. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Mr Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, once again, the Heads of State or Government are meeting to discuss growth, employment and competitiveness and to exchange papers on these subjects without actually taking any action. I can remember papers on the topic of youth unemployment at the end of the 1990s which identified that some Member States had lower levels of youth unemployment and others had higher levels, and which explained that it would be a good idea to look at what those countries with low rates were doing. Fourteen years have now passed and nothing has happened. When people say that we need to show solidarity, I would like to remind them that in the last 31 years, Greece has received more than EUR 100 billion from the Structural Funds. That is an expression of European solidarity. It has repeatedly been said that the money can be used, for example, to fund education and training, in particular for young people. I can remember initiatives in the region which I come from that involved attempts to introduce the dual educational system in different areas of Greece. However, this did not work. The energy revolution is still in progress in Greece and this and many other things could be financed using money from the Structural Funds. This demonstrates Europe’s solidarity. However, we also need to increase the pressure to ensure that the funds made available by the European Union are used for the purposes which will be discussed during the spring summit. Otherwise, this will once again be a summit with lots of interesting papers but no concrete results. Markus Ferber  (PPE
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Ferreira, I specifically referred to the European Union Structural Funds. However, I would like to ask for understanding on this point. If this funding had been spent in the same way as the Federal Republic of Germany used the money from the Marshall Plan, you would not need a rescue package today. Markus Ferber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to be a little bit more honest again in this debate. What was the situation like before the euro was introduced? What were the interest rates like in Greece when it still had the drachma? What were the rates in Italy when it had the lira, or in Spain with the peseta and Portugal with the escudo? They were considerably higher than what has to be paid on the financial markets at the moment. Those Member States within the euro enjoyed the sweet poison of low interest rates for a decade, and pursued a spending policy that they are no longer on top of. For them to now say that they want to continue to enjoy that sweet poison via the introduction of Eurobonds is precisely the wrong reaction to have. Many mistakes were made here in the past that now need to be corrected. Anyone who believes that this problem would be solved by making the drug that is low interest rates available on a sustained basis would be taking away the pressure that, thank goodness, is currently being applied to a number of Member States by the financial markets. As a second issue, I would point out that Europe would not be made healthy where the result of Eurobonds would be not to make the sick healthy, but to make the healthy sick. That is why we need to be honest on this issue, too. Eurobonds would not strengthen the European Union, they would weaken it. Then we have the craziest proposal of all in this resolution, namely to engineer a kind of self-funding reduction of debts through new debts via a redemption fund. What world are we living in? In real terms, what that means is that the debts that countries have run up would be refinanced thanks to the creditworthiness of others, with the costs being borne by those who kept their finances in order in that they have to pay higher interest rates for those who failed to do likewise. That is the communitarisation of debts. Anyone introducing this as a policy instrument endangers Europe much, much more than what we have currently put in place in connection with the rescue packages. I can therefore but warn against acting as if Eurobonds would enable us to solve all our problems. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Markus Ferber  (PPE

 Ms Goulard, I will just say, briefly, that that is not a judgment that I have put forward here. I would just point out that the last government bonds issued by Italy before it joined the euro bore an interest rate of 10%. There was no outcry in Italy at the time. Nobody said that other countries should take on the debt. It was natural for Italy to pay high interest rates. Yet now, all of a sudden, because we have had low interest rates for 10 years and got up to our ears in debt, because money was cheap – for investments just as for the public purse – we want to prolong that through Eurobonds. That represents a trap from which we will not escape, and I stand by what I said. Markus Ferber,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to join in thanking our rapporteur and all those who worked on the report because this is certainly not a routine task, even if this is the fortieth time we have dealt with competition policy on the basis of a report from the Commission. I would like to thank the Commissioner for his very comprehensive presentation – 2010 was, of course, the first year in which you had full responsibility for competition policy. Turning to something you mentioned yourself, I would like to ask that some practices in the area of public aid in the banking sector should be eradicated because the new stress tests required by the European banking supervision system indicate a need for further recapitalisation for the banks. I do not believe that it will contribute anything to the stability of the banking system if we still have a large number of unresolved or outstanding old cases on the one hand, while new cases are being created on the other because pressure is increasing to raise the equity capital quota accordingly, particularly in the area of private banks. Hence my urgent plea to you, Commissioner, to find a swift solution that will help stabilise the banking sector so that it can withstand the challenges of the international environment. The second major issue, the control of mergers, will continue to concern us increasingly in the years ahead. Here, too, I can only urge you to continue on the clear and transparent path taken by the Commission to date within the framework of merger control. It is in the interests of all involved, particularly the consumer, that we should ensure that competition is possible in the area of merger control, whether in larger or other structures, which is not for me to judge. With this in mind, I would like to thank all those who have been involved. I hope, Commissioner, that we will find a solution soon, particularly in the banking sector. Markus Ferber  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I can only agree with all of those who have congratulated the Council Presidency. Not only were you an honest broker during a difficult time; you were also a European broker. That was very nice to see during these difficult times in which we are seeing political trends in a number of Member States that suggest to the people that it would be possible to achieve more alone than together. You focused on what unites us. It was also very refreshing to see that, with this clear European agenda, you also received the support of the people in Poland on domestic policy matters. That was not particularly easy in this context. Therefore, I have the highest respect for what you have achieved. In this six-month period, we were also able to get a few things under way in the area of financial market regulation. Allow me to highlight just one area in which I was able to join in the negotiations myself, namely, the question of the regulation of short selling and naked credit default swaps in connection with government bonds, where the Commission did not have the confidence to propose a stringent regulation and with regard to which all the Member States said that we would not succeed, and where, thanks to the Polish Presidency, we did succeed in imposing sanctions against a highly speculative instrument and, where necessary, prohibiting it, so that we could help to bring greater stability to the financial markets. I would particularly like to thank your Finance Minister and the Secretary of State, who got this off the ground during a difficult discussion process between Parliament and the Council. That is an example that shows that we can do something together in the interests of security and stability in Europe. I would like to express my sincere thanks for that. Markus Ferber  (PPE

– (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Dowgielewicz, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, we ought to focus once again on our task here today. I have now listened to eight speakers and eight different solutions. That demonstrates the problem that we have here in this House. I am, of course, pleased that there is a more united approach in the Council and that things can be brought together more quickly than the many proposals that we have now heard from the various political groups. If we need to be clear about one thing, however, then it is that we need to make immediate and united efforts to put in order what the Member States have so far prevented us from sorting out. It was easy for the US to establish a European regulation because the country already had institutions at a Federal level. We needed jointly to establish these first, and we have done that together as Parliament, even in the face of opposition, for example, from the United Kingdom. By tightening up the Stability and Growth Pact with the Governance Package, we have shown that we are capable of action here and are able to strengthen Europe to enable it to function. However, Mr Barroso, I also have a very strong point of criticism: we cannot now talk about accelerated procedures if we still have no proposals from the Commission for the majority of the necessary regulations. We are waiting for the regulation of financial markets and the Market Abuse Directive to name but two, which will probably not be tabled until next week. We cannot adopt something that is not even on the table! Therefore, my sincere request is for the Commission to press forward with these matters. All of this was intended to be done in the first half of this year. It is now October! You cannot accuse Parliament of not doing its job. We are genuinely doing everything possible to find appropriate solutions. Therefore, please table the proposals and then we will adopt them. Markus Ferber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add my thanks for the clear affirmation you have given to the European project, Mr Tusk. I believe that now, in the 21st century, it makes sense to make a concerted effort to address problems that one country cannot resolve on its own and to find a good solution in the interest of our citizens. Thank you very much for your clear expression of commitment in this area. The tasks facing you in the second half of 2011 are enormous. The key one has already been mentioned, namely, the Greek rescue. I believe that it is right and proper that the European Union should take the lead here, rather than allowing the credit rating agencies to set the pace and direction for our actions. We shall also have to adjust our internal mechanisms if we are to remain capable of action and ensure stability. Unfortunately, Mr Farage has left us, but I would appreciate it if continuous attacks on our common currency from within the European Union would stop, even from those who are not part of the currency union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to answer this question. If we continue with this debate for the next few years, then the Americans will decide on the world’s environmental protection, the Chinese will dictate consumer protection and Europeans will have no protections whatsoever. Our job is to work for the people. (Applause)
 I wanted to briefly point out that we also have a number of problems to resolve in the area of the regulation of the financial markets, both in terms of the governance package and in relation to financial services. I look forward to working with you and hope that we Europeans can play a significant role in stabilising the financial markets. We have a particular duty in this regard and I am optimistic that we will succeed admirably under the Polish Presidency. Markus Ferber,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is right for us to debate this important proposal from the Commission here in plenary today and for us to lay down our position as the European Parliament tomorrow, because discussions in recent weeks – with all respect to the Hungarian Presidency, which has tried very hard to bring the Council and Parliament closer together on this – have shown that the Council of Ministers still needs to be motivated into adopting rules that allow what is necessary, but which prohibit what is not necessary. Let me say quite plainly that I can hardly stand to hear the word liquidity any more. If there was one problem that was to blame for leading us into the financial crisis, it was that there was too much liquidity that was invested in products that nobody needs and which then collapsed and took us into the crisis. I ask you therefore: who is it that needs insurance against a government defaulting on its commitments? Only those that hold such government securities, and they should indeed have it. Anyone speculating on a country being unable to meet its commitments, however, should not be able to use such instruments to do so. That is why these products must be prohibited. When it comes to the short selling of shares – in other words, selling shares that one does not have – it is a matter of drawing up rules that prevent highly speculative behaviour. I believe we have achieved a reasonable compromise here, and in this respect discussions with the Council have been very constructive. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding work. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive discussions, and also the Commission, which has played a very positive part in achieving this. Moreover, I hope that, for its part, the Council – which is unfortunately not represented here today – will be able to agree a sensible resolution of this matter with us as soon as possible. With that in mind, I am pleased that we – as Parliament – are now sending out a clear signal as regards this important dossier. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is actually about innovative financing, but we have already heard something about that. Innovation does not simply mean inventing new taxes or re-labelling what has always been there, such as national debt. I would like to concentrate very briefly on what this debate is really about. It is not about the introduction of Eurobonds – and the CDU/CSU parties will certainly speak out against that – but rather it is about learning the lessons of the crisis in the financial markets, and that means quite simply that speculation must be taxed too. It also means – and I will state this quite clearly – that if this cannot be done worldwide at the G20, then we must do it at European Union level. There is no alternative; that is why I am not simply looking for applause now, Mr Bullmann, but for a clear, strong vote by the European Parliament tomorrow. In this, Commissioner, the Commission must act as our ally against the Member States – particularly against the Member State that we have just heard speaking so loudly about what the City of London thinks. I will simply say to you, Mr Farage: look at the unemployment figures and look at the economic decline of your country, which has concentrated on financial market products. If you still built cars – as we do in Bavaria and in Germany – then you would be doing somewhat better now. That is why the financial transaction tax must be called for and introduced now as a matter of urgency. It is our duty as Europeans. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).

 Madam President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that today is a good day, not only for the European institutions, but also for the people of Europe, because we have succeeded, two years after the collapse of the Lehman bank, in creating a structure that, although not eliminating all of the problems that could arise in the financial market, will help to make the excesses that have occurred in the financial market no longer possible in the European Union. We can be proud of ourselves for this. I would like to express my thanks to the Belgian Presidency, because we had the feeling – and I can endorse what Mrs Goulard said – that the Council was not making much of an effort in this regard at the beginning. Although the Council adopted a unanimous resolution at first, it did not solve the problems. It was thanks to the European Parliament that a solution was found across the group divides which is truly viable and which will ensure that we have stable supervisory structures as well as a range of instruments that can be used in crisis situations to stem excesses and thus help to stabilise the financial sector. I would like to thank you most sincerely, Mr Reynders, as you have personally shown a great deal of commitment to this matter. However, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the Commission, which ensured that, in a fair dialogue, the two positions represented by the Council and Parliament, which were very far apart to start with, could be brought together. Thank you very much. That gives us hope with regard to further legislation. Markus Ferber,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the second and third Postal Services Directive, I am, of course, particularly pleased that this subject is also on the agenda during this parliamentary term, because I believe it is also important to show what we have achieved since we tabled the Green Paper in 1992, as the Commissioner mentioned. We have managed to significantly improve the quality of postal services throughout Europe. I can still remember that, two parliamentary terms ago, I said in this Chamber that it was usual for holidaymakers to arrive home before the postcards they had sent home to their loved ones. That situation has now changed. We have achieved a significant improvement in the quality of cross-border postal services. We have achieved a significant improvement in the quality of postal services within the Member States. With the obligation for a universal service that is uniform throughout Europe, we have also managed to significantly improve the availability of postal services, or in areas where it was already good, we were able to maintain this level. That is also important, and it was mentioned by both the Commissioner and our committee chair. Of course, in implementing the third directive, which for the majority of Member States specifies 1 January 2011 as the date for complete liberalisation, it is now important to safeguard this universal service on a permanent basis. I would like to emphasise what is stated in the question regarding the simultaneous requirement – and that was the Conditio sine qua non
 for the third directive – that it should not result in a deterioration in working conditions, but that existing social standards and protection mechanisms should continue to apply in the Member States beyond 1 January 2011. We will, of course, ensure that this is the case. We will not only have the oral question today, but the Commission also has obligations to provide us with reports. We will read these reports very carefully, Commissioner, and if necessary we will also formulate the appropriate conclusions. Markus Ferber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, one could wonder what we have actually now achieved after a year spent in discussions, debates and many sessions in the trialogue, and I could have certainly imagined doing something nicer than spending my time there. One year on from the European elections, when we announced in public how we wanted to bring the finance markets into line, we are now at a point where our success rate ranges from very little to none at all. The problem has already been explained. We are dealing with markets which operate globally nowadays. Member States still believe that they can use their national supervisory structures to apply rules in this environment. The fact that this did not work was not what actually triggered the financial crisis, but it contributed to Europe being affected by it as well. This is why I would ask when this realisation, which is often mentioned in grandiose speeches, will be converted into political action, where it is suddenly about protecting stock exchange centres and banking structures and no longer about protecting citizens. This is the task to which we have committed ourselves as the European Parliament. I hope that Member States will commit themselves to this task, too, because we share the responsibility for implementing proper supervision regulations for citizens, which will ensure that individuals’ savings are also permanently secure. I would of course hope – and I am now addressing the Commissioners – that every effort will now be made by the Commission so that we can achieve a good outcome as quickly as possible, for the benefit of people living in Europe. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is this all about then? The question is quite simply how can the financial markets help to reduce the costs that they have incurred for states, societies and the economy? That is the crucial question that we must answer. I think that together, we have developed a very balanced text. I am also very grateful to the Commissioner for the way he has worded it. On the one hand, we cannot pretend that Europe is the Island of the Blessed where we can do what we like without the global financial markets reacting to it. Things must be coordinated internationally. On the other hand, we must also ensure that the sector makes an appropriate contribution to overcoming the crisis. That is why I would caution that we must stop coming up with a new item every week that we can use to solve all the problems of the world. A couple of months ago, it was an additional levy on airline tickets that was going to solve all our problems, now it is the tax on financial transactions and next month, somebody will think of something else. That is going too far. It is a question of involving the financial markets in an internationally coordinated manner. If a sensible solution to this can be put forward by the Commission and introduced into international negotiations, then we will be on the right track. We should also be honest with ourselves. Those who maintain that we can stop speculation with such instruments are clearly deluding themselves. What we want is for speculators to make their contribution to the risk and to overcoming the risk. That is the right approach. In doing so, you have our full support Commissioner. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to begin with, it is right that common procedures should go with a common currency. It is right to consider how these common procedures, which have not yet been implemented everywhere in the Single Euro Payments Area, might be enforced a little better. On the other hand, I will say quite clearly that we still have to adapt the rulebook in a few places. I myself come from a country where the direct debit procedure is a very widespread procedure, in order to facilitate the processing of certain regular payments. The procedure that is currently planned in the rulebook is a very bureaucratic, very complicated procedure and therefore, I would be very pleased, Commissioner, if, with regard to a final date – something we all want – this area in particular is tackled once again. On the one hand, there should be no vulnerability to fraud – that is a problem in the cross-border area – but on the other hand, it should also be possible for local charges to be debited, and for any magazine subscription, any insurance premium, any mobile phone bill, and so on to continue to be collected in a simple procedure by the companies concerned. That is my request and there is also a corresponding passage in our motion for a resolution on this subject, so that we can contribute to ensuring that procedures that have proved successful in the Member States can also be guaranteed after the final introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area. Markus Ferber  (PPE

 Madam President, Commission President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, what is tomorrow’s vote all about? It is about doing what many people in this House cannot do and others do not want to do. It is, in fact, about taking responsibility for Europe. I would like to highlight one point. Mr Barroso, I am very grateful to you for mentioning this again in your interruption. It is about taking responsibility for Europe’s ability to act during a difficult time, in order to overcome all the problems which have been the subject of justified criticism from citizens and also from this Parliament. I believe that today’s debate has helped to clarify the issue of whom Europe can and cannot rely on in future when it comes to taking political responsibility in the years to come. However, I would like to point out, Mr Barroso, that there is, of course, a whole series of subjects on the agenda which need to be dealt with and you have a great deal of responsibility in this area because you have a monopoly on launching initiatives at a European level. I would like to look at one more subject which seems to me not to have been covered in sufficient detail in the debate so far and that is agricultural policy. In this area, we are faced with several new challenges. It is not enough simply to mention the fact that the agriculture ministers came to a resolution in the autumn of last year. It is not enough that we have begun a programme of comprehensive agricultural reform, because when the basic conditions change, you must, of course, take a corresponding initiative to help farmers in the European Union. My request is that you take the Commissioner for Agriculture on one side and point out to her that her model will not succeed in guiding this important sector out of the crisis. We are prepared, and I am speaking on behalf of my colleagues here, to take over responsibility for Europe in the interests of the European Union and the people of Europe. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Along with a large majority in Parliament, I have voted against the ACTA. Today it is a case of ACTA ad acta
. Tomorrow it will be a new start for increased market protection. In its current form, the ACTA was beset with too many errors and a lack of clarity. It confused people and resulted in a large amount of public pressure in the social networks and new media, the latter being something positive. I also still find it annoying that for years the ACTA was kept secret and was only made public at a late stage following intensive pressure from the European Parliament. We MEPs were expected to rubber stamp everything in a fast-track procedure. That is not acceptable. Many mistakes were made that we can only correct by making a completely new start. The clear ‘no’ to ACTA is, for me, an unqualified ‘yes’ to global protection against ‘commercial-scale counterfeiting and piracy’, which is actually the key concern of the agreement. Without effective, global coordination of copyright protection, Europe has a great deal to lose. Intellectual property is Europe’s most valuable raw material. Our decision today clears the way for the development of a new, better and transparent agreement under European leadership. This process can and must take place in dialogue with all ‘stakeholders’ – with the focus on people and ethics. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, there is a German rhyme: Ein kleines Dorf im Frankenland ist durch sein gutes Bier bekannt
, which tells of regional pride in a brewery, and this demonstrates a problem that we have created today. If this brewery or its distributor is 107 kilometres away from where I live, then in future, it will no longer be able to supply me with its products unless it buys a new tachograph and complies with new red tape. That is why I voted against this resolution today, because in my view, we should not be overburdening our small and medium-sized enterprises. There are many points that we have managed to incorporate which were positive. After all, it was planned that a radius of just 50 kilometres should be accepted for regional suppliers. The Commission was being quite absurd there. A distance of 100 kilometres may be just about feasible. However, what if the distance is more than this? I therefore consider it to be excessive. One final aspect: as a representative of an employees’ organisation in the German CSU party, I would also say that this regulation represents complete control of workers. Why? It is because the entire working day of those distributing construction materials or drinks from the breweries is completely controlled via GPS. For data protection reasons, too, therefore, I feel that what we have decided today is highly questionable, and I emphasise once again why I voted against it. Martin Kastler  (PPE

Madam President, I voted against the Ferreira report for a number of reasons. Reading our newspapers in Germany – only today, one of the big dailies says that the German chancellor is asking whether anybody still sticks to the rules in Europe, or they say that Cyprus is the next candidate for a bailout – I ask myself: ‘What next?’. Just as the previous speaker said that after the ‘six-pack’ comes the ‘two-pack’, I believe that after the ‘two-pack’ will come the ‘zero-pack’, because we no longer know how it is actually supposed to work. I am very concerned that we, the elected representatives, will be the last to find out the secret plan that the European Commission and the institutions have for how we carry on with Europe. I am firmly convinced that in the future, we will have to consider how we carry on at all. The mood among the population of my constituency is so bad that it is clear: we want to help, but we also want to have rules, and those rules should be adhered to and checked. I cannot therefore vote for further debt, for a Europe of debt, a transfer union, which is what we already have in many areas. I am against eurobonds. I am also against project bonds, because I do not think that they will help us to act usefully in this area in the future and make progress together. I hope, however, that at some point, the European institutions will tell us transparently and openly about this so-called secret plan, so that we find out what it involves. Martin Kastler,

 Mr President, Mr De Gucht, your statement was very informative. Thank you very much. Sometimes, figures say more than words. Up to this point, as you have mentioned, the European Patent Office has granted almost 2 000 patents for plants and almost 1 200 patents for animals created with and without the use of genetic engineering. I would like to mention two prominent examples. The first is the approval of patents on barley which has been genetically modified and modified by breeding. This applies to the entire chain from the seed through to the plant and, therefore, affects both our farmers and our brewers, both producers and consumers. This example shows the devastating scope of the patenting processes. The second example concerns the so-called long-life tomato, which is not to be confused with the long-life oil in the engines of your diesel cars. The ploy used by the applicant, the US company Arcadia, enabled it to obtain a patent by circumventing current EU regulations. It was not the tomato that was patented, but its genetic material, in this case, selected enzymes. This shows the lengths that companies will go to, despite the fact that, as you have said, Mr De Gucht, Article 4 of the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions of 1998 clearly states: The following shall not be patentable: (a) plant and animal varieties; (b) essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals. We are of the opinion that this definition should be made more precise. Technical processes used to support conventional breeding activities must not lead to patentability. We would like to make it quite clear that there must be no patents on life. We need to send out a clear signal that there needs to be a more ethical approach and greater honesty with regard to creation. I repeat: we are opposed to the patentability of life throughout Europe. Therefore, Mr De Gucht, we are calling for a clear statement from the Commission that patents on genetic material and genetic resources are, and will remain, banned. Secondly, we are calling for a clear position on Article 4 of the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions: no patents on life. Thirdly, Mr De Gucht, on behalf of many farmers and breeders in Europe, we are calling for the breeders’ and farmers’ privilege to be clearly enshrined in all legislation. Martin Kastler  (PPE
),

 Today, I have voted in favour of the resolution on the Statute for a European cooperative society with regard to the involvement of employees. It is good that we are focusing specifically on the subject of cooperatives in the European Parliament, as this is the International Year of Cooperatives. In the European Union, there are around 160 000 cooperatives, which are owned by more than a quarter of all Europeans and employ about 5.4 million people. In my home region of Bavaria alone, there are over 1 200 cooperatives and cooperative enterprises with more than 2.7 million members. Cooperatives are one of the cornerstones of our economy. Their achievements are even more obvious in times of crisis, because cooperatives involve taking joint responsibility. For example, during the financial crisis, cooperative banks demonstrated how sustainable and resilient they are as a result of their cooperative business model. They have not lost billions in the crisis like other banks. On the contrary, their balance sheets show an increase in revenue and growth. They provide 5.4 million high-quality, crisis-proof jobs throughout Europe. Cooperatives have their roots in the regions where they are located. They represent a model for the future, for our regions and for Europe. If we promote the cooperative model as part of EU development policy, we can make a contribution which will really help people, actively involve them and encourage them to be independent. We need more incentives for cooperatives. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I can only support what my colleague, Mr Posselt, has already said: Strasbourg is the capital of Europe, the seat of the European Parliament. I propose that we should close Brussels, that we stop shuttling back and forth between Brussels and Strasbourg, and that we finally invest here. We own the buildings here, but not the ones in Brussels. This is the seat of Parliament. I have to ask myself: we entertain so many visitors here in Strasbourg every month. We explain how Europe works to them. Why are we building a Parliamentarium, a museum of European history, in Brussels? That belongs here in Strasbourg. It is for this reason that I voted against this report. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I have voted against the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the feasibility of introducing stability bonds. The name has been changed, but the content remains the same. These are Eurobonds. We have now reached a stage in Europe where we need to ask ourselves the fundamental question of how Europe is to go forward. The Italian Prime Minister, Mr Monti, said today in a guest article in Germany that we need to ‘rethink democracy’. To this, I would add that we must ‘rethink Europe’. We must do this if we want to carry the citizens of Europe along with us. I believe that referendums are an important instrument. We need citizens to become increasingly involved in Europe, not only in the Member States, but also at a European level. This will enable us to discuss the major issues currently facing us which have led us into this crisis. It will take us further forward than simply tabling new motions for resolutions to distribute ever larger debts among ourselves. Every country is responsible for its own debts. We should not be transferring debts from one state to another. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me preface my remarks by saying that I am also greatly in favour of freedom of movement and I believe that it is a really important achievement for the European Union that we can move around this single market freely in the service sectors, indeed in all sectors. However, there is also a principle that applies not just within the European Union, but also under the rule of law, namely: pacta sunt servanda
 – treaties are to be honoured. According to the Treaty, a clause applies to the free movement of workers, setting down a period of three years, plus two years, plus two years. Accordingly, I was unable to support this resolution today, as it is just a symbol of a willingness to alter treaties while they are still in force. In my opinion, it should be up to the Member States themselves to decide. This is what it says in the Treaties. That was correct. Nonetheless, when the Treaties lapse and all restrictions run out, there will be no wave of mass migration to the old Member States from the other Member States. I am absolutely convinced that it is by working together that we will achieve progress in the European Union and that no more barriers should be imposed. Martin Kastler  (PPE

Madam President, I was happy to vote in favour of the report on the mid-term review of the strategy of the European Union for occupational health and safety today. I would like to emphasise three points that I consider particularly important. The first is paragraph 82, which we approved today. I would have preferred it if we had given an even clearer signal in regard to work-life balance, everything relating to occupational health and how we regulate work, the rhythm we provide workers with, including, above all, the protection of Sundays as a day of rest. I myself have launched an initiative in this regard and I believe we can all play our part in supporting March 3 next year as a Europe-wide day for Sunday as a day of rest. I also believe paragraph 16 is particularly important. After all, burnout is one of the illnesses that generates the highest costs in Europe. We urgently need a burnout strategy, and next year the European Commission is to publish a relevant study, as well as holding out the prospect of a Green Paper. This is something we urgently need to discuss in Europe. Finally, as the rapporteur for the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations 2012, I would like to make the following call: let us work together in Europe to ensure we respect everyone, both workers and employers alike, in health, vitality and dignity. Martin Kastler  (PPE

I voted against this report today. No one could disagree with the common objective of the EU Member States of halving the number of road traffic fatalities. Almost 100 people are still dying on Europe’s roads every day. The goal is clear – the question is how to get there. Transport policy is, and remains, a national, regional and partly local issue. Successes are only achieved if they are closely based on the reality of people’s lives. Europe is not the right arena for this. Even if all the proposals were scientifically based, this is still not a matter for the EU. The best example of this is the scientifically-based proposal that, in future, children under three years of age should only travel in secure, rear-facing car seats. As a young father, I am well aware that no child aged two or three will want to sit facing backwards on the rear seat. What is more, drivers can no longer see their children, so who knows what might happen. This own-initiative report is superfluous. Signals like this are counter-productive, particularly in the current climate of crisis. We must concentrate on essentials. Martin Kastler,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, next year will be the first year in which there will be more retired people than workers in Europe. This is a major turning point in Europe. It is a good sign that we are today voting to make the year 2012 the European Year for Active Ageing and for solidarity between generations, and we will also duly celebrate it and present it to the public. At this point, I would like to thank the Commission, the Council and the shadow rapporteurs most sincerely for the fact that we were able to reach a compromise together at first reading, and this is the compromise that we are presenting here today and will jointly adopt. I would like to refer you to an amendment that I would ask you to support. A European Year also requires a certain amount of publicity and for that we also need money. We have fought for a budget line for this so that a certain amount is available in order to present to the public the subject of solidarity between generations as well as the subject of active ageing. Thank you very much and I would ask for your support. (Applause) Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have voted today on the report by Mr Goerens and I believe that this report is moving in the right direction. For the first time in the history of the European Union, we have done away with the unquestioning belief in budget support in the field of development aid. This means that for the first time we have stated in a report that we should not simply give money to administrative bodies, to states or to governments without sanctions and without criteria that can be monitored. This is the right way forward. However, in my opinion one thing is missing. This concerns an amendment which I have tabled and which was unfortunately voted down. The amendment stated that we in the European Union must impose sanctions when a state can be proved to have disregarded the criteria which form the basis for the provision of development aid. We must change this situation so that we can maintain our credibility and make it clear to our voters and our taxpayers what we are spending development aid on. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the few of you who are still here, visitors to the European Parliament, in conclusion, I would like to make some brief remarks on the subject of misleading directory companies. I have voted in favour of the resolution because it is important for us in the European Union to make our opinion clear on this. This is a part of organised crime in Europe which involves bogus companies taking money from people and from small and medium-sized businesses over the Internet. We must make every effort to prevent this from happening. The Commission has made many soapbox speeches calling for genuine support to be given to small and medium-sized companies and for the amount of red tape to be reduced. One important aspect of this is to bring an end to this type of organised crime. The resolution represents a step in the right direction, but only a small one. We must take action and, therefore, I am calling on everyone to continue with this work, not only those Members who are not here, but all of us who represent the citizens of Europe in Parliament.

 I voted in favour of this report as I believe that businesses have a social responsibility – towards their employees and customers, the environment and society at large. A new term has been added to the German dictionary: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). This is – and should remain – a voluntary matter. In our globalised markets, CSR entails much more than making a donation to the local football club. Businesses that operate in a globally responsible way help shape foreign policy and development policy. They are Europe’s ambassadors to the world, flying the flag for Europe’s social standards worldwide. We should support CSR, not regulate it. In this case, Europe’s role should be that of a moderator, not a regulator. This principle must be applied if the European Commission is to get serious and take up the topic of CSR once again: we do not need excessive regulation. We have underlined this position with this report. Martin Kastler  (PPE

Madam President, I also voted in favour of this report and of this resolution – in favour of Macedonia. However, if we are being honest about this, then there is one detail that must be mentioned. We cannot tell people and ethnic groups in other countries to rename their language because other countries do not like what they call it. That is laid down in international law, and as Europeans we must be sure that we remain honest about this. I was consequently very annoyed that unfortunately, one amendment was passed that I voted against, which stated that Macedonian should not be allowed to be called Macedonian. Macedonia is a country with great prospects in Europe mainly because it also has great economic prospects in the Balkans, a region that has genuine difficulties, is prospering economically, and is conducting the negotiations with élan – which is very positive. In view of this positive attitude, I would like to thank all the Members who voted for this resolution, as well as all those who worked with the parliament there as part of the European Parliament delegation. We should make these prospects clear to the people there who want to be part of Europe. Let us work together to that end. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I have voted in favour of the Oomen-Ruijten report and would like to emphasise two points. Firstly, when we see that in some countries in Europe too many pensions are being paid out too early, but these countries are getting into difficulties and the others are having to bail them out, that is unfair. This unfairness cannot, of course, be refinanced via the EU. We need European coordination in this regard. The second point that I am very pleased with in this report is the fact that it makes it very clear, according to the principle of subsidiarity, that the Member States themselves are responsible for pension provision. That is indeed the case. I therefore consider this report to be a step in the right direction in that, on the one hand, we in Europe are recognising that our citizens want more coordination in the social sphere because they feel unfairly treated and, on the other, we are making it clear where the main responsibility lies, namely with the Member States. This report represents a step in this direction. We will do everything possible to ensure that the White Paper continues to push ahead with this. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 It is shocking that Christians throughout the world continue to be persecuted and murdered. It is an indictment of Europe that the foreign ministers of the Member States in the Council cannot manage to respond to this. They treat the will of Parliament with contempt. The EU must do something. I call on the Council to show responsibility for the basic right of freedom of religion, to swiftly draw up an implementable strategy to protect Christians throughout the world and to establish a separate unit for intercultural and religious matters in the European External Action Service. These things need to be done now, not some time in the future. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Today’s vote on the European citizens’ initiative is a milestone for more democracy in Europe. I welcome the compromise and I will support it, because the report produced by Mr Lamassoure and Mrs Gurmai is the first step in the right direction. Ladies and gentlemen, we must not be afraid of citizens having more opportunities to express their will. We must give the citizens of Europe more codecision rights, not just every five years at the European elections. This needs courage, stamina and strength. Courage to keep returning to the dialogue. Stamina, because decisions cannot necessarily be made more quickly and strength because our representative democracy includes, at last, in my opinion, more participative elements. Our goal must be to increase the dialogue in Europe between the citizens and the politicians. I am pleased that we are moving one step closer to the Europe of the citizens today with the European citizens’ initiative. I am convinced that one day we Europeans will take joint European decisions, in the form of citizens’ decisions. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 I have voted in favour of the amendments and against the Berlinguer report, because I am not sure that it provides adequate support for subsidiarity. I do not believe that we should be able to delete important details just because this is a large package of directives. This is a strategy which will backfire. For me, the crux of the matter is paragraph 40, which, in the form that it was adopted today, together with other components of the Stockholm Programme, will provoke conflicts of jurisdiction. In specific terms, there are doubts as to whether we should use family law for the mutual recognition of civil status documents, in other words, marriage certificates, and, therefore, whether we should take into account the decision-making authority of the Member States with regard to the definition of marriage, following the procedure outlined in Article 81(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. While this remains unclear, there is a risk of a conflict between the simple procedures of civil law and the complex procedures of cross-border family law. A sentence corresponding with Amendment 3 would have been sufficient to defuse this conflict. This is a detail which, unfortunately, was not supported by the majority in Parliament today. I remain of the opinion that marriage and family life are under the specific protection of the state. They are exclusively a matter for the Member States. Therefore, I have voted against this own-initiative report. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I would like to respond briefly to what Mr Hannan has just said. It is, of course, essential for this Parliament to have a seat, but the seat is established by our treaties and it is here in Strasbourg. You are right to say that we need to save taxpayers’ money and that we must work towards being based in one place. However, the refuge of parliamentarianism, Mr Hannan, is here in Strasbourg. This is where we as Members of Parliament and representatives of the people can work together. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, the Estrela report yesterday covered a very important topic. I would like to say at this point that it was rather difficult for me to vote in favour of it. As a young father, I was present at the birth of both my children and I have to say that I do not know why I would have needed a holiday then, because I did not give birth, my wife did. This is all about maternity leave and we have included fathers. It is difficult point. Nevertheless, it is important for young women to have the opportunity to have a child and then to return to their professional life. I believe that this will be possible under the new system. Although I would personally have preferred 18 weeks, I did eventually vote in favour of 20 weeks in the final vote. We must now ask ourselves whether this will bring more justice and more children in Europe. Family policy in Europe is an issue for the future. I hope that we are sending out a signal that we have taken action in this area. Now we just have to hope that the Member States take corresponding measures. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, incarcerating people in labour camps because they do not share the same views as a governing regime is a crime against human dignity. Slave labour camps, re-education camps and internment camps – these are all anachronisms that have lost none of their repugnance in the 21st century, wherever in the world they may be. I am truly disappointed that the European Commission, against our better judgment, has failed to present any concrete measures to the Members of this House to deal with the Chinese case and has not explained how it envisages future cooperation between the EU and China. If the US has lists of businesses and if books exist publishing the names of businesses that are known to be a front for internment camps, then why is it that you do not have them? Why are you taking this blinkered approach? You and the Commission are making yourselves share in the blame for the misery suffered by those who have been imprisoned, mostly without due legal process. No one could want this. The rule of law is one of our fundamental principles in Europe and in the European Union. As an MEP, I am ashamed to have had to listen to what was said here today. Nonetheless, I am pleased, on the other hand, that we have drawn attention here to this principle of the rule of law for liberty and for human dignity on a cross-party basis. I would like to thank the House for this. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are taking a new and important step forward in the field of animal welfare by providing more protection for animals used in scientific research. We have heard a great deal about animal welfare. We have also heard that Europe is an important location for industrial research and innovation. However, there is one issue which we have not talked about enough. This concerns a fundamental value of the European Union, namely human dignity, and the question of how we handle it. I believe that we must not, on the one hand, improve animal welfare and, on the other, expose ourselves to risks in an area which, at least in part, runs counter to our European values. Why am I saying this? The European Commission has referred to alternative methods in its documents. These include five methods relating to research into and use of embryonic stem cells and, in particular, human stem cells. In my opinion, this is immoral. It is something which I cannot ignore when it comes to voting today on the proposed compromise between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Therefore, I would like to call on you and, in particular, on the Council, the Member States and the Commission, in the form of the so-called Regulatory Committee, to take a highly sensitive approach. When we show concern for human dignity, this does not mean that we are opposed to animal welfare. On the contrary, we want both of these things. We want to cooperate to protect the dignity of living creatures, whether they are animals or humans, in a way that corresponds to our European concept of dignity, so that we can work together to defend and support it. One of Europe’s trademarks is that we are prepared to fight for human freedom and dignity. For this reason, I will not be able to take part in today’s vote, because in moral terms, it is not possible for me to do one thing and ignore another. Discussing this subject today was the right thing to do, but the third dimension of human dignity has come off rather badly. Martin Kastler  (PPE

I welcome the report on the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States prepared by Mr Őry. Why is that? In this report, the European Parliament has made it very clear what we Europeans can expect in the coming years in the area of work and employment. In addition to the questions of migration and demographic change, the potential for employment in Europe in the area of the so-called ‘green economy’ is a very important issue. This potential can only be exploited successfully if there are sufficient qualified jobs available. This offers a unique opportunity for women at management level in particular. Both men and women have equal opportunities in this dynamic and still relatively new area of business, something that is sometimes more difficult in other areas. It is necessary to ensure that it is possible to balance work and family life, for example, by creating family-friendly jobs and by providing childcare facilities. It must be possible to establish individual models for working hours, as well as part-time arrangements, particularly for those in management positions. Unfortunately, this is not yet possible in all parts of Europe’s labour market. Martin Kastler,

 Mr President, in 2007 and 2008, Libya voted against the United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for a moratorium on executions, and the repeated questioning by human rights organisations elicited no official statements either. It is therefore very important to us that the names of the people who have been executed are now officially revealed at last. Any execution is one too many. We condemn the use of executions and the death penalty. They are inhumane and cruel, and any execution is one too many. In our resolution, therefore, we clearly ask that we change this situation and bring it to light and that we now work together to bring about a change here. No more underreporting. Instead we want transparent information on what happens here and a humane penalty for genuine criminals, but no excessive punishment for those who criticise the regime in Tripoli.

Madam President, around 75% to 80% of all those suffering religious persecution worldwide are Christians. We in the European Parliament are fighting specifically for human rights throughout the world. For me, religious freedom is a central concept of our human rights policy. Therefore, I regret that those on the left and the liberal left in the European Parliament often join together to keep silent about the fate of Christians. At the same time, I am pleased that we are jointly tabling a resolution today about the dreadful situation in Pakistan. Of the 156 million people in Pakistan, 95% are Muslims, around 3% Christians and around 2% Hindus. As a Christian, I would like to focus once again on the situation of the Pakistani Christians, who are subjected to severe persecution. Anyone who allows violent attacks on Christians to take place must receive a response from the civilised world. Therefore, the EU should introduce a criterion in its development policy and economic cooperation which covers this issue and allows sanctions to be applied if necessary. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I have voted in favour of this report and I would like to congratulate Mr Mikolášik on the excellent work he has done. I believe that today is an important day, because we have ensured that donors and recipients of organs will have consistent standards and greater safety.

 Mr President, the citizens of Europe are right. They like honest foods and they like honest politicians. I respect public opinion of this kind. We cannot simply ignore public opinion and we cannot simply dismiss it as populism. That is not the case. We must take notice of what our citizens are saying to us. If our constituents and our citizens are of the opinion that real meat must be real meat and that it must not be made of pieces of meat glued together, then we must make sure that it is not possible for meat to be processed in this way. This is why I have voted against allowing thrombin to be used as a food glue. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted against this report for two reasons. Firstly, I am disturbed that Europe is increasingly taking a scatter-gun approach to development policy and that more and more resolutions and requests are encouraging this approach. Secondly, I have voted against the report, because I believe it is a bad thing for us to try to impose family planning policy on developing and emerging countries in the form of a sort of cultural imperialism. Abortion is not a solution and I regret the fact that some Members of the European Parliament refer euphemistically to ‘reproductive medicine’ when they mean abortion. This does not change the fact that abortion means killing an unborn child. Therefore, I have voted against this report and I hope that in future, we will not use the same euphemistic terms in every resolution and own-initiative report to describe aspects of cultural imperialism. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of those people who has brought one of the first citizens’ initiative petitions into being, specifically, on the subject of protecting Sundays. Today, we have the pleasure of debating – and then deciding upon – a potential way of involving the citizens in the process of Europe’s political work. That means that this is a potential way to bring about more democracy and to counter Europe-fatigue. That said, I am not here just to give praise. Rather, I have two requests to make of you, when you now take this Regulation into its final phase. Firstly, we Europeans are technologically advanced people. I would like to ask you to make the Internet the definitive medium so that a citizens’ initiative with a million signatures is also admissible with electronic signatures, which are also legally binding. Secondly, I would like to point out that what we are doing here is just a first step. I would like to go a step further. We now have a right of initiative for the citizens. It would be my wish, however, for us to also have referendums, as we have in my home region of Bavaria, at the European level in future. What happens is that there is a petition for a referendum, then, when enough people have put their name to it, there is the possibility of a referendum. It would be my wish that we should also have this in Europe. Martin Kastler,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is regrettable that a number of States around the world still, in this day and age, conduct or permit this inhumane kind of punishment for serious criminals. I believe that nobody has the right to decide about the life or death of another person, be it at the beginning or the end of that life, and certainly not in connection with punishing a criminal act. This barbaric punishment by execution has no place in the modern world. The unforgettable, great Pope John Paul II pointed out that, above all, atonement, the chance for reconciliation, must be possible. With an irreversible act such as the death penalty, that is not possible. That is why, as parliamentary groups, we are joining forces to call on our colleagues in South Korea to take up this subject in their parliament and to join with us Europeans to campaign for the abolition of the death penalty, as a mark of humanity. I would like to call on all Members to support this joint motion for a resolution unanimously. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say on behalf of part of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and, above all, on behalf of my colleague, Elmar Brok, that we are shocked that the House has today rejected the amendment which would have included Christians and other religious minorities in this report. I think it is truly outrageous that, although we are constantly making statements on human rights issues, we do not believe it is worth protecting parts of the population who are being persecuted because of their religious background. It is a great pity that we could not accept the amendment which concerns a subject that is of great importance for the future of the world. If we are not able to protect minorities for whatever reason, we no longer have the right to claim that the European Parliament is the home of human rights, of fundamental rights and of this struggle throughout the world. I have voted against this, because religious minorities should not be excluded. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am somewhat surprised that, in this House, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) stands accused of forcing this topic, which, although urgent, is probably not to the liking of any member of the Left majority of this House, onto the agenda. I doubt that they constitute a majority in this House. I simply had to ask that question. Like all the other groups, our group is also perfectly entitled to raise this matter. Even though Mr Chávez, who is currently in power, might be some kind of chum of yours or of the previous Spanish Presidency-in-Office, we still simply have to ask what action is being taken in this regard. I am quite amazed that somebody like Mr Chávez can possibly say things like ‘Twitter is a terrorist system’. I am sorry, but anyone in this day and age who describes Twitter as a terrorist system is living in another world, back in the stone age. Let me tell you this, as well: We, the PPE Group, will not be cowed by this accusation. We denounce violations of human rights everywhere. I personally denounce human rights violations when it comes to freedom of the press. On that score, let me just say that Venezuelan journalists are spoon-fed and dictated to and that judges are thrown into jail if they release someone who has been wrongly arrested. As Europeans, we must have the courage to speak out against such practices. I will not allow Mrs de Keyser and others in this House to pin this accusation on the PPE Group. Like anyone else, we are perfectly entitled to designate violations of human rights and freedoms, whether in Europe or anywhere else across the world, as topics worthy of debate. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I would just like to draw your attention to the fact that all the groups have endorsed this motion for a resolution. That is as it should be, because this topic is very important. In contrast to the previous speakers, I would like to say that we must ensure that we do not merely promote freedom of expression and freedom of the press in this country, but that we also actively demand them, now that we are examining ways that we could help things proceed towards a, hopefully, peaceful election. We have to ensure that we, as Europeans, establish freedom of the press in all areas, with all the financial assistance that is needed to make that possible. We also have to provide full support and endeavour to act together to provide financial assistance, within the scope of the agreements which we have with this country. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 It is commendable that the new Macedonian democracy has made further progress in all areas of society and business. I very much welcome the fact that the presidential and local elections in March 2009 went smoothly. This is an indication of the growing democratisation throughout the entire region which was reflected in Macedonia. Macedonia has met all the criteria for liberalising the visa regulations and, therefore, from 19 December 2009 onwards, its citizens have visa-free status. This represents a major step forward. However, Macedonia still has a number of reforms to implement. I very much hope that we can use the experience which we gathered during the first phase of the eastern enlargement of the EU to help it in this process. In this context, I am thinking of the implementation of institutional reforms, where political foundations and a range of different NGOs have achieved so much. There are two areas where we should strengthen our cooperation with regard to transformation and EU standards. These are reform in the public administration, in the judiciary and in the police. Personally, I would like to see the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece put aside in the immediate future. It is important that progress towards the unification of Europe is not brought to a standstill because of bilateral disagreements. Martin Kastler,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the massacre on 23 November of last year in the Province of Maguindanao in the Philippines was a black day for human rights and a barbaric act of terrorism. Fifty seven people were killed, women were raped, people were injured – they convey a bloody message. As a journalist, it struck me, in particular, that there were 30 journalists among those killed. According to the renowned International Crisis Group, in no other case on record have more journalists ever been murdered at one time. For this reason, it is appropriate for the European Parliament to make a clear statement, as we are doing today in this draft resolution. However, as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we request that the present text be toned down in three places through a split vote, because we ought to support the Philippine Government in its fight against terrorism and violence and therefore dispense with overly accusatory remarks directed at the government. Therefore, on behalf of the PPE Group, I request a separate vote on recital F. This accuses the Philippines of showing all the signs of a non-functional legal system. In paragraph 2, we would like to delete the insinuation about what are referred to as initial delays in the investigation. Finally, in paragraph 6, it is claimed that some missing persons are locked away in Philippine prisons. This, too, is currently an unproven insinuation and should, in our opinion, be deleted.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be voting in favour of this report, as I think that the deepening of cooperation between the European Union and the ACP states within the framework of the partnership agreements is important. That said, I would like to point out that this report contains the wording ‘protection of sexual and reproductive health’. Yet what is behind this phrase? Does it, first of all, mean ensuring people’s physical and mental well-being in relation to all areas of human sexuality and reproduction, for example, by combating sexual violence and genital mutilation? Does it, secondly, mean access to information about what has come to be called family planning? Or, thirdly, does it also include abortion? In the past, the Commission and the Council have made it clear in relation to questions from MEPs that this ‘sexual and reproductive health’ does not include abortion. That is exactly how I see it. I therefore think it important to establish that the term ‘the sexual and reproductive health of women’ is not in the context of abortion and I am therefore proposing a clarification to that effect in the text of the agreement.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what does freedom of religion actually mean? The answer is quite simple. It is the freedom to practise religion. Freedom of religion is not freedom from religion but the freedom to have religion. Freedom of religion does not create a religion-free society, but rather gives people the right to practice their religion openly within society. A crucifix in the classroom does not force anyone to believe, or not to believe. Therefore, it does not violate the freedom of religion. Nor have I ever heard of a right entitling someone not to be confronted with religious symbols. If this were the case, we would, in fact, immediately have to prohibit all crosses on gravestones and all church spires. The crucifix ruling of the European Court of Human Rights is therefore not only an attack on the principle of subsidiarity, but it also violates the right to religious freedom itself. We, the European Parliament, cannot and must not accept this ruling. The European Court of Human Rights should administer justice and not become a puppet for ideological and anti-Christian interests. Otherwise, we will have to seriously consider whether this Court actually still has a purpose at all. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have also voted no, because I am of the opinion that Turkey must first fulfil all the criteria, before we can make such a positive statement here. In particular, I would like to highlight the border dispute between Cyprus and Turkey, which has still not been settled this year, and the illegal occupation of Cyprus, which has not yet been brought to an end. However, I did not want to vote against the other accession candidates. I would particularly make an exception in the case of the Balkan States which I would like to welcome here in this House as soon as possible. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is often the case that good intentions cause problems. No one here would question the fact that non-smokers need comprehensive protection. However, the compromise motion for a resolution on smoke-free environments on which we will be voting on Thursday goes far beyond the protection of non-smokers. Even though the current draft explicitly supports the principle of subsidiarity, it also undermines it. The motion calls for strict and legally binding regulations at EU level. It abuses valid concern for health protection in an attempt to transfer invalid authority in the field of health policy and of work and social issues to a European level. We all want a Europe which is close to its people and the principle of subsidiarity is the key to this. The Member States or, in the case of Germany, the federal states, must have their own discussions on the protection of non-smokers. This is the only way to identify solutions which suit each country’s traditions and culture and are therefore close to its people. For these reasons, I would ask you to vote against the motion for a resolution in its current form on Thursday. Martin Kastler,

Mr President, on 2 October this year, the Iranian police stopped a man from boarding an aircraft at the last minute. The lawyer, Abdolfattah Soltani, was due to receive the International Human Rights Award for 2009 in my home town of Nuremburg for his courageous work on behalf of victims of political persecution. Despite having a valid passport, the Iranian powers refused to allow Mr Soltani to leave the country for no legal reason. His wife was allowed to leave. She rightly stated, and I quote: ‘It pains me that in a country that calls itself a theocracy, acts are committed that have nothing to do with God’. Iran is bound under international law by its ratification of the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which stipulates the human right that everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own. I find it scandalous that Iran is trampling this right underfoot. I am therefore lobbying for the Soltani case to be included in our joint resolution today, in our resolution on Iran, and I ask for your support. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

Mr President, first of all, I agree with fellow Members who have said that old accounts that are still unpaid must be settled. We should do so promptly in order to avoid additional interest which would make them even more expensive. It will not enhance our credibility with the public if we cannot disburse funds that they have applied for and have been granted and to which they are legally entitled.  That is why the amending budget must be formulated as a matter of urgency. The problem that we face for 2013, however, is that if the budget is too low, the amending budget will ultimately be even higher, for the previous year’s commitment appropriations will come back to haunt us, with all their financial implications. I have every understanding for the difficulties posed by crises, but if we genuinely want to make changes, we will have to talk about the commitment appropriations in connection with the multiannual financial framework, and that includes discussing how they should be dealt with. However, the past cannot be dealt with by questioning the law. I am most grateful to the Council and the Cyprus Presidency for engaging in such intensive negotiations. Monika Hohlmeier,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the PPE member responsible for Parliament’s budget, I also want to offer warm thanks to my colleague Derek Vaughan for the close and very fruitful cooperation we have had with all the other shadow rapporteurs. Although Croatia is now also a Member, which has imposed extra costs on the European Parliament, we have managed to stand by a 1.9 % rise, i.e. one that is actually below the normal rate of inflation. To that end, we have also made clear savings in a very wide variety of sectors, which means that we have managed to adopt a draft budget for the European Parliament that is also agreed with the Commission or in line with the Commission’s views. At the same time, however, I would ask those colleagues who may not mean any wrong but basically think we need more and more cuts to the European Parliament’s budget to remember that MEPs must be able to operate under proper working conditions and must also have the chance to review the documents presented by the Commission and proposals such as those put forward by the Member States at the European summit, and then in the end to be able to live with them. We need a competent Parliament, which is why we also need sensible, good and solid funding. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Schengen is one of the greatest achievements in the European Union, however I am also aware that our Member States are sensitive of their borders and are likely to remain so. I am aware that the problems that exist between the Member States in relation to Schengen cannot simply be ignored. These problems are many and varied. Ignoring these problems does not make them any better or easier to resolve. I live near the border with the Czech Republic and no one on our side would ever dream of simply closing the border again when problems are encountered. I would also call on the Commission to offer support in this area, rather than restrictions and rebukes. Dragnet controls were incorporated because we wish to ensure security while still allowing freedom to travel. If we are to be successful in implementing dragnet controls at locations that are frequent crossing points for drug dealers, such as the Czech border in particular, then I believe it is best for the German and Czech interior ministers to sit down together to find a joint solution to the problems that exist at the border. The Commission should not adopt a regulatory role here, but rather a positive supporting role. We wish to rein in the populists, but also to resolve the real problems in a concerted approach. That is why I am also calling on the Council to seek a solution together with Parliament, so that we can successfully conclude the Schengen dossier, upholding freedom to travel while also ensuring the security of our citizens.

 Madam President, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, today, I would like to focus, in particular, on the subject of the agencies. I have noticed that there is no specific focus on financing for the agencies in 2013 or in the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020. To give you a few examples, there are the new supervisory agencies: the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). If these agencies are to do justice to the job which we were discussing once again at the weekend, then they need to be equipped to do it properly, because otherwise, we will ultimately not be able to implement all the plans that we have put in place. Another example is Europol. Europol manages its budget very carefully. In 2011, it had particularly high levels of transfers because some programmes had begun later. The fact that Europol is now being punished with a 10% reduction and is supposed to establish a cybercrime centre with its current funding is simply impossible. We need to ensure that the agencies are properly financed and, at the same time, we need to monitor the management board structures, because I believe that the large number of members on the boards sometimes means that the agencies are managed less efficiently.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to discuss the subject of development aid. The question of budget aid has been a concern for us in the context of development aid for many years. I would like to express my thanks to the Court of Auditors for its numerous very sensible suggestions on this subject. I would also like to thank Commissioner Piebalgs for his increasing efforts to regulate budget aid in a sensible way. Budget aid is appropriate if there is a degree of certainty that the local administration is capable of using this budget aid to implement the projects undertaken in cooperation with the European Union. Secondly, we need to come up with a consistent concept in the area of development aid. I find myself repeating at every discharge hearing that all development aid spending needs to be introduced into the Commission budget at the same time and not just because we want to avoid exceeding the 1% limit. The money will certainly be spent. The question is simply whether it is spent in a coordinated, consistent and mutually agreed way and whether the European Parliament can play a role in spending decisions, rather than just monitoring spending. It is for this reason that I believe it is necessary to focus on the question of long-term and short-term measures in the context of development aid. We need long-term sustainable measures that will lead to improvements in the relevant countries as the years progress. Naturally, we also need short-term measures that can provide rapid relief in response to disasters, such as earthquakes, etc. However, when it comes to long-term projects, we cannot allow standards to be relaxed simply because the conditions in a particular country are not what they might be. Our projects need to make sense and have a purpose, otherwise we will find ourselves spending money for no good reason. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

Madam President, to begin with I would like to thank the European Asylum Support Office which has now started to take highly efficient measures, to give serious help to Greece and to play a very effective role, in particular with regard to what many Members have just called for, in other words, providing reasonable asylum accommodation. A few days ago the Greek Parliament decided that additional accommodation which meets European standards should be built. The European Union will or should give support for this, with the help of the European Asylum Support Office. I believe it is important that we in this Chamber do not constantly talk only about the dreadful things that have happened or the difficulties. Instead we should make it quite clear what we want to do and explain that we are not demanding that Greece comes up with a perfect solution overnight, given its disastrous internal situation. We will be applying realistic standards to the country and to what it is able to achieve. I also think it is sensible that many countries have stopped returning refugees and will continue to do so in future. Secondly, it seems to me to be important for us to extend our cooperation with Turkey. Ms Malmström has said that we are making an effort to do this. I think that amalgamating visa policy and return policy will cause significant problems. However, one possibility might be not to opt for the larger framework for visa policy, but instead to focus only on students and those in similar situations, including business people. This could be a solution for the countries which may currently still have difficulties in this area. Thirdly, we should agree on cooperation between police forces with regard to returning refugees, because this is about combating criminal people traffickers who are making money at the expense of poor refugees. It is not about disagreements with Turkey over questions of content. I hope and believe that Turkey is ready to start cooperating with our police forces on these issues.

Madam President, I believe that we must attempt, in collaboration with the European Asylum Support Office and the Greek authorities, to identify which of the people who have come to Greece could possibly be transferred to other countries within the European Union, firstly, because they can definitely never return to their home country and, secondly, because they may have potential and qualifications which are appropriate and useful. However, this is essentially also about helping the Greeks to register and identify these people more quickly, so that help can be provided sooner and so that those people who do not have qualifications or the entitlement to live in Greece or the European Union can be returned to their home countries, because they do have the opportunity of remaining there.

Mr President, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, ITER is a long-term research project. This means that we cannot simply shelve the treaties that we have entered into and the future plans that we have made in the important area of energy research every time we encounter a crisis or financial difficulties. We cannot decide not to comply with these treaties any longer and to turn a technology of the future into a technology of the past. I was somewhat suspicious about the claim that this technology should be a thing of the past. I was suspicious because we did not make smooth progress during the 30 years of research simply as a result of the fact that 30 years ago we did not have the computer capacity that we have today, which we needed both for materials research and for managing the high temperatures. This is why we have only been able to forge ahead rapidly with the ITER research in recent years. When we launch large projects, we must ensure that they are on a sound financial footing right from the start. This is a lesson which we need to learn within the European Union with regard to a variety of projects. When we start projects, they must have a professional project management team from the very beginning, an accurate and realistic estimate of costs, not simply one which sounds good in political terms, detailed financial controlling, a professional tendering process and a project support and monitoring function which can guarantee us an overview of the actual costs in the short and medium term. This is a long-term research project. It will not be completed in a short period and this is why I believe it is necessary for us not only to continue with this project, but also to acknowledge its future prospects. I have been to Cadarache myself and I have a different impression from yours, Ms Durant. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to give my sincere thanks to Mr Vaughan, the main rapporteur, and also to my fellow rapporteurs. We have worked very closely together and shared detailed information in the attempt to identify sensible solutions which would allow us to take the first step towards producing estimates of revenue and expenditure. I believe that it is very much worth mentioning that the increase in funding for the European Parliament is below the rate of inflation and that we will be carrying out an intensive and systematic evaluation of Parliament’s spending between now and the autumn, in order to identify further potential for cutting costs. In this context, we want to make it very clear to the public that while we are aware that the European Parliament needs a sensible level of resources to be able to work effectively, we also want to exploit every opportunity to introduce savings. From my perspective, this also involves making careful use of money where we take measures relating to the building. In this respect, it is also important to mention that we have already made some initial savings and that we have been able to bring about a significant reduction in some excessive rents. As far as bringing everything together on one site is concerned, I would like to suggest that we calculate the costs and the consequences of moving to one site, rather than just quoting the fictitious costs resulting from the journeys caused by being based at different sites. This will be necessary in order to carry out a useful analysis, since there are officials who do not have to travel at all, because they have no direct connection with Parliament and its work. Under these circumstances, moving to one site would not bring any benefits. We simply need to analyse the situation carefully and impartially. I would like to thank my fellow Members once again, because I believe that we are submitting good estimates. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the nature of the debate in this House shows that we represent the entire spectrum of opinion: on the one side, we have those who do not want restrictions of any kind, while on the other are those who associate any form of immigration with the risk of a massive influx of people. These are the two extremes to be found within the House. Family reunification must be viewed with a great deal of common sense and rationalism. On the one hand, problems genuinely exist in Member States with excessively restrictive policies. After all, we cannot put so many obstacles in the way of reuniting families that, in the end, reunification becomes an impossibility. On the other hand, Member States are fully justified in demanding language skills and integration, for example, or at least a willingness to integrate within a state. Secondly, the Member States naturally have the right to point out the problems that arise with family reunification, problems that should not be swept under the carpet. If countries like Greece, Malta, Romania or Italy are no longer permitted to indicate the problems they experience in this context, then I am not certain that we are taking a democratic approach by simply ignoring problems. We do not need another new directive. We should debate the problems carefully and then consider how we can remedy them. The continuous production of new directives will not lead to an improvement in the directives or their implementation. We are currently experiencing implementation problems in some areas. I completely understand that we need to engage in debate first, rather than drawing up yet another new directive and adding something to it before we have thoroughly discussed the old directive and the associated problems. I am in favour of listening to the Member States and of respecting the basic right of family reunification. If this is done in a reasoned and understanding way, then we will also achieve some progress. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by sincerely thanking my colleague, the rapporteur Mr Vaughan, for his excellent cooperation and his readiness to discuss the various problems in depth and to find a solution. We already presented an austerity budget last year, in which the actual original budget only rose by 0.8% and, in view of the additional costs incurred through the accession of Croatia and the Treaty of Lisbon, we still remained below the inflation rate of 1%, achieving 1.9%. This year, we are again publishing guidelines for an austerity budget, seeking to show that we are aware that we are in an environment in which it is not possible to make enormous financial leaps forward, but rather that consolidation is the order of the day, so that the budget will need to be examined in terms of efficiency and the potential for cutting costs. I also welcome the convening of a working group that is to bring in external experts as deemed necessary and useful, to work in this direction with the Bureau, the Secretariat and Parliament’s administration. I also believe it is right for us to further strengthen interinstitutional cooperation and that we should further optimise the way in which Parliament works in terms of organisation, efficiency, the use of financial resources and personnel. This has enabled us to save EUR 21 million in the area of translation and interpreting alone in a single year and we want to continue in this vein this year. As Mr Vaughan has said, we are freezing travel costs and day-to-day expenses and, with regard to buildings policy – after all I am the rapporteur on buildings – I believe it necessary for us to examine closely what we have agreed to see whether buildings policy and construction projects are being managed in a professional, cost-efficient manner. The particular aim will be to save costs in the medium term, in particular annually recurring costs, and to exploit the relevant synergies. We also expect the other institutions to join us in our efforts and to offer their support. I believe it is necessary for us to navigate a course in which the precise work of Parliament is linked with efficiency and good organisation. I would like to thank the Parliament administration, the Secretariat and the Bureau for their excellent cooperation and hope that we succeed in presenting a reasonable, solid and well-considered budget.

We voted against the report on the recasting of the regulation on public access to documents. The report goes far beyond the objective of achieving greater transparency by improving public access to documents. Existing legislation and interinstitutional agreements are ignored and the protection of intellectual property, sensitive and personal data is treated with contempt. Administrative processes and decisions, including those relating to personnel issues, should be published. The same applies to the protection of trade secrets and sensitive information within the framework of approval procedures, court proceedings and competition procedures. The report contains definitions that are vague, lack clarity and cast their net too widely. Any data or content connected in any way with the policies, measures and decisions of all bodies and institutions of the EU is defined as a document. This largely also includes preparatory, confidential and secret documents, as well as all associated information. Thus, the definition covers not only documents, but also information. The publication of information from ongoing interinstitutional processes, such as informal trialogue negotiations, enables public access to the procedure. This would open up the possibility of external influence. Lobbyists would have direct access to the legislative process. This report does not benefit our citizens. It would lead to a deluge of useless information, leading to a greater lack of transparency and rendering our work impossible. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, Ms Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control have both paid great attention to ensuring that in future the ITER project will be well managed, its finances will be monitored, its funding will be properly evaluated and the financial increases will be kept within reasonable bounds. However, I believe it is a major problem, in the case of a project established jointly by the Member States, which the Member States have decided on in the Council, when the Council opts in the same breath to increase research funding and extend the financing available for research and this results in cuts in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, in order to make more money available for ITER. This was not what was originally decided on by the Member States. Agreement was reached in the trialogue and my admiration goes to the rapporteur who showed the patience of a saint in attempting to ensure that progress was made in the negotiations. I would like to know how we in Europe are supposed to improve our global reputation when we demonstrate that we are lacking in unity and unable to agree in the context of a large international project. Making a note of this kind in the minutes about an amount of EUR 360 million, which retrospectively calls into question a joint compromise reached in the trialogue, is a simply disgraceful way of presenting ourselves to the rest of the world. We should see ITER as a really important project and Parliament is prepared to do this. However, in this case the Member States need to make some sensible proposals on financing the decision that they have reached, without once again interfering with the field of research. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am rather bewildered to hear some fellow Members saying that this directive would allegedly encourage unchecked mass immigration. The reality is the exact opposite. We are talking here about those with a proper work and residence permit, and if they are doing the same work as an EU citizen, then such people should also receive the same usual types of social benefits within the European Union as any other person would get. This safeguards those who work properly and with the right papers; it is not opening any floodgates. I also find it most amusing that some Members are complaining that too many groups are excluded, while others are complaining that mass immigration will take place. I congratulate the rapporteur. She seems to have found the golden middle way between giving the Member States the necessary individual powers of differentiation in certain decision areas and, on the other hand, providing a certain guarantee of social security for those working according to the rules. It should be a matter of course that family benefits depend on length of stay, but that someone who has earned a pension is able to take it with them if they have worked according to the rules. I therefore find it rather strange that people’s concerns that many workers will be crowded out of the labour market are being fuelled here. This directive has nothing to do with that. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in contrast to the previous speaker, I would like to begin by observing that, in my view, the European Parliament does not wish to express a resolution of no confidence in the Council. In other words, the motion that we are tabling does not mean that we have a lack of confidence in the Council or assume that funds are misspent. I do have a concern that the Council should give much more consideration to stronger cooperation with Parliament and collaboration between the three institutions. I will illustrate with an example. I am the rapporteur for real estate. It would be highly beneficial if the three institutions would coordinate with each other much better when it comes to buildings. The taxpayers would also be grateful, as perhaps then we could act more effectively and more in concert instead of as three institutions doing everything separately. The same applies, as I see it, to interpreters and other areas. We should work together. The general population can no longer be expected to understand how we do not even answer each other’s questions. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to thank Bulgaria and Romania for the impressive efforts that they have made. They have not only fulfilled the technical details of the Schengen Agreement, but have also taken very specific measures at their borders in order to safeguard the external borders of the European Union. The claim that they have only met the small-scale technical requirements is simply wrong. Everyone can go to these borders and see what Bulgaria and Romania have done to bring about a massive improvement in standards and in education and training and to see the measures that have been taken to secure the external borders. In my opinion, their efforts have been significantly underestimated. Secondly, the subject of corruption has repeatedly been mentioned, together with organised crime. I think it is right for us to discuss these matters and I also think it is right for us to take serious measures to combat corruption and organised crime within the context of the Schengen Agreement. However, laying the responsibility solely at the door of Bulgaria and Romania is wrong. There are also significant problems relating to corruption and organised crime within the Schengen countries. Therefore, against this background, and with regard to securing the external borders, I am calling specifically for the fulfilment of the Schengen Agreement in all the Member States to be evaluated, because it is necessary to ensure that all the Schengen countries meet the requirements, not only those which want to join. We need long-term safeguards and not simply short-term demands on two Member States. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur and Mr Klinz and, in particular, our coordinator Mr Karas, who has ensured that this is not only a balanced report, but also contains many passages that make worthwhile reading and that are essential for the future of the European Union and its 27 Member States. In today’s climate of global competition, it is no longer possible for every Member State to go it alone. I believe that competition is an important and necessary instrument. However, I also believe it is important for our 27 Member States to have joint strategies for the globalised financial markets and in relation to our major competitors on the other continents. I am not in favour of more Europe across the board, but I do advocate more Europe in areas where the 27 can only succeed by pooling their efforts. In this context, we have discussed key points in relation to the financial markets, pointing out, in particular, that we cannot achieve greater economic growth simply through financial trading, but rather that the answer lies in coordinated and sustainable economic activity. For this reason, I find this to be a very good report. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 – (DE)
 Mr President, I would like to raise two points in relation to cohesion policy and regional policy. The first is the dispute regarding the so-called intermediate category, which runs very much along national lines. I believe it is essential for us to consider the following points in relation to this discussion: regional policy and economic development policy must offer an incentive system so that the relevant regions can develop. If the system is set up in such a way that a dependency on continuous subsidy develops without requiring effort among the regions to obtain the relevant resources, then I believe that such an intermediate category would be an unmitigated disaster because it will always be a bone of contention and offers no rationale. However, I do believe that it makes sense for Objective 1 regions that lose their Objective 1 status to continue to receive special support. I also believe it makes sense that a region that is experiencing financial and economic difficulties for specific reasons should also receive support. What we do not want is a continuous subsidy mentality; instead we should offer help and support to the regions that need it. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by saying something about the comments on the House of European History. As rapporteur for buildings I would firstly like to say that the figure of EUR 136 million is definitely incorrect. Secondly, we are not talking about a prestige project here; after all, we are constantly complaining that people know nothing of European development since the Second World War, and we now want to make sure that two to three million people a year get to know these developments and find out more about them – so that perhaps they will be less Eurosceptic. We should debate together the level of the operating costs and the synergies that may be able to be realised with the information centre. A great many Members have taken part in the debate. However, the debate has only just become public, with the result that some Members do not yet feel they have been adequately informed. I will be happy to provide assistance with such discussions or requests for information. I consider the project to be necessary and useful, because people need to find out more about European development – otherwise there will be more and more Eurosceptics. Secondly, on the subject of development aid. I would first like to thank Mr Staes warmly for the fact that we have genuinely achieved a joint report in many, many respects that I can categorically support. I consider it essential that we set development aid priorities in the areas of infrastructure, health, education and particularly agriculture, and in particular I think that perhaps we should consider introducing an evaluation of projects after 10 years. It is not our aim to start only short-term projects that in the final event have no lasting effect. Moreover, we should make sure that we achieve better coordination of development aid with the Member States and also are able to implement once and for all the integration of the entire development aid budget into the EU budget, because it is incomprehensible why only part of our development aid is included in the EU budget. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Madam President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, the House’s budget for 2012 is set against the background of a difficult economic and financial situation. That is why I see it as a positive development that we have agreed in the basic guidelines that Parliament’s budget is to be drawn up carefully within the framework of only modest increases and that adjustments should not exceed the inflation rate. I believe the target mentioned by Mr Fernandes, in relation to youth employment is very important because in our last budget we were very concerned that more money should be provided for youth than was previously the case because it is young people in particular who are affected by unemployment or who need special support, including from Europe. That is why I believe the additional EUR 100 million is a very positive approach. As the rapporteur on buildings, I would particularly like to point out that I believe it is extremely important for us to maintain a high level of efficiency in relation to the financing of our buildings and to monitor the financial situation with care. In this context I believe it is right that financial resources that cannot be spent on Parliament’s budget over the course of the year should be used as prudently as possible to avoid interest payments. In this regard it is also necessary to ensure that the monies are not spent in a mad rush at the end of the year, but rather that they are used to pay off buildings more quickly and more economically. In relation to the House of European History, we shall ensure that the operating plan is carefully examined once again and that the construction costs are closely monitored so that, crucially, an orderly budget can also be presented after the building is complete following notification in accordance with Article 179(3). Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks for the many talks we were able to have with the rapporteur and also with the Commissioner and shadow rapporteurs. This enabled good compromises to be reached in some areas. As Mrs Malmström just mentioned, this includes the compromise on free legal assistance, in particular, for the special protection of minors. Other achievements include the fact that we were able to agree on which applicants were particularly worthy of protection and, in our talks with one another, we were able to find a sensible compromise. Over and above that, we also found a compromise with regard to the subject of safe third countries. The aim is to fundamentally improve the quality of the administrative procedures so that there are fewer hearings in court in the second and third instance, in order to provide asylum seekers who are genuinely facing persecution with as rapid and as consistently effective assistance and protection as possible. I am strongly in favour of there being appropriate minimum standards in all Member States. Unfortunately, however, both the Commission’s text and some of the individual amendments intended to amend the Commission’s text to a certain extent do the opposite of what this good intention is striving to achieve. Many opportunities have been created to delay procedures or even to massively abuse asylum law. I will give you a few examples of this. For example, an applicant can make three inadmissible applications and has the right to go through the full procedure three times. Only then can an accelerated procedure be carried out. A procedure cannot be accelerated if someone is clearly not recognised as a refugee under the Geneva Convention. In this regard, I would simply mention the subject of Tunisia and also that of economic migrants. Another example is the fact that an accelerated procedure will also not be possible if subsequent applications are made without any relevant new content. What I consider to be even more serious, however, is the subject of disappearing. If someone illegally disappears, his application can no longer be closed with a negative decision. He has to countersign the letter. Therefore, if an asylum seeker were expecting news of a negative decision, all he would need to do – if we were to adopt the motion put forward by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – would be to refuse to accept the letter or not be there to receive it. The consequence of that would be that he could prolong the procedure indefinitely. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE
).

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the 2012 budget is set against the background of a difficult economic and financial situation in the 27 Member States. For this reason, we will certainly not be able to afford to do everything that we would like to do. I believe that the report tabled by Mrs Balzani is a workable compromise. However, I also have a few critical remarks to make. In my opinion, more money does not necessarily mean more solidarity and more Europe. What is important is to improve the quality of what we get in return for the money spent and above all to ensure that the objectives we set ourselves are actually achieved rather than the money merely being paid out regardless. We must always examine the question of our potential new own resources with a critical eye, too. These own resources must not lead to the additional burdening of citizens or of businesses that need to be, and should be, able to compete with the rest of the world. I also think it is important for us not always to emphasise the fact that the EU budget amounts to only 2% because, at the end of the day, many States cofinance the corresponding European funds, thus, of course, making a considerably larger volume of funds available on the basis of EU programmes. I think it is particularly important for us to make progress in terms of research, education, sustainability and strengthening economic growth. In light of this, I think it is also important for large-scale projects such as ITER – and in this regard I would like to thank Mrs Jensen for her comment – to be fully and clearly financed and clearly managed, because otherwise the Americans, who are currently implementing the same project, will be appreciably ahead of us, and we Europeans should not always take second place. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to express my regret and dismay that neither the Secretary-General nor the two vice-presidents with responsibility for the European Parliament are present. We normally expect from the Commission that its responsible members should be present; we should also expect the same from our most senior representative. Secondly, I would like to address the subject of the management of the House’s buildings. I welcome the fact that the KAD project in Luxembourg is making progress, that it would seem that the costs are under control, and that things are going according to plan. When the KAD extension project is complete, bringing staff together under one roof should lead to greater efficiency and synergy, as well as reducing annual costs, because eight offices will be closed. It is essential that this target should be met as we need some of these funds for other purposes, as Mr Fernandes has pointed out. I believe that the House of European History is an important project because it will attract many visitors, who will be offered an insight into the significance, aims and purpose of the European Union in the context of European history in a very effective way. Thirdly, I would ask that the staff appointed in Luxembourg should be relocated to Brussels. Because they frequently need to work in Brussels, they are constantly travelling back and forth, also causing problems for the Members. This only applies to a small number of sub-areas and relocation really should be considered on efficiency grounds. Fourthly, I think it a very good thing that the European Parliament is only making provision for moderate expansion. The fact that other areas are only expanding on a modest scale should not be taken by the EEAS as a reason for massive expansion. I would call on all institutions to cut their cloth to their measure in these times of economic and financial difficulty. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, it is important that the EU comes to grips with the problems of migration and the right of asylum. The Commission has submitted proposals in this area. However, there is currently no accurate analysis of the implementation of existing legal provisions. There are also hardly any detailed calculations and analyses concerning the new proposals. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wholeheartedly supports the right of asylum and the right to protection for people who need it. However, when we look at the actual situation, it is unfortunately clear that people are applying for asylum for very different reasons or even systematically abusing the system. The right of asylum and subsidiary protection is not a tool for general migration into the 27 Member States. We must ensure that the organised people traffickers do not have the opportunity to make billions of euro in profit out of people’s fates as a result of our right of asylum. Asylum procedures must be fit for purpose and they must be implemented with great care. Victims of persecution must be guaranteed a refuge in the EU. This is why the Commission’s obligations in this respect are laid down in the new drafts. I think many of them are appropriate, including interpreters, proper healthcare and taking into consideration special protection needs. However, I would also like to mention the points which I believe are problematic. The authorities in the Member States are being given far too few opportunities to prevent abuse. The option of the accelerated procedure and the border procedure should be restricted by applying charges. If an applicant commits a serious breach of his duty of cooperation, there are very few possibilities of imposing sanctions. On the contrary, if an asylum seeker disappears, the Member State cannot bring the procedure to a negative conclusion. If he reappears, he is offered an extended range of procedural options. Even if an application is obviously without any foundation, the use of the accelerated procedure will only be possible after the second subsequent application. This will lead to significant cost increases. The current Commission draft states that free legal advice will be available from a lawyer, which will also result in the Member States’ costs rising considerably. I would simply like the Commission to reconsider the practical consequences of its proposals, the financial impact and the problems for the authorities in the Member States. We want to see a system with high standards, but it must be workable and should not present already overburdened Member States with completely impossible tasks. Monika Hohlmeier,  
author.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, thank you very much for allowing me to speak again briefly. I have a request for you, Mr Füle. I would like to start by saying that incorrect assumptions lead to incorrect cost estimates. At the moment, the number of asylum seekers is not falling, but rising significantly. This is a result of visa facilitation, for example, for Serbia and Macedonia. We are currently also seeing a massive increase in abuses of the asylum system as part of attempts to enter countries in the European Union. If you start with incorrect assumptions, in other words, that disputing the first instance in detail will save costs in subsequent instances, it will automatically seem as if all Member States have poor first-instance procedures. However, that is not the case. If overall standards are raised, the consequence will be cost increases. Improving the standard of quality for everyone and making the procedures more complex will, in reality, result in increased costs. I am more than happy to discuss this point. Therefore, I would like to ask you specifically to take the concerns of the countries seriously, because some of the practical reports from the countries have already been completed and will be distributed. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to make it clear, following repeated claims in this House, that during the budget negotiations, we have not requested a single cent more than the Council had offered us. This means that we were completely in line with the Council’s wishes. On the subject of the flexibility instrument, we need it because the Council regularly gets us into difficulties with its decisions on major projects for which it has not made provision for the funding. We then have to attempt, together with the Member States, to find a solution for these projects, in order to be able to support them financially and to make sensible plans. We have also not demanded more than what is laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. Instead, we are calling for compliance with the treaty. Nothing else, nothing more and nothing less. On the subject of own resources, it is surely not asking too much for Parliament to say that it would at least like to discuss the issue, what form it could take and whether own resources are in place. They cannot simply refuse to talk about this and then put the blame on Parliament. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, later on, we will be attending the reception for the deepening of relations between the European Union and the United States. The fact that this is happening today of all days is particularly significant. All of us will then have the opportunity to tell the ambassador what we have just underlined here in plenary. We ought to take the opportunity to do this in person. The United States of America is not making our work particularly easy at the moment, and it is not making our friendship very easy, either. On many issues, I have the impression that what we are seeing is more like a bull in a china shop than a performance on the elegant political stage. The EUR 14 alone is certainly not a decisive factor. However, if a family with three children wants to visit the United States of America, it then becomes a considerable amount and may ultimately prevent them from travelling there. On top of that, if you have to give extensive details on the Internet about which airline you are travelling with, where you are travelling to, which hotel you are staying in and, in addition, you have to give your credit card number, it raises a number of questions as to why all of this is necessary. If, in addition, you then hear the accounts of some good acquaintances who have had to wait for hours at American airports and experience the discourteous security control, then you sometimes ask yourself whether the United States of America is actually aware that in many areas, it is currently treating its own friends rather discourteously and perhaps, in certain respects in relation to what people actually need and have to do, it is way off the mark. Furthermore, with regard to our close transatlantic relations, I have to say that we do have a close relationship with the United States. However, this should also mean that we are treated accordingly. I call on the Commission and on you, Mr Šefčovič, to make a clear demand for visa-free travel to be ensured for those Member States that do not currently enjoy this facility, and if this is not followed by an appropriate reaction, then please also demand that reciprocity be introduced. It is not a question of ‘an eye for an eye’, but we must negotiate on equal terms and we must not allow ourselves to be treated in the same way that a feudal lord would treat his serfs. We are not serfs; we are of equal stature. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I note that the Council does not wish to debate the multiannual financial framework. May I tell the Council that the European Parliament would very much like to debate it, and that the Council cannot act as if it is in a kindergarten by telling us that it will not answer our questions or comment on our proposals. Secondly, in this connection, I must ask the Council whether it wants to have Lisbon or not. Lisbon is not a mere technical adjustment; it imposes more competences and means there are more responsibilities to discharge – and that includes answering related financial questions. Moreover, the Council has taken decisions that result in new financial expenditure. That has been mentioned by many of my fellow Members. If the Council wishes to do this, and if it does not want more money to be spent, then it must also state quite specifically where and how it wishes savings to be made, where exactly these funds are to be shifted from – and not simply propose general percentages to be redeployed while leaving Parliament and the Commission with the unpleasant task of deciding where the money is to be taken from, especially since our opportunities for redeployment and budgetary revision are extremely limited. The additional responsibilities that you have imposed on us are so challenging that they do not involve small incidental amounts – I will merely mention the area of the financial solidarity of our Member States and their corresponding financial difficulties. If the programme is to be implemented, then we are not taking about small sums that can be redeployed without further consideration. The same applies to ITER, the same applies to matters of internal security, the same applies to significant matters relating to research, the same also applies to questions concerning Parliament’s priority areas such as youth training and research. We have to deal not only with shortcomings in implementation, but also with a lack of transparency when it comes to the disbursement of funds. We need to debate and work through all these matters quite specifically; the Council cannot simply keep silent on them. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all of the Member States of the European Union are suffering under the burden of huge debts and from the effects of the financial and economic crisis. However, they are also suffering as a result of the fact that, for years, high budget deficits – some of which are excessive – have been accepted and tolerated in a large number of countries. When we start to tackle the new 2011 budget it is not enough merely to reduce the budgets of the Member States. We also need to undertake a thorough review of the expenditure from our budget and also carefully review new expenditure. I would mention the European External Action Service, the structure and also the financing of which is still extremely unclear. There is no transparent structure. I would also call for cost-efficiency by using the synergies with national external action services. There must be clear rules regarding responsibilities and a transparent rendering of accounts to the European Parliament, and attempts should not be made to void the European Parliament’s codecision and supervision roles in more and more decisions. The European Parliament is cooperative and will also be supportive in difficult situations. For this reason, we must also involve the European Parliament in these matters as co-decision-maker. Furthermore, I think it is necessary for us at last to make the reduction in bureaucracy a reality, for example in agriculture and also for small and medium-sized enterprises, which urgently need to grow and to implement and cope with innovations. If we want to reduce budgetary deficits, as well as taxes, and increase tax revenues, we need to reduce the burden of bureaucracy on small and medium-sized enterprises and enable innovation, and we must finally reduce the merciless competition exerted by large-scale industry on unpopular small and medium-sized enterprises, and not encourage it. I also share the view of the Chair of our Committee on Budgets that we first need precise data regarding this budget before we can finally adopt it. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to discuss the problems with development aid that are nearly always emphasised by the Court of Auditors and to thank Mrs Ayala Sender for her good cooperation that was remarkably pleasant. Firstly, there is often the problem of budget support. That means that there is even suspicion that in countries where we are trying to help the population a little, budget support is partly being used by corrupt and totalitarian regimes to suppress undesirable population groups or even critics. I am extremely critical of this budget support. It should be reduced or stopped for countries in which we clearly have problems with the use of budget support. Secondly, now as before, we have the problem that the payments often contain errors, that there is a lack of coordination and targeting of development aid projects between the different institutions and levels in one country and there is no recognisable setting of priorities. It is essential that this is made a matter of priority, so that we can improve the sustainability and effectiveness of projects in those countries where people really are in dire need. Furthermore, now as before, I consider it essential that development aid and the European Development Fund in general are integrated into the overall budget. On pre-accession aid for Turkey I would like to say that I was surprised that the completely normal criticism which, in other countries, would have long since led to the blocking and withholding of financing, has led so quickly to a hiccup in the cooperation between Turkey and the Commission. I consider it completely normal that we firstly lay down the strategy and the goals, then the timeframes, the project orientation, the yardsticks for measuring and then the method of performance monitoring. However, if all of this is lacking and projects are implemented that are then declared successful, I have a problem with the way the programme is implemented. For this reason, I personally consider it necessary that at least part of the funding is withheld until it we have suitable assurances that the funds will be properly spent. We have now reached a compromise, but I consider it necessary to monitor the problem, since other countries like Bulgaria, Romania or Greece will be affected. I think it is necessary that everyone be treated in the same way and not differently. Therefore, I ask that in the area of buildings policy, provision be made for a medium-term building strategy by means of clear construction and financial planning. Large projects should receive their own budget lines and a reporting system related to construction progress, and we should not pay any more costs for bridging lenders. As we are such large institutions, we need buildings and they must be planned carefully and transparently. My last point is that I believe it is necessary to simplify the programmes as a matter of urgency, since that is how problems in the respective countries arise, and this must not simply remain a rhetorical demand, but must finally be implemented. (Applause) Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unlike the previous speaker, I would expressly like to thank both Commissioner Malmström and Commissioner Reding for their intensive efforts to take up the issues that have been raised by Parliament, as well as the problems that we see and have seen in the area of data security and confidentiality, in order to negotiate with the United States. I am also grateful that key issues – as mentioned by my fellow Members – have already been analysed or considered in the mandate and that, in particular, this also includes issues in the area of inspection as well as the area of reciprocity. On the matter of the erasure of data, I also consider it very important to be able to renegotiate the five-year period, since it is really not acceptable to hold data for such a long time. I also feel it is important to ultimately discuss the matter of penalties in cases of deliberate extraction to the wrong ends in sensitive circumstances, since that prevents certain things being extracted that we do not want to see extracted. The focus should only be on terrorism. To me, what is also important is the idea that we have to tackle our own TFTP and that in the longer term, we cannot transfer bulk data, that is to say, large amounts of data to the United States. That has nothing to do with mistrust, but the fact that in the long term, we ultimately want to take our own responsibility within Europe on an equal footing, and then exchange specific extracted data for the sole purpose of combating terrorism and finally maintain real reciprocity. In this context, I would again like to ask the Commission to indicate how the topic of our own TFTP is viewed within the Commission and in the joint discussion with the Council.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am astonished by the discussion on the part of fellow Members who, on the one hand, speak of simplifications for small and medium-sized enterprises, but who, when it comes to taking the very first step for micro-entities – and that is all we are talking about today, not about any other scale – are already inclined to say no again. We cannot always demand something and then subsequently say no. I have spoken with many micro-entities. They are hoping and waiting for this regulation. I have spoken to regional banks, who stressed very clearly to me that it would not be a problem for them at all if financial reporting was changed; they use other data any way. Furthermore, there will be absolutely no change in terms of transparency, because – as the Commissioner has explained – provisions will remain in force so that transparency is also maintained. Trade will not be affected, because the micro-entities do not have an impact on the European market in the sense of trading throughout Europe. I call on fellow Members to take this step with us and thank Mr Lehne and the committee for their excellent work. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 My decision to vote against the interim SWIFT agreement is not a decision against cooperation with the USA on combating terrorism. I emphatically advocated that a new, compatible agreement that would allow European and US security authorities to work closely together and enable them to detect money transfers with suspected links to terrorism should be created as swiftly as possible. However, there are major flaws in the interim agreement, including inadequate provisions as regards data deletion, rights of complaint and access to information and onward transmission to third parties. Moreover, what I expect from a genuine partnership between the European Union and the USA is one which does not merely leave the responsibility for ensuring security of citizens within the framework of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (TFTP) in US hands, but which also provides a clearly defined time-frame for the development of a European TFTP, in partnership with the USA, within the European Union, as well. For this reason, I hope that an agreement will be negotiated, in the nearest future, which still provides a long-term basis for jointly combating terrorism worldwide, in terms of detecting terrorist networks and their financial transactions, but which respects citizens’ data privacy, as well.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the focus until now has been on the cohesion fund and this is certainly justified because of the size of the budget. However, I would now like to draw attention to an area in which only EUR 2.7 billion was spent last year, but which causes significant problems. The European Court of Auditors, which I would like to thank warmly at this point, has produced a semi-masterpiece, as it has succeeded in bringing transparency to the fragmented administration in the area of development aid and in clearly identifying the problems which continue to occur. I would not like to go as far as saying that this area has no universal principle and no transparent structures, but it does have considerable problems. There have been improvements, for example, in the payments for projects, but nevertheless it is still the case that no audits can be carried out on some of the projects because the receipts are missing, not to mention the fact that some receipts are not even provided in the first place or that there are no opportunities for follow-up audits. The subject of budget aid once again involves particular problems because it is not possible to follow up or trace the money and what it is used for. In my opinion, we should carefully consider finally integrating the European Development Fund (EDF) into the general budget, for reasons of transparency, traceability and manageability. This would allow us to combine and coordinate the EDF with other fields, such as development aid, foreign policy, neighbourhood policy and other policies in the same area, so that we could obtain a complete and transparent overview. This is my proposal.Albert Deß,

 Mr President, Ms Reding, ladies and gentlemen, a secure supply of sugar for the European market must be the top priority of European sugar policy. The reform of the sugar regime in 2006 made the European Union dependent on imports, at least in part. Ms Reding has just mentioned the figures. The result of the reform is that imports amounting to 15% of consumption are now needed on a permanent basis. However, after the imports fell below expected levels because of poor harvests in some important sugar producing countries and the resulting rise in world market prices, the Commission has, in my opinion, taken the right measures. It has made importing additional amounts of sugar easier. More than 500 000 tonnes have been imported without duty being paid. It has also enabled domestic producers of sugar and isoglucose to sell part of their non-quota production on the food market. The amount in this case is also 500 000 tonnes. Against this background, it is clear that the Commission has achieved the balance referred to in the questions. I very much support what Ms Reding has said in this respect. The sugar market regime has the necessary instruments to secure the supply and to guarantee a fair balance across the different interests. The risk of redundancies has been mentioned, in particular, by the first speaker, and I would like to refer to what Mr Tarabella said. Thousands of jobs were lost during the reform of the sugar regime. In my constituency in the Upper Palatinate area of Germany, one of the oldest sugar refineries in Europe was closed with the loss of hundreds of jobs. Our goal must not be to ensure that every single job is secure, despite the fact that I regret every redundancy. Instead, we must ensure that there is a balance. I believe it will be good for the sugar regime reform to be extended until 2020. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Albert Deß  (PPE

Thank you, Ms Ludford. In the past, we had excessively high sugar prices in Europe. During the reform of the sugar regime in 2006 and also beforehand, sugar beet prices in Europe fell by around 40%. This meant that sugar beet producers suffered massive cuts. There have been major fluctuations in prices on the world market. There was a time when sugar was much more expensive on the world market than in Germany. At that point, none of the African, Caribbean and Pacific states were supplying Europe. The problem was that there were inconsistencies. Ms Ludford, if we in Europe abolish the sugar regime, we will be even more exposed to fluctuations in prices and European consumers will have to pay a bitter price. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, as one of the few people in this Chamber to have actually been a lorry driver myself, I voted against this today, even though Mr Higgins has done some good work. There were two main reasons for this. Firstly, it was because Parliament voted in favour of Amendment 134, which lowered the tonnage limit of the vehicles from 3.5 tonnes to 2.8 tonnes. I consider that excessive; it was not necessary. Above all, in the end I voted against the motion because Amendment 129 was rejected. This amendment called for the radius for approved exemptions to be extended to 150 kilometres. I am from the Upper Palatinate. Munich is 130 kilometres away. My tradesmen work in Munich a great deal, and now they have to install tachographs because they work in Munich. I am particularly annoyed that the only other Member from the Upper Palatinate region, Ismail Ertug, voted against the interests of tradesmen in our region on these two points. I have great hopes that this will be corrected again at second reading, so that tradesmen who work in areas some distance away from their own will not be disadvantaged. Albert Deß  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner Dalli, I am very pleased that you are here because I know that you are always sympathetic to our concerns. It is very good that you should be made aware of the problems of milk producers. Opinions differ on the milk quota, even within my own group. I often find myself in agreement with my colleague from Luxembourg, Ms Lulling, however we differ on this point. We, the nine representatives of the German conservative group (CSU) from the last electoral term, already voted en bloc against increasing the quota in 2008. The esteemed Commissioner at the time, Ms Fischer Boel, understood the term ‘soft landing’ to mean an increasing of the quota. Increasing the quota means more volume and more volume means lower prices. This is a fairly simple formula. This is precisely the problem we are faced with at present because there are farmers in the European Union who are delivering too much quota, causing a distortion in the milk market. I am against reducing the super levy or increasing the quota even further, because dairy farmers also need some contractual security. The quota will be phased out on 31 March 2015 and we need contractual security by then. We also need other important systems, Mr Dalli: fixed payment deadlines, net-net prices and binding supply volumes. These are the key points we need to work on in order to prepare for a market without quotas. Albert Deß  (PPE
),  
Blue-card question.

 Mr Ferreira, I have just one brief supplementary question: Did you know that in 2008, when the Council discussed increasing the quota, Portugal also voted in favour of this expansion and that only two countries were against increasing the quota, namely Germany and Austria? France abstained from voting. Twenty-four countries, including Portugal, voted to increase the quota, thereby undermining the quota system. Albert Deß  (PPE
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, thank you; I asked to speak because we still have some time left. I will be brief. I would like everyone who talks about the absolute freedom of the milk market, whether from my own group or from other groups, to take the following to heart: from 2015 onwards we shall also have to discontinue the historical payments per hectare. We cannot have a situation where milk producers in Latvia receive EUR 100 per hectare, while producers in other countries receive over EUR 1 000 on the basis of historical premiums. This does not constitute fair competition. A milk producer who receives compensation payments of EUR 1 000 per hectare can sell his milk to the market at a lower price, thus distorting the market. That cannot be allowed to happen. Starting from 2015, we must pay the same hectare premiums for all milk producers in the first pillar. We can expect some interesting discussions. My second comment relates to the market: we need to strengthen the position of producers and processors in relation to the retail sector. I fully support this. We cannot have a situation where milk producers and processors have to pay premiums and listing discounts and payments are delayed by periods of up to 100 days. Commissioner Dalli, we need to step in here to strengthen the position of producers and dairy farmers as a whole. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Albert Deß  (PPE

 Thank you for your question, Mr Bové. I myself am the president of a large dairy cooperative that markets milk for 7 000 dairy farmers and only the dairy farmers themselves have a say in the business, in other words the directors and the members of the supervisory board are all farmers. Unfortunately, we do not have enough leverage in the market to impose our prices on these wholesale chains. What we find particularly disturbing, and what causes prices to drop, are the unfair methods employed by others. There are no net-net prices. Discounts have to be given at the end of the year. Listing fees are demanded in the interim. In other words, it is impossible to compare the prices paid by the retailers because they are undermined by these systems. The Commission should look for clear-cut systems that would make the whole system more transparent and easier to understand. This would also allow us to protect our own interests more effectively.

Blue-card answer.

Mr President, I believe that the present problem is not that we do not have enough milk, but rather that we have too much. The problem is that some farmers are supplying much more than their quota permits. The aim of Ms Lulling and a number of other colleagues is to abolish or reduce the super levy. I disagree with them on this. This provision lasts up to 2015 and a number of dairy producers have spent money in recent months in order to purchase quotas. These people would be penalised if we were now to do away with the entire system. We must provide contractual security. Contractual security means that the status quo must be maintained until 2015, in other words that any force the quota may still have should remain in place until then. We need to consider what market measures we take after 2015. I must say that my dairy cooperative of 7 000 farmers is preparing well for 1 April 2015 and I have also advised dairy farmers to do likewise. Albert Deß  (PPE

Mr President, the subject of compensation payments that we are debating today is a very important one for our farmers in the areas concerned. I would like to point out here that the compensation payments are a success story in European agricultural policy. They have helped the management of the land to continue throughout these areas, where the biodiversity of the cultural landscape has been safeguarded and the jobs of people in these areas have been retained. This has meant that people in these areas continue to have prospects. I therefore find the way that the Commission as well as the Council have dealt with this sensitive matter even more incomprehensible. If we consider these eight biophysical criteria, we see that we will gain new inequities that are significantly worse than those under the current system, in which there are a few delimitation problems. We would have a system that would probably cause a great deal of anger. Details have leaked from Germany indicating that 2.8 million hectares would be removed and 1.2 million new hectares would be included in their place. When I speak to farmers from these areas, they are surprised that they should suddenly be in a Less-Favoured Area. From France, we hear that an area where farmers have the highest average income is to become a less-favoured area. This just does not add up. I would ask the Council whether it is prepared to work with Parliament in the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon so that we can draw up better proposals. Sometimes all I can say, with a certain amount of irony, is: I think as Parliament we need to make a few copies of the Treaty of Lisbon available to the Council and the Commission so that they finally catch on in all areas that this Treaty exists. It appears that many of them are not yet aware of this. Since the whole business really does already resemble a comedy show, as Mr Jahr put it, I would like to make another suggestion. We should declare the area in which the Commission and the Council meet to be a Less-Favoured Area, because they are withholding more than 66% of the information from us. Albert Deß,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to Ms Corazza Bildt and the other Member for the fact that this subject is on the agenda. Not everything is certain, but a hundred years ago we had almost exclusively local production, and products were brought to market in their local area. Today, the situation is quite different. I have here an interesting announcement from the German Federal Ministry of Agriculture, which has discussed precisely what the Commissioner was just saying, namely that it is already possible to entertain regional showcases and regional origin. According to the statement, the Federal Minister for the Economy Ilse Aigner is looking to launch regional labelling in Germany at a Federal/Länder
 summit in April. She says that she is now going to bring forward an initial plan for a new regional showcase for food packaging. The aim would be to put in place clear and transparent labelling for regional products. The labelling is to be voluntary initially, and will aim to make the origin of the product and the most important ingredients transparent. The results of a survey are also interesting. Seventy-nine per cent of consumers are prepared to pay more for regional foods, but only 17% feel reliably informed about the origin of regional foods. Herein lies the major problem, therefore. According to one survey, 83% of respondents in Germany already pay attention to which region a foodstuff comes from. There then follows an interesting statement: according to the Minister, there is no requirement either for a new national legal basis or for notification via the Commission in order to for such a regional showcase to be introduced. In other words, the Member States already have the latitude to act in this way. Nonetheless, the Commission needs to provide greater clarity in this area. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Thank you for your question, Mr Jahr. The reality, Commissioner, is that the Commission, too, needs to consider whether we do not need to lay down other criteria. I had an experience a few years ago, where I had to fight in the Commission in order to help a Bavarian slaughterhouse to survive. What did the Commission official over there have to say about it? He said, ‘Well, it’s no problem if it closes, there’s another slaughterhouse 60 kilometres away in Austria.’ We cannot promote regional products with that mindset. There therefore needs to be a broad-based change of attitude so that regional products, too, can be offered. In addition, we need the Commission to reconsider a few pieces of legislation that play a part in ensuring that this is no longer possible. Albert Deß,

 Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for the current debate in relation to the disease in animals caused by what is being referred to as the Schmallenberg virus. According to scientists, the virus has much in common with the Akabane virus, which has been familiar for some time now in animals from Africa to Japan and Australia. The Akabane virus is harmless to humans, so that it can be assumed that the Schmallenberg virus likewise poses no threat to humans. The virus is a major danger to animals, however, and can cause enormous economic damage. Commissioner, we need to do all we can to halt the spread of this disease and perhaps even to eradicate it. In order to be able to take effective steps, there is an urgent need for mandatory reporting throughout the European Union, something that has already been agreed in Germany at federal level. As we have already heard, the virus is transmitted by biting insects and it is very difficult to protect animals from such sources of infection. Effective protection is actually only possible through the use of an appropriate vaccine. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would call on the Commission to do all in its power to speed up the development of a corresponding vaccine, so that it becomes available as soon as possible. It is also important that the Commission should organise for this data to be recorded quickly, so that the relevant data is available and the necessary measures are implemented. It is also a matter for the Commission to achieve the lifting of the trade restrictions imposed by Russia on 20 March, as already called for. I have heard reports that, as well as Russia, Ukraine, Egypt, Algeria, Mexico and the US have already imposed initial trade restrictions. The faster we act, the sooner we can prevent the further spread of this disease and perhaps even eradicate it. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank Mr Nicholson for this report, which he wrote and on which he also led the negotiations in the trialogue. I would also like to thank all those who helped to bring this compromise about. Commissioner, the direction is the right one, but the impact in the Member States will vary enormously. In Germany, this dairy package will have hardly any impact. We already have producer associations under our Market Structure Act. Many farmers in Germany are organised into cooperatives, which means that they already jointly market their milk and dairy products. Contractual dealings in Germany are regulated by statute. In the private sector, we even already have these supply contracts. Unfortunately, this dairy package will not enable us to solve fundamental problems. This dairy package regulates dealings between producers and dairies. The biggest problem that I see, however, is in the relationship between the dairies and the retailers. This is not some kind of accusation against the parties involved. Nor, as landowners, are we responsible for this, but I ask you, Commissioner, to use your influence in the Commission to ensure that we regulate further issues on the basis of this dairy package, for example the issue of terms of payment for dairy products. It is not acceptable for farmers to deliver products to dairies – fresh milk expires after three days – and for the chain stores to only pay up after 60 or 80 days. Regulation is needed here. A second point is the listing fees, the discounts, that have to be granted here. We need binding net-net prices in the dairy sector so that transparency prevails in the sector. The supply volume rules are not binding, the length of contract with fixed prices between dairies and retail must be regulated. There is thus still much to do. However, my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), will certainly be voting in favour of this dairy package with a large majority. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Bové for his report and Ms Patrão Neves for the initiative for this motion for a resolution today. There are two developments that are worrying me. The first of these, Commissioner, is the growing gap between input and farm gate prices. The second is the situation right throughout the supply chain. Commissioner, I have just looked this up. On 27 July 1961, aged 14, I got my licence to drive a tractor, and my first job was to take grain to the brewery. At that time, 100 kg cost the equivalent of EUR 25. On my way home, I bought a newspaper, which cost me the equivalent of EUR 0.05. Today, cereal costs not EUR 25, but EUR 20, while the newspaper costs EUR 0.70 instead of EUR 0.05. If grain prices had followed the same trajectory as newspaper prices, consumers would now have to pay EUR 350 for 100 kg. You can see from these figures what Europe’s farmers are providing and what contribution they have made to giving our consumers cheap prices for food. What annoys me, and I am personally the chair of a farming cooperative, is the issue of terms of payment. Given the time constraints, I will limit myself to that. It has become a bad habit for the supermarket chains to saddle these farming cooperatives with ever longer payment terms. Once upon a time, it was 24 days. Now, even in Germany, it is often 60. In other words, if we deliver fresh milk, we make 30 deliveries before we get payment for the first one. Commissioner, there is an urgent need for action in this regard. We need to tackle these payment terms in the same way as we tackled roaming charges. That is the only way this situation will be rectified. I beg you to take action. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, Mr Sawicki, ladies and gentlemen, along with several Member States, you, Mr Cioloş, and you, Mr Sawicki, have spoken out in favour of continuing food aid for needy people. As we have heard, a political decision is required to ensure that this takes place. However, the responsibility for this important area lies primarily with the Member States. It is not acceptable that people in Europe do not have enough to eat. It is part of the social responsibility of the Member States to ensure that they do. In Germany there are laws which guarantee sufficient food for all the citizens of the country. The ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union has changed the framework of the current aid programme. Strict limits have been set on market purchases. The Court has determined that the current programme in its current form does not comply with the legal basis of the Treaties. I know that we need to find answers in order to guarantee that the millions of needy people in the EU are given help. However, I would like to stress once again that the socio-political responsibility lies with the Member States. Perhaps we should also consider whether it would be better to establish programmes in the Member States rather than one European programme. These would be cofinanced with social funding from Brussels, in order to guarantee the provision of food aid in all Member States. This would also safeguard European solidarity, which I am firmly committed to, and enable the programmes to be continued. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will certainly help to find solutions for the people who are affected. I was once travelling in Brazil with a group of people when some young Brazilians asked us if they could have the food that we had left on our plates. I was shocked that something like this could happen in a rich agricultural country. We must make sure that people in Europe have enough to eat. Albert Deß,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 50 years ago, in 1961, I began my training to be a farmer. Ever since then, I have been guided by the common European agricultural policy. It has become an important mainstay of the European unification process. Since the beginning of the CAP there have been fundamental changes to its tasks. The first task was to increase food production in order for us to be less dependent on food imports. Sometime later, Europe was in the position of having to deal with food surpluses. With an ever-changing situation, there were also more and more reforms. Today, we are debating the next reform, the new approach of the CAP after 2013. As rapporteur for the CAP reform towards 2020, I am pleased that we have achieved a cross-group compromise. Even if not all of the individual interests could be taken into account in a compromise, the report was adopted with a large majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. The clear vote is an unambiguous signal to the Commission of the form that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development sees the CAP taking towards 2020. I am certain, Commissioner, that the new approach of the CAP after 2013 will also bear the stamp of the European Parliament. The Treaty of Lisbon gives us that possibility. My thanks today go to my fellow Members for their involvement and support, and to the committee chair Mr De Castro, the coordinators and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and willingness to compromise. I would like to thank the staff of the committee secretariat, the political groups and in my own private office for their splendid cooperation. Turning to the report now: food safety and the security of supply for half a billion people remain the main goals of the common agricultural policy, not only in the EU, but also worldwide. The CAP is intended to be sustainable and competitive, to supply consumers with safe, high-quality food and also to promote renewable forms of energy. The two-pillar structure of the CAP is to remain so as to create certainty of planning for our farmers for this next period. The report clearly states – and here we support the Commissioner – that the agricultural budget should remain at the current level in the next financial period. I cannot understand President Barroso’s statement that massive cuts are to be made in the second pillar. I believe that there will be cross-group opposition to this. The simplification of the common agricultural policy remains an important task. That is a core demand of our compromise. We are also calling for a fair distribution among the Member States. That is also necessary in order to create a level playing field in terms of competition. We are seeking to move away from historical and individual references towards area-based premiums. The role of small farmers is to be recognised and, on the basis of subsidiarity, the Member States are to decide themselves how to support these small farmers. The importance of young farmers is mentioned. From my point of view, it was important to avoid introducing a new additional payment system that would lead to extra control and sanction systems for greening. Overall, we have found a compromise that many Members will be able to support tomorrow so that we can send out a clear signal as regards the new approach of this agricultural policy. A large majority of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will support this report. Albert Deß,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank everyone for this intense debate, and also for the support that I have been given here. Commissioner, we are all looking forward to your communication in October and then to good, positive cooperation. European agriculture is a positive factor. It feeds more than 500 million people, farms and looks after more than 170 million hectares of arable land and pasture, it provides many jobs in areas upstream and downstream, is an important buttress of rural areas and is already the most sustainable agricultural sector in the world. I therefore cannot understand why President Barroso has spoken of huge cuts in the second pillar. In so doing he is also jeopardising the EU2020 goals – in other words, his own goals. When 14 million farmers are feeding 500 million people, is it too much to ask that European agricultural policy be used to ensure that the 500 million people also provide properly for the 14 million farmers, so to speak? Here I should like to emphasise – as has been mentioned a couple of times today already – that there have been departures from my original report on some matters. I have been in the political game too long, and I know exactly why I drafted the report as I did. Had I written the report as it stands today, what would I have had to offer in the compromise negotiations? I allowed enough margin to ensure that everyone could be pacified, and a good result has been achieved today. My report therefore had a substantial buffer. The result I wanted to achieve was for us to send a signal as Parliament that we are addressing the important aspects that are necessary if European farmers are to have a good future. Once the legislative proposals are on the table, Commissioner, we will then work intensively to achieve a good outcome together. I can already assure you that you are likely to have greater support here in Parliament than some other commissioners would have. We are able to offer you that. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, back when I was a child, I received letters from what was then Rhodesia. Three of my grandfather’s sisters were Catholic nuns in the then Rhodesia and in South Africa. They never wrote of the people of Rhodesia having to go hungry. What we hear from this country today is simply intolerable. Rhodesia, and later Zimbabwe, were the bread basket of southern Africa. Mr Mugabe – a communist socialist dictator – has managed to turn this bread basket into a famine zone. I would like to thank all the fellow Members who have put this matter back on the agenda. It is intolerable that this dictator, Mr Mugabe, has been allowed to terrorise the people of Zimbabwe for so long. I believe that the key to ending this lies in southern Africa. I regret to say that for as long as South Africa fails to put this dictator in his place, he will continue to terrorise his people. Albert Deß,

 Madam President, Commissioner, thank you Commissioner for the factual presentation of this dioxin scandal in Germany. It makes me extremely angry, including in my capacity as a farmer, that again and again, we have to deal with scandals of this kind where the cause can seemingly be attributed to carelessness, but also to criminal activity. We can put as many laws and regulations in place as we like – in Europe, we have some of the most stringent laws on the production of food and we have the lowest limit values for ingredients that could harm the health of our consumers – but still we are not immune to such dangers. That is why it must also be a requirement – and the Member States are also responsible for this – that if the public prosecutor determines that criminal activity is involved, the magnitude of the penalty must be increased substantially. Such people must not get off with a fine – prison sentences are called for here. They must be put away so that they cannot cause such a disaster again. Commissioner, I am very pleased that you have acknowledged that the German authorities took the appropriate sequence of measures – that was also my impression in Germany. There was a certain amount of political commotion about the matter not being dealt with correctly. We all need to get together and, where necessary, supplement the strict provisions that we have in place. You mentioned one particular matter with regard to which you have our full support. I, too, am in favour – and I am also speaking on behalf of my group – of the introduction of the strict segregation of food production from the production of other products to prevent such mix ups from happening. You have our support, Commissioner, when it comes to improving our provisions and regulations further to enable us to better prevent such scandals in future. Albert Deß,

Madam President, Mr Cioloş, I am pleased that you are here today to answer questions. On 18 May, the European Parliament adopted with a large majority a resolution to simplify the common agricultural policy (CAP). Of course, it has not been possible for you to implement this resolution yet, but I would like to ask you, Mr Cioloş, to take into consideration all the demands made in this motion for a resolution when you begin restructuring agricultural policy. Unfortunately, I have to point out one fly in the ointment. I have just had a discussion with a group of farmers who were concerned that your proposals for the first pillar, Mr Cioloş, would not reduce the amount of red tape, but could instead lead to a huge increase in bureaucracy. The European Union cannot be held responsible for every piece of red tape, Mr Cioloş. A large proportion of the responsibility lies with the Member States. This is why I am asking you to ensure that we can work together on the forthcoming reform so that it is structured in such a way that it can be implemented with as little administrative and supervisory effort as possible. This will allow farmers to focus on their main job, in other words, producing food, rather than requiring them to check the current legislation to find out what they need to be aware of before they do anything out in their fields or their barns. In no other agricultural area in the world are farmers burdened with so many requirements and regulations as in the European Union. You are not yet responsible for this, Mr Cioloş. You have the chance to be the first Commissioner – before you eventually step down, and I do not know when that will happen – who can say that during his period of office, the amount of bureaucracy has been reduced rather than increased. As the rapporteur for agricultural reform, I would like to offer you the opportunity to work together with us to find a solution, so that this goal can be achieved. Albert Deß,

 Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, today’s motion for a resolution will help to set the European livestock sector on the right course. I would like to thank Mrs García for this initiative. The objective of the motion is not to cut Europe off from the rest of the world or to override the rules of the market. Its aim is to put in place fair market conditions for the European livestock industry, which will help to ensure food security for more than 500 million people in future. We must ensure that the European agricultural sector is not confronted with new and highly detailed production regulations on a daily basis and that farmers are not required to provide one certificate of competence after another, while maintaining high animal welfare and environmental standards. Rules of this kind apparently do not apply to imported agricultural products. Therefore, I am grateful to all the 534 Members of this House who voted in Strasbourg in favour of requiring agricultural imports to comply with European consumer protection, animal welfare and environmental protection standards in future. Mr Cioloş, Parliament is ready to give you its full support. These standards must be applied to imports and this is why my group welcomes and supports this motion. Albert Deß  (PPE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all those who worked on this report. Overall, their work has resulted in a good report. During the debate, it has become clear to me that the situation across Europe varies greatly. There are Member States in which a few large concerns dominate the market, and – thankfully – there are also Member States in which there are still many small retailers. There is just as much variation in the situation as regards food prices. There are Member States in which the price of food has risen substantially in recent times, and there are Member States – such as my home country of Germany – where there is merciless competition between enterprises and food prices are constantly being lowered, to the detriment of farmers. Our main concern is to call on the Commission and the Member States to review the situation and to take appropriate measures to allow farmers to add value in the food supply chain. The report also contains some very specific demands, however. I only have time to mention a few here, such as the call in paragraph 30 for a specified payment period. It is not acceptable that farmers, small businesses and cooperatives are providing short-term financing for major concerns. That is the job of the banks; it is not a job for farming cooperatives. Listing fees – as they are known – must also be investigated, Commissioner. We need a uniform regulation on this throughout Europe if we are to ensure competition. If we are to guarantee the food supply of 500 million people in the EU, then we must have fair competition for our farmers in Europe, as called for in the report. There is one more thing I would like to mention, which is that members of my group have asked for certain paragraphs to be voted on separately. As democrats, we have to accept that, but I am assuming that the vast majority of my group will vote in favour of most paragraphs so that we can achieve fair conditions for our farmers.

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, today sees an important debate on George Lyon’s report and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Lyon sincerely for the willingness to compromise that he showed in this document. We have managed to reach a good compromise that can be supported by many groups and I am hopeful that this compromise will be supported by a broad majority in the vote to take place at noon today. The common agricultural policy in Europe was and is one of the most important pillars of the European unification process. In this report we describe the effects of the common agricultural policy post 2013. The European agricultural sector produces high-quality food, protects vital rural areas and many jobs, maintains and promotes our cultural landscape and biodiversity and can make a contribution to conserving fossil fuels through the production of renewable raw materials and energy. To ensure that European agriculture can continue to perform these functions into the future, we must find a concept for the period post 2013 that will enable it to fulfil these many tasks. I welcome the fact that Commissioner Cioloş has clearly indicated that he wishes to see a continuation of a two-pillar system. My group will support this. The first pillar acts as a balance to the constraints under which European agriculture operates in relation to other agricultural regions in the world, while the second pillar involves the creation of a catalogue of measures to enable the 27 Member States to ensure that agriculture receives additional aid to enable it to fulfil its functions. The vast majority of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will vote in favour. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, clearly the Mercosur countries are important trading partners for us. However, Commissioner, this trade with the Mercosur countries should not be allowed to become a one-way street. The frequent claims made in public that Europe is closing itself off in the agricultural markets are quite wrong. We purchase over 90% of African agricultural exports and 45% of Central and South American agricultural exports. Europe is certainly not closed off to external trade. What I would criticise, Commissioner, is the information policy pursued. It has not been good. As an agricultural policymaker, I first learned that these negotiations had begun when I opened the newspapers. In future we should not have to rely on the press for our information. I urge you to inform the agricultural sector represented here in Parliament about the progress of negotiations. Another point I would criticise is the fact that the objective here is free trade that is not based on standards. How can it be that we demand high standards of consumer protection, animal protection and environmental protection in Europe, but do not require the same standards from imports? Let me offer just one example in this regard. Last year, Parliament passed the most stringent plant protection product legislation in the world. Many active ingredients are prohibited in Europe. Commissioner, we cannot have a situation in the future where food is supplied to Europe from countries in which active ingredients are used that are prohibited in Europe for reasons of consumer protection. Consumer protection is inviolable and we would do well to remember this in negotiations. Then we have nothing to fear from our competitors, and we European farmers will stand our ground against this competition. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased that the report on specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union has been so amicably discussed in the House. In the last electoral term, I was the shadow rapporteur for reform of the sugar market. At that time, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development visited the island of Réunion where I visited a small agricultural holding that grows sugar cane. Without our support, this small agricultural holding could not stay in existence. As someone from the continental mainland, I also observed that these farmers in the outermost regions of the Union do face a special set of circumstances. It is necessary for us to ensure, through certain rules on exceptions, that we offer these farmers in all these regions that are in the European Union future prospects and ensure that they are able to guarantee food security – at least for the most part – in these areas. It is up to us all to help ensure that agriculture – including through these rules on exceptions – has future prospects and that the security of supply for the local population is safeguarded. The way the report has now been drawn up provides good conditions for achieving these goals. My heartfelt thanks go to all those who have been involved. Albert Deß  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I have voted against the motion for a resolution, because in my opinion, it is lacking some important data. Recently, there has been an increasing number of reports of climate scientists having faked data. It is important for us to discuss this and make our opinions known. In order to ensure that there is no misunderstanding, I would like to explain that I have been committed for many years to reducing our use of fossil fuels and, therefore, our impact on the environment. However, I cannot understand the scaremongering that has been associated with the phrase ‘climate change’. I have experienced a great deal in my long career as a politician. In the early 1980s, people said that there would be no trees left in Germany by 2000, but Germany is greener than it has ever been. It is true that the climate is changing, but this has been happening throughout history and will continue to do so in future. For this reason, I have voted against this motion for a resolution.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, last year, and this year, too, dairy farmers made their concerns known very loudly, including in Brussels. The impression you get from the media is that it is only the dairy farmers that are in a difficult situation. The fact is that other farming sectors are also affected by this. In contrast to our dairy farmers, the pig producers, pig fatteners, poultry farmers, fruit and vegetable growers, wine growers and even cereal farmers are used to there being good and bad years and therefore do not make their voices heard so loudly. Nevertheless, I think that it is good for us to highlight the situation of these farmers today, too. Commissioner, you said that the financial and economic crisis has affected the whole of the agricultural sector and that we ought to consider how we can respond to this. When talking with the farmers affected on the ground, I hear the same things again and again: by and large, they say they are coping with the markets, apart from situations where it is extremely difficult, like it was last year and is this year for the dairy farmers and others. However, what the farmers do not understand is that we in Europe are burdening them with ever more red tape. They say that they want to work their land and feed and care for their animals rather than spend the whole day keeping books and records about what they are doing. For centuries, our farmers have produced food without keeping vast quantities of records. The yields on the land have increased, the performance of the animals has improved and today, we inundate our farmers with red tape. I have recently read that the agricultural ministers are discussing a reduction in red tape. Our farmers hardly dare believe this anymore. I hope that we can finally make some progress on this and allow our farmers to do what they do best, in other words, produce food – healthy food for half a billion people. We should support them in so doing and ensure that they are able to achieve this in future. Albert Deß,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, Commissioner, it is important for us in the European Parliament to discuss the subject of hunger in the world. We cannot simply sit silently by while the number of people suffering from hunger, which includes many children, increases. I was first elected to a parliament 20 years ago and I can still remember well how international organisations such as the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, the United Nations itself and the World Trade Organisation stated their intention of halving hunger in the world within the next 20 years. What has happened since then? Hunger has not been halved, it has increased. More than 1 billion people suffer from hunger every day. The opposite of what these organisations intended has occurred. There is a wide range of different causes for this. There are countries such as Zimbabwe where an incompetent government has transformed the bread basket of Africa into a famine region. A communist president has brought this rich country to a position where people are suffering from hunger and we say nothing. However, we share the responsibility for this. We spend weeks, if not years, talking about the climate in one hundred years’ time. The people who are suffering from hunger today and tomorrow are not interested in the climate in one hundred years. They want something to eat tomorrow, but we have no answers to their problems. Without wanting to neglect the issues of the future, it is a question of simple humanity to concern ourselves with people who are suffering from hunger today. Mr de Gucht, when we say that we intend to halve hunger by 2050, I find this almost insulting. As a world community, it must be possible for us to reduce the number of people who do not have enough to eat much more quickly. We can transport weapons to every corner of the world, but apparently we are not able to do this with food. This is a failure of the world community, which I would like to denounce. We must find other answers than the ones which we have come up with today. Albert Deß  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, I am grateful to Mrs Herranz García for bringing up this topic today in Parliament. This is a discussion which is fundamental to food policy. I am not interested in shaming Brazil or other countries. The basic question is this: Do we need these strict regulations for European agricultural production in the interests of consumer safety? If the answer is ‘yes’, then this means that consumer protection is regarded as a coherent whole. If the regulations are needed, then the same rules must apply to imports as to our own farmers. The Commission must not allow imports from countries which do not fulfil these requirements. Cattle farmers in Europe must not be punished because one cow in their herd has an ear tag missing, when imports are allowed from cattle herds which do not have a single ear tag. This is not acceptable. If traceability is so important for consumer protection, then it must also apply to imports. If we cannot ensure that this is the case, then it is unfair to our farmers to demand it of them. I have the impression that those people in the Commission who are responsible for imports are applying double standards. As already discussed, I am not interested in partitioning off Europe. I would like to see fair competition for our farmers in Europe so that we can continue to guarantee the food supply of half-a-billion people in future. I can assure you of one thing, Commissioner, and you can pass this on to your successor, Parliament will continue to touch on this sore point. We will not give up until equal competitive conditions have been established. We have good arguments that we can bring up repeatedly to ensure that food security is guaranteed in Europe in future. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the request to use the urgent procedure put forward by the Commission is certainly not perfect. I can partially agree with what the previous speaker said. However, to not allow this request to use the urgent procedure now would send completely the wrong signals to the dairy farmers, who are expecting at least initial responses. That is why I support this request to use the urgent procedure. In the course of this procedure, we will have the opportunity to improve the motion by means of amendments and, as Mr Häusling suggested, to cede powers. It is absolutely the case that there are possibilities to put a time limit on these powers so that we only give the Commission a power for two years before we then decide on the matter again. I would therefore ask for your support in order to put this request for use of the urgent procedure on the agenda. (Applause) Albert Deß,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome the fact that this request to use the urgent procedure was passed here in Parliament today by a large majority. In this way, we have sent a signal to our dairy farmers and have not shied away from the responsibility. In contrast to a minority of my fellow Members from other groups, we see, in this request to use the urgent procedure, an additional tool to get help to dairy farmers at a difficult time. It is certainly true that this request from the Commission did come very late in the day and that it is less than what is possible. That said, it is always better than doing nothing at all. The views within my own group about the proposed buy-back programme also diverge widely. The programme would have to be obligatory for it to have any impact at all. Yet I see no majority for that in this Parliament or in the Council. Furthermore, such a programme would not be acceptable to some of the Member States as it would be tantamount to a cutting back of the balancing out arrangement and also of the quotas. The indication that quotas are to be raised for priority groups is a decision that is already the law in force. The inclusion of milk and milk products in Article 186 for immediate measures in the event of market disturbances is to be welcomed. Nonetheless, I will be tabling an amendment to the effect that this measure should be restricted to two years. If it proves its worth, we will then agree to an extension. Finally, I would like to say thank you for the EUR 280 million. Commissioner, you have indeed largely accommodated Parliament. I know that you do not have any more money available to you. I ask that the – possibly amended – motion for a resolution be approved on Thursday. Albert Deß,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is, of course, extremely difficult to summarise this problem in two minutes, but I will try to do it in the style of bullet points. The dairy sector is in trouble. Many dairy farmers are seeing their very existence under threat. The main reason for this is a huge drop in milk product sales. The Commission really should have acted more swiftly in this regard. I would also have preferred to see stronger sales promotion measures instead of a greater amount of intervention, such as butter fat being used once again in the ice cream industry. Last year, when the price of butter reached more than EUR 4 for a short time, a large proportion of the ice cream industry stopped processing butter fat. I know the figures for Germany, which show that around 100 000 tonnes is no longer being processed by the food industry, which corresponds to a million tonnes of milk. We must try to stimulate sales once again, in order to clear these quantities from the market. I would like to thank the groups that have helped in drawing up our joint motion for a resolution. Unfortunately, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance did not participate in this discussion. Commissioner, as a short-term measure we are calling for an increase in the de minimis subsidies in an additional motion which is being tabled with 40 signatures, because this would be an opportunity to help the smaller dairy farmers in particular. It would also make sense to introduce an early retirement regulation. I know a lot of farmers who are 58 years old and who would like to stop working soon. An appropriate regulation would be needed for this. Commissioner, I would like to thank you sincerely for your work. I would ask you to put in place appropriate regulations to improve the situation of our dairy farmers. Perhaps you will still have the chance to remedy this situation in the near future.

 I abstained in today’s vote on the ACTA agreement, because I believe that we should wait for the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union on ACTA. The intention is for the Court to carry out a definitive examination of whether the agreement changes existing European law. I have read the agreement myself and I believe that this is not the case. In 2010, the EU seized 103 million products at its external borders that were most probably counterfeit products. For the first time the estimated value of the equivalent genuine products was also quoted, this being more than EUR 1 billion. In view of these incredible figures, I believe that we urgently need to work even more intensively to combat product piracy in order to safeguard the competitiveness of our European industry. A global agreement on the protection of intellectual property is therefore essential. Angelika Niebler,

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I assume that each of you here in plenary has a smartphone and that you use them all the time, wherever you are – whether you are out and about at home, in your own country, or in Europe, whether you are on holiday or on business. We here in Parliament are by no means exceptional; our citizens are also permanently mobile and on the move in Europe. Our young people, in particular, are constantly online nowadays. That is why I am particularly pleased that tomorrow, we will be able to adopt the Roaming III Regulation, as it is known, which will enter into force on 1 July 2012. In other words, just in time for the holiday season, we will be able to give our citizens the benefit of lower tariffs when they use smartphones in Europe. The future belongs to mobile devices. These days, everyone is mobile 24 hours a day. In recent years, there has been a huge increase in data transfer via smartphones in particular, and we will see further huge increases in the years ahead. In contrast, the costs of using a mobile phone abroad are still extremely high; indeed, they have hardly come down at all. That is unacceptable. The charges must reflect reality. We cannot allow people using smartphones at home or in another European country to be charged many times what they have to pay at home for making calls, sending or receiving texts or downloading data. I can tell you that I am with a German provider, and at the beginning of this week, my provider informed me that I will have to pay EUR 8.20 if I download one megabyte of data here in Brussels. That is a complete rip-off, and we cannot allow it to continue. What, then, will the new Roaming Regulation do? Its main aim is reduced charges for all our citizens. We hope to achieve this by creating greater competition in the roaming market in future. We are introducing maximum charges, and one particularly new element is a maximum retail charge for data transfer. The first maximum retail charge will take effect on 1 July 2012. In future, one megabyte will cost no more than EUR 0.70. The charges will be lowered further from 1 July 2013, when a maximum retail charge of EUR 0.45 per megabyte will come into force. The third price reduction will take effect on 1 July 2014, when the maximum charge will become EUR 0.20 per megabyte. We had to fight hard for these maximum retail charges in tough negotiations with the Council. I would like to extend my great thanks to my shadow rapporteurs and, in particular, to the rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, Robert Goebbels. Had we not fought so hard for better charges, then we would not be today where we hope to be after 1 July. The market will also be opened up to new providers without a network of their own, in what is known as an open access solution. Moreover, from 1 July 2014, consumers will be able to choose roaming services from providers other than their national provider. This proposed solution is known as unbundling and, in future, European customers will also be able to use local services when travelling abroad – known as local break-out – by being able to choose the best offer from the various local operators, as is already the case for WLan access. We have also introduced consumer protection rules. In future, these will apply not just within Europe, but also outside the European Union. The obligation to send a warning when users reach a certain tariff level, a certain level of charges, will also apply abroad. Other consumer protection rules have also been introduced in order to prevent involuntary roaming. All in all, I can say that today is a good day for our citizens of Europe. I am pleased that from 1 July, charges will be reasonable, even for roaming. (Applause) Angelika Niebler,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Ms Kroes, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank everyone very much for the many appreciative comments. I am very pleased, because I have never before received so much praise in Parliament. However, I would also like to express my gratitude and, most importantly, to return the thanks of all the Members of this Parliament who have given me such strong support during the debates. Of course, I would like to thank the Danish Presidency and the Commission once again for their excellent cooperation. It is true that we have a European internal market and a Single Euro Payments Area. I believe that our objective must be to establish a single European communication area, as many Members have already said in the course of this debate. Creating a roaming-free area in Europe must be our ultimate goal. I very much hope that we will be able to achieve this in the near future. I also hope, Ms Kroes, that we do not need a Roaming IV Regulation, as Mr Rübig has suggested. I hope, as a result of the structural measures and the competition which will now develop, that one provider will make a bold move and stop charging for roaming altogether. I hope that this will happen before the revision and before you submit a report here in 2016. I hope that the competitive market functions in such a way that the subject of roaming finally becomes a thing of the past. I would like to pass on my warm thanks. I am looking forward to the vote tomorrow and I hope that Parliament will give the report substantial support. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, who also so successfully put across Parliament’s position in the negotiations with the Council. ‘Spectrum Gunnar’, you have my thanks! More and more European citizens make use of mobile Internet services, and the trend is upwards. I have a couple more figures to highlight this. In 2010 alone, average monthly smartphone usage doubled to 79 MB from 35 MB the previous year. Similarly, in 2010 3 million new tablets – such as the iPad – were newly connected to the mobile network. In future, too, even greater data traffic is anticipated. Experts predict that mobile data traffic will increase by a factor of 26 between 2010 and 2015, and in 2015 some 788 million people will use the Internet exclusively from mobile devices. Against this backdrop, the first European radio spectrum policy programme, which we will be deciding on tomorrow, therefore has a particular role to play. Our goal is clear – more frequencies need to be made available for wireless broadband networks in future than has been the case so far. The flood of data was threatening to block up the transmission capacities that we have hitherto had available. More frequencies will mean that we can continue to use our mobile Internet services without interruption in future. If we adopt the radio spectrum policy programme tomorrow with a broad majority, we will have done something positive for our citizens in Europe. As you all know, I am currently also fighting on another front, as rapporteur for the new Roaming Regulation, to bring about better conditions for mobile Internet use. I believe that surfing the net when abroad must become much cheaper. Commissioner, you have already brought forward a bold proposal in this regard. We also aim to be somewhat bolder in Parliament, as we want to achieve something for our European consumers. If the Roaming Dossier – as is my hope – can be wrapped up in the first half of this year I would be very pleased if I earned the nickname ‘Roaming Angelika’. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure we all agree that our objective is an open, fair Internet. That has already been mentioned by many fellow Members. We need this not only for our citizens, for users of the network and for the economy – the Commission mentioned this – but we also need it for our policies and for democratisation processes. I need only remind you of the Arab Spring. We would not have been able to find out about many of the developments in the North African states and in the Middle East if it had not been for the Internet. How will we achieve this? I would like to refer to what Mr van Nistelrooij said. The Netherlands has gone ahead with a regulation on net neutrality. That is – please forgive me, Mr van Nistelrooij – the wrong approach to take. I think it is important for us to take a genuine European approach here, for us not to propose 27 separate regulations in this regard, but at least in Europe to seek to take a unified, harmonised approach to this issue. Therefore, I would, above all, ask the Commission, after careful analysis of the facts and with the involvement of BEREC and the national regulators, to present a proposal as quickly as possible. In one sub-area – roaming – we are currently having this debate. Structural changes are already underway in this area in connection with switching operators. I believe that this is the right course to take. Perhaps we do not need any horizontal regulation of net neutrality at all. Roaming provides a good example here. I would like to make one final point. As I see it, the most important thing for our citizens at home is that there should be no misleading advertising in respect of fast transmission rates. Many providers entice customers with offers that promise extremely fast data transmission speeds. However, these offers can only be exploited at three o’clock on the morning. At other times, the transmission rates do not reach anywhere near the speeds frequently promised in the advertisements. I would be grateful – to you, too, Ms Gaj – if you could check once again with BEREC and get back to us as to whether the subject of ‘no misleading advertising in respect of fast transmission rates’ is also being addressed.

 Firstly, I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, who has succeeded over months of tough negotiations in drafting a report on the subject of women and business leadership which, to a large extent, is very balanced and deserves our support. I would like to explain briefly why I voted against paragraph 1 and paragraph 16b. The figures on the proportion of women in management positions are shameful. Therefore, I am fully convinced that we finally need to take targeted measures to bring about a significant increase in this proportion. However, I feel that the calls made in paragraph 1 and paragraph 16b go too far. I do not believe that we should intervene in the operational management of businesses or set quotas even for the board of directors. Therefore, we should first of all call on companies to take voluntary measures. In particular, I think that 2012 is far too early for the introduction of legislative provisions and quotas. However, in order to send out a clear political signal that something needs to be done urgently and, at the same time, to support the efforts made by Mrs Kroes, I have voted in favour of the resolution as a whole. Angelika Niebler  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we definitely need more women in the top executive suites of companies throughout the European Union. You all know the statistics. Only one in ten board members in the European Union are women; 97% of board members are men. I think that we all agree that action is urgently needed. I should like to thank the Commissioner. Commissioner, it was you who took the bold step in March and called for action. You called on companies to take voluntary action. If they do not, you will table a legislative proposal, a legal basis, in March 2012. Thank you so much. The figures that we have seen in the meantime illustrate that something has already been done. If you had not been so bold, Mrs Reding, we would not have made these small steps. I should also like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, for her excellent draft. I agree with many of the statements in this draft. I shall support the draft, even though I take a different view of the quota as it now stands in the report. I take the view that, if self-regulation does nothing to help, a statutory quota is needed in order to put pressure on companies. However, I also take the view that we should start by introducing this quota for the supervisory structures of large companies, not for the operational side of businesses. I shall not therefore support the proposal in paragraph 16(b); however, I shall vote in favour of the report, because it says the right things. How women stand on the quota is a question of their own self-image. I would have no problem in using a quota to open the door. Whether or not I am good at my job is something that I still have to prove, regardless of how I get there. In that respect, a quota helps, but it is no substitute for performance. No woman has a problem with a door being held open. You have to walk through and prove yourself. Women in the European Union also need to be given an opportunity to walk through.

 Madam President, I would like to ask you, Mrs Harms, why you have not thanked Mr Oettinger. Why did you not say thank you? I think the accusations that you have made against him here are outrageous. Mr Oettinger was the only person who made the most of the opportunity to bring together everyone involved immediately after Fukushima and to insist that we carry out stress tests at a European level, regardless of the responsibilities. Now we have a result that goes far beyond the tests carried out over the last 15 or 20 years, with European involvement and with peer reviews by teams that have been put together at a European level. I believe it is unfair for you to continue following your own green policy without taking any responsibility. Angelika Niebler,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mrs Reding, ladies and gentlemen, let me perhaps introduce the topic with a few examples. Greece and other states are heavily in debt, although billions from the structural funds have been poured into these countries for many years. How can we improve the use of these resources and how can the utilisation of these resources be better controlled? My second example relates to Eurobonds. What effect do they have on the European budget? Thirdly, if we were to introduce a financial transaction tax in Europe, what would the consequences be? For all these questions, Parliament demands in its reports that a regulatory impact assessment be carried out. After all, we need facts in order to be able to take politically sound decisions. That is what my report on improving the guarantee of independent impact assessments is all about. This is not a new issue. It has occupied us, together with other issues concerning the improvement of legislation, for over ten years. However, despite all the efforts of the Commission to improve its impact assessment as well as those that we have made in this regard in the European Parliament, the quality of the impact assessment is still in need of improvement. My report puts forward proposals for how, with regard to the European Commission and the impact assessments that it carries out, as well as with regard to Parliament’s impact assessment studies, we can succeed in bringing about this improvement. In terms of its content, the report is divided into four sections. Firstly, there are general requirements for impact assessments at European level. The second section contains proposals directed at the European Commission and it lists potential areas where improvements can be made. In the third section, I discuss how we in the European Parliament can better optimise the regulatory impact assessment as an instrument. In the last section, I then propose that we in Parliament create an autonomous impact assessment structure. With regard to the general requirements for impact assessments at European level, it is important to note that we need to move away from pure cost analysis towards an examination of the economic, social and health-related impact of legislation at European level. Secondly, I think it is important that we carry out an SME test in connection with all regulatory impact assessments and also examine the effect on industrial competitiveness in Europe. Thirdly, in this report, we propose the early publication by the Commission of road maps of proposed legislation in order to give Parliament and the stakeholders the opportunity to express their opinions during the consultation period. With regard to the European Commission, we call, in particular, for the members of the Impact Assessment Board that was set up a while ago in the Commission to be independent and for the parliamentary committees to be involved in the work at an early stage. With regard to Parliament, we believe it is important for us actually to utilise the regulatory impact assessment as an instrument. Up to now, a few committees have been using it, but I think we need to make much more extensive use of this instrument in our discussions in Parliament. If we succeed in developing Parliament’s own resources and establishing an autonomous structure under the leadership of Members of this House in order to develop a method that allows us to carry out professional regulatory impact assessments within the European Parliament, then I believe we will have achieved a great deal with this report. I hope it will receive your support tomorrow in the vote. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Mr President, I apologise for taking the floor once again, but I believe that some confusion has arisen, because my fellow Members are not currently discussing my report, but the report on social responsibility, which will be debated later. Perhaps we could first finish the debate on the subject of the impact assessment – I believe Mr Baldassarre had asked to speak on the subject of my report – and then we can move on to the next report.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe 2020 strategy – to be honest, I do not feel like discussing the Europe 2020 strategy at all. Ten years ago, we adopted a strategy, the Lisbon Strategy. When you now look back at this past decade, the results are limited, if I may put it in those modest terms. I think that we should currently be focusing on what really matters to people at home in our Member States, rather than making the same mistake again. They are wondering whether we will be able to ensure the stability of our currency. Will there be inflation? What lessons do we need to learn from the developments over the last two years, from the financial and economic crisis, and now from the currency crisis? Are we really taking to task the players in the financial markets who have contributed to the crisis? I would emphatically call on the Commission, first and foremost, to take steps to ensure rapid financial market regulation and progress in Europe in order to prevent, as has been the case in recent years, money being sent around the globe five times in the same day and many people making a profit on this while losses are being nationalised. I would ask the Commission to demand that Member States exercise strict budgetary discipline and implement appropriate rules. I would also ask for the earliest possible tightening of the Stability and Growth Pact. This is where we should be focusing our efforts. I urge the Commission to take requisite measures, but not as before, off its own bat or by discussing them thoroughly with Member States. Instead, it should finally take Parliament seriously as an equal legislator alongside the 27 Members States. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, over recent months, the conditions for the people, as well as the overall political and economic situation, have dramatically deteriorated in Yemen. We Europeans must therefore do everything we can to finally stabilise the country. High Representative, might I ask you to please prevent Yemen from becoming a second Afghanistan. We must do everything in our power to fight international terrorism. We will only be able to achieve that, however, if we also support a peace process in Yemen. We need to achieve peace in the region and we need to support the peace efforts of the government there. The Yemeni Government could also be reminded, once again, that it needs to ensure that there is no discrimination in Yemen – only then can there be peace. Peace requires democratic structures that uphold the rights of minorities. That is our European path, and it may differ from other paths. I ask you, in your new role, to spare no efforts to walk this European path with us. Without political stability, Yemen has no chance. With political stability, the local economy can recover, then an economy can be built up and people can be given future prospects. I ask you to work hard for this. I also ask you to make your influence count to ensure that the auxiliary troops there can provide humanitarian assistance. There are over 130 000 refugees from Somalia in Yemen. The situation on the ground is dreadful. I put all my hopes on you, Baroness Ashton, in the expectation that you will use your influence here. Please also stand up for the six hostages, for the European citizens – one Briton and five Germans – who are being held as hostages in Yemen. Maybe you can also help to get them freed. Many thanks.

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you will all be familiar with Google, the internet search engine. You will probably also know about the new Google Books Project, which everyone has been discussing over the last few months. The aim of the project is to scan in books from libraries and make them available over the internet, so that readers have quick and easy access to a large number of works on the web. From the perspective of readers and internet users, this is a wonderful idea. However, what does it mean for authors, creative people, artists and publishers? What part will they play in the publication of their work on the web? We must look closely at these questions over the next few months. You may already be aware that publishers and authors in the US have initiated legal proceedings against Google with regard to the scanning and publication of works on the web. As far as I know, the legal dispute has been resolved and the parties have settled out of court. However, the questions remain unanswered and they relate not only to the situation with Google, because there are certain to be similar cases in future. We must deal with these questions as quickly as possible. Does copyright need to be adapted in the digital age? Do we need to change existing structures? In this respect, I am thinking particularly of the role of the collecting societies, which we have often discussed in Parliament. Are new monopolies being created on the web? How should we react to this? How will this change the structures in our countries, for example, with regard to the bookshops in the regions? What are the opposing interests in this case and how can we find a suitable balance between them? Authors and publishers want to receive a financial reward for their work. This also applies, of course, when their works are made available on the internet. Libraries want to put their archives on the web without having to sign a licence agreement with every copyright holder first. The interests of consumers are clear. They would very much like to have quick and easy access to the content on the web. We have not yet reached the point of being able to discuss possible solutions, but we need to ask ourselves a lot of questions and that is the purpose of the written question submitted to the Commission by the Committee on Legal Affairs. Do we need to make distinctions in order to resolve the copyright issues, for example, with regard to content? If so, what distinctions should be made? The Commission seems to be moving in this direction, as it is first of all focusing on the situation of the library stocks. Should there be a process of mass digitisation in future, or is our existing licensing system sufficient to resolve the problem? How can copyright clearance be simplified in the internet age? As you know, copyright is primarily a national right and in this respect, we must once again ask ourselves: is this still an up-to-date approach? How should we deal with orphan works in future, in other words, books whose copyright holder cannot be identified or located? Should we perhaps distinguish between literary works and scientific or academic works? For example, the authors of novels earn their living from the publication of their books, but when scientists make their papers available on the web, they are primarily interested in making a name for themselves in their field of research and are less reliant on the money that their work earns. There are numerous questions that we need to ask ourselves and I am pleased to be able to discuss them with you. I would like to consider one last important point and that is once again the subject of collecting societies. Look at how easy it is nowadays to download music from the internet. You simply go to iTunes and buy songs for 20, 30, 40 or 50 cents. What are the implications for the collecting societies? Do we still need them? I would be pleased if the Commission could once again give us an idea of what the current situation is. In Parliament, we have been asking the Commission for years to take a look at the collecting societies. To put it rather imprecisely, these are also monopolistic bodies, which have been established over a period of decades. I am interested to know what the Commission is planning. My final point is that if you take a platform like Google, which makes everything freely available, this will result in a monopoly being created on the web. We need to consider how the situation should be handled in order to ensure that we do not end up with just one supplier, who then decides on the conditions for access to content on the web. I am looking forward to a debate with you over the next few weeks and months and I will be interested to hear the Commission’s response to the first question from the Committee on Legal Affairs. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I have three points to make. The first is that the car industry is a key industry for Europe and – this has already been said – when you include all the upstream and downstream businesses and the whole supply industry, 12 million jobs depend on it. I just want to emphasise this one more time as Mr Chatzimarkakis is sitting there in front of me, having just said that the German Government’s efforts were electioneering bluster. I can only refute this definitively. It is a mocking affront to the workers employed in this sector across numerous European countries who have to fear for their jobs day in and day out. Secondly, rescuing Opel is in the common interests of Europe as a whole. I think it is particularly important to stress this, irrespective of the debate today. There are sites in the UK, Belgium, Poland, Spain, Germany and other European countries. If Opel is rescued by the fact that there is an investor, namely Magna, that there are bridging loans, for which the German Government fought, it is not only in Germany’s interests but those of Europe as a whole. We must all take steps to retain jobs in our home countries. I am pleased. Where would we be today if we had not taken steps to bring about the trusteeship solution? There would not be any need for further debate today in that case, as the debate would have been done and dusted in any case when General Motors drew GM Europe along with it into the mess surrounding its insolvency. My third point is that there are strict rules for State aid. I am confident that the Commission will examine this matter in a proper manner doing justice to the interests involved. The crucial question will be whether Opel Europe can be profitable again in the medium term. I am confident that the solution that has now been produced and on which Magna, too, is working, and which involves many other European States, can be implemented. I ask the Commission to also provide the relevant authorisation and I would like to conclude by re-stating that, in this case, we have achieved something positive for the car industry in Europe as a whole! Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Ms McAvan, warmly for her excellent work once again. Good pharmacovigilance protects the citizens of Europe. At the same time, we are also bolstering informed patients. It was therefore very important to close the safety loopholes exposed and actually opened up by the Mediator case as soon as possible. From now on, a company that removes a medicinal product from the market must state the reasons why it is doing so. The other Member States will also be informed via the European Medicines Agency – something that is irremissible for the protection of patients in Europe’s internal market, too. There is one point that is particularly close to my heart, which is the better readability of package inserts. Many patients really do complain about the complexity of package inserts. They say they are too difficult, too hard to understand, too unreadable, too confusing. This is a subject that the older elements of the population in particular bring up, although it is not only them. Some patients are even so scared by the side effects when trying to find important information that, in the end, they do not even take the medicine. Together with Mr Liese, I therefore advocated the idea that the package insert should be made more readable for patients and that a drug facts box containing the most important information, including the side effects, should be included on the package insert, written in plain language and given graphic emphasis. I am very pleased about the result obtained from the negotiations, and about the fact that the Commission, Commissioner Dalli, has also promised to produce a report on better readability. I hope that the Commission will keep its promise and also that it does so as soon as possible. I would be interested to hear – and I am happy to take the opportunity presented by the presence of Commissioner Dalli with us here today – whether there are already specific ideas in this regard at this point. I would be really interested to hear the answer to that question. I would like to offer my thanks to the Commission for having tackled this issue, as it really does represent a major step towards patient friendliness if we can improve the package insert and make it more readable.

Blue-card question.

 I have a question for Ms Girling. She has just stated that the rules for gluten intolerance will not be of any further help. I believe that it is very important to protect these people because intolerance sufferers require this strict diet. If we fail to include them in the high protection standards of this regulation, instead depending solely on food labelling, then the necessary level of protection is not assured. It is for this reason that I strongly support this resolution and would like to ask Ms Girling why she believes this is not the case. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
).  
– (DE) 
Mr President, the average consumer has complete freedom to choose products in the supermarket and to consume them afterwards. The provisions of the Food Labelling Regulation are sufficient for this. Certain groups, such as infants and small children, require particular protection when it comes to composition and labelling, however. As a mother of a one-year-old daughter who breast-fed her child for seven months, I am very pleased that milk replacement products can no longer be advertised with euphemistic images suggesting that these products might even be better than breast milk. I also welcome the fact that follow-on milk is once again to be examined, as I also decided against using this milk. It tastes sweet and actually encourages the child to prefer such products, so that in the future it will not drink conventional milk. People who suffer from gluten intolerance need special foods if they are to avoid serious complications, such as bowel cancer. It is for this reason that I also believe it important to maintain a high standard of protection here. This is only possible by incorporating gluten intolerance in the regulation. This includes, for example, provisions requiring that the foods for these patients should provide the same amount of vitamins and minerals as the foods they replace. It is vital that this protection standard is maintained. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
),

 I can only agree that we should put an end to the wastage of food. The figures are alarming: 60% of food waste in European households could be avoided. The Commission has come to the conclusion that a fifth of the food is thrown away because ‘best before’ dates are not used correctly. I can therefore only support the call for 2013 to be declared the European Year against Food Waste, with information and educational initiatives. We need citizens to be more aware, right from childhood onwards. We need to explain to our citizens what the ‘best before’ date means. The ‘best before’ date is not an expiry date. Consumers should use it only as a guide. The ‘use by’ date for perishable goods is different. These products should not be consumed after such a date. We all have a responsibility to prevent food waste across Europe and to create greater understanding. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
),

 In the European Parliament, we have been fighting for safe, high-quality foodstuffs for many years. The text that we have voted on today provides anything but this, as it waters down the current standards for the quality of fruit juices in Europe. Therefore, I was unable to vote in favour of the compromise package today. However, I would also like to express my criticism of the negotiation process. It is unacceptable for the opinion of the lead committee to be disregarded to a large extent in the compromise package. The European Parliament fought long and hard to be given equal legislative powers. We must also exercise this responsibility in the negotiations for the good of the citizens of Europe. In the interests of these citizens, I would have liked the result of the vote to have been different today. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, today’s vote in the European Parliament aimed at combating Internet pornography is pioneering the protection of our children. We will have more protection for the victims and better prevention. The measures adopted will enable better prevention of all abuse of children, in particular the growing phenomenon of child pornography on the Internet. National laws are not enough to combat child Internet pornography. Here the European Union offers us an opportunity to stamp out these grievous activities on a Europe-wide basis. As a young mother, it is a particular concern and very important for me that pornographic material involving children should be taken down off the Internet immediately. I therefore welcome the decision to prescribe the deletion of such material as the ideal solution. The new regulations also provide a greater level of protection for the victims throughout Europe through higher, more stringent penalties for the perpetrators. I fully support the comprehensive approach taken by the directive. The legal framework is every bit as important as information and prevention measures. This law puts us on the right path for protecting the youngest members of our society. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
),

 I would like to thank Mrs Sommer, the rapporteur, for her excellent work over the last four years. Today’s vote in the European Parliament is groundbreaking. It brings more clarity and openness for consumers. The model I have in mind is that of responsible consumers who are aware of what they are buying. However, that will only be the case when they also know what a product contains. Today’s decision will introduce standardised, mandatory nutrition labelling relating to per 100 g/100 ml amounts, thereby allowing consumers to compare products on the supermarket shelves. All the existing food labelling is voluntary, sometimes confusing and difficult to compare. Mandatory labelling which shows the nutritional value of foods will give consumers the information they need to make informed purchasing decisions. Consumers are increasingly being misled or deceived about food. We only need to think of imitation cheese on pizza, reconstituted ham, ice cream that contains no milk and chocolate biscuits without chocolate. Often, cheap substitutes or aromas are used. All these imitation products must, in future, be labelled as such. The food labelling regulation is a major success on behalf of European consumers, which is why I have supported it. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, I am not convinced with regard to all of the points of the compromise, but I know that the new regulation represents a definite improvement on the current legal situation. First of all, we will get a standardised European technical language for the performance of construction products and streamlined and simplified procedures. We have made progress with the European internal market and, in so doing, we have benefited the companies and also, through standardised safety requirements, the consumers, too. In principle, I regard relief from bureaucratic regulations for micro-enterprises to be important and sensible. However, we also need to take account of the fact that micro-enterprises that process construction products are also users and must also be protected. I am therefore pleased that my proposal was included in the compromise. This provides for simplified procedures for micro-enterprises in connection with the evaluation of the performance characteristics of construction products. However, if they apply such a procedure, they must prove the equivalence of the procedure used with the procedure that is actually provided for throughout Europe. This is the only way to ensure that the details of the performance characteristics are also accurate and reliable and that the safety of buildings is also ensured throughout Europe. Anja Weisgerber,

 Mr President, Commissioner Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, those who helped produce this report and everyone who contributed to this splendid result. Without the constructive and very open collaboration with both the Commission and with the Belgian Presidency of the Council, it would not be possible to conclude this package tomorrow. As I am sure you can imagine, I am very satisfied with this result. The repeal of a total of eight outdated and obsolete directives will enable us to take another step in the direction of less bureaucracy in Europe. What is interesting in said directives is that they largely became obsolete because they have already been replaced by international standards that represent the latest state of the art. Member State rules and regulations are often rendered obsolete by harmonised European rules and regulations, after all. In this case, European rules and regulations have become superfluous thanks to international stipulations. If we want to make progress towards our target of having 25% less bureaucracy in Europe by 2012, we need to nail our colours to the mast now. To put it in the words of the Chair of the High Level Group of Independent Stakeholders on Administrative Burdens, Edmund Stoiber, we in Europe must not only purse our lips, we need to whistle loudly. In other words, our words must be followed up by tangible action. When it comes to that action, the devil is often in the detail, however. This directive repealing eight directives relating to metrology has shown this clearly once again. Measuring instruments for cold water meters for non-clean water, alcohol meters, certain weights, tyre pressure gauges and equipment to measure the standard mass of grain or the size of ship tanks have been replaced, in practice, by more modern digital equipment. The outdated equipment is used increasingly rarely and the rules governing such equipment can thus be abolished. There are also no consequences for the functioning of the internal market or for the high standard of consumer protection, which remains of great importance to us. Yet the Council has been blocking this package for some time. We have managed, however, to reach a reasonable compromise between the Council and Parliament in the informal trialogue, and even to do so at first reading – which is always the exception rather than the rule for us. The substance of that agreement is as follows: one directive – namely that concerning the calibration of ship tanks – is to be repealed immediately, which is to say, with effect from 1 July 2011, while the remaining seven directives will be repealed once the recast version of the Framework Measuring Instruments Directive (MID), which the Commission is currently working on, has been adopted. The Commission will produce a new proposal for the MID by the end of April 2011. The idea is that the Commission, when reviewing the MID, will also examine whether and, if so, what elements from the old directives should be retained and should therefore be incorporated into the MID to that end. If the Member States provide evidence that certain elements within the seven directives are still necessary, for example, on consumer protection grounds, such as provisions from the directive relating to tyre pressure gauges for motor vehicles, these sections will be incorporated into the Framework Measuring Instruments Directive. Once the recast version of the MID has been adopted, the remaining directives will be repealed. This is a signal that Europe is serious about cutting red tape and that we are eager to create the conditions for sustainable economic growth. I am proud of the fact that the European Parliament is doing its bit, in this way, to help cut red tape and to produce better, more streamlined and simpler lawmaking. Allow me just to conclude with a brief word about the correlation tables. These are the tables that the Member States are supposed to draw up in order to document how they have implemented the directive. In the end, we agreed on a less strict wording in this regard. We fought for stricter wordings in future, however, and we achieved our goal in this regard. The Conference of Presidents will champion this cause accordingly to the Council and the Commission. This represents a success that we have the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs to thank for. Anja Weisgerber,

 Mr President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow Members, including my appreciation of their valuable contributions to the debate tonight. After the vote in the morning, we need to shift our focus to the future. Naturally, we are looking forward to seeing how the individual rules and regulations turn out – the Commission has now announced that it will table its proposal for the Measuring Instruments Directive (MID) by the end of April. It will then also be possible to check whether any of the individual legislative regimes that we are removing from circulation are to be incorporated. It is important, as Mrs Comi also said, that no legal vacuum arises. Mrs Gebhardt, I can tell you that that was also a very important concern for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and it was one that we were able to follow up on. For me, however, it is also important to mention that the Member States are required to document even more strictly why certain aspects or elements should be retained, as it is only in those circumstances that we really need European regulations; they are not an end in themselves. I am also looking forward to the Internet consultation that the Commission has announced and which will take place between 6 September and 1 November 2011. The consultation will also involve the companies affected, the authorities and so forth. Once again, I will be listening closely to businesses. When it comes to the existing directive, too, I checked whether these measuring instruments were still in use and, as it happened, the response every single time – for example, from my wine growing association, which I asked about alcohol meters – was that such items of equipment certainly are not used any longer. We therefore need to look very closely into this. If we really do want to make progress towards this target of cutting red tape in Europe by 25% by 2012 – and that, of course, is no longer very far away – we need to make major progress in this area. We, as Parliament, are ready to play a part. Finally, I just have one more thing to say about the correlation tables. I want to state, at this point, that, once again, what we have here is a compromise, but, with regard to the future, I would like to call on the Member States to commit to actually drawing up these tables because this really is about a uniform implementation of the rules and regulations throughout Europe.

 Mr President, in relation to the adoption of the Toys Directive, I would like to point out that, when we adopted the directive, we had an objective in mind, namely, making children’s toys safer, as children, in particular, still growing and developing as they are, have a particularly sensitive reaction to hazardous substances and chemicals. Considering the most up-to-date scientific knowledge at that point, we laid down the strictest requirements anywhere in the world for toys through European legislation. As every year, this issue comes to the fore in the run-up to Christmas, and for me personally, too, as a mother-to-be, this issue is one that is close to my heart, and I think it is very important that we have the strictest standards. That is why I helped initiate this debate. I did so in the light of new expert opinions that have concluded that the strictest limit values for heavy metals are not strict enough, given the latest scientific knowledge. We included a clause in the directive specifically for cases like this, which makes it possible to modify and tighten up the limit values at a later date, and we now need to make use of that clause. Commissioner Tajani, that was something that we also called on your predecessor to do a year ago. I am pleased that, as I understand it, the Commission is to announce today, at least, that the limit values for certain heavy metals are to be tightened up, albeit with a delay from when we called on it to do so and certainly encouraged by the debate today. In general, however, we need to review all hazardous substances, and we should not, therefore, restrict ourselves to the heavy metals. Instead, we need to look into the latest information on the hazardous substances known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Should it also turn out that it is necessary to amend the limit values in order to protect our children, I call for a rectification of the legislation in this regard, too. At the end of the day, this is about the safety of our children. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Christofer Fjellner, and his shadow rapporteurs. Under difficult conditions, and despite battling against a severe headwind, a very good result has genuinely been achieved with this report. The Commission proposal has been improved considerably. A strict ban on advertising remains: there will be no information on the radio, television or in magazines; instead, patients must actively seek out the information. I base my position on the idea that patients are responsible people. They want to be informed, and I would very much like to help them achieve that. I therefore also want the patient to be at the centre of the information. I would like to focus on two key points. I myself have said in no uncertain terms – including in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – that I would like to see health portals on the Internet and similar information in printed media. Our citizens often look things up on the Internet, where they often come across poor and uncontrolled information. We must therefore counter this with an alternative: controlled information. Pharmacovigilance was a first success, with the adoption of drug safety portals that included the package leaflets and information on the medicines. However, I would like to go beyond this, Commissioner, and would have liked to have seen comprehensive Internet portals that also provide information on illnesses and prevention. If I have understood you correctly, you support this in principle, but perhaps have not said so in this dossier. I would like the Commissioner to make a clear statement as to whether he also supports this. I consider this to be a very, very important matter. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, our heartfelt thanks go to the rapporteur. The directive on electrical and electronic equipment is highly controversial. There were great differences of opinion regarding various aspects. I am therefore pleased that agreement has been reached and at what I regard as the good result of the trialogue negotiations. I would specifically like to reiterate two points. One is the question of the scope. What equipment should the directive actually cover? There is one thing that we must not forget: originally, it was meant to cover domestic appliances – in other words, white goods. The open scope now includes many new product groups, which would also have encompassed technologies for renewable energy. I must point out that this directive actually had a quite different objective. Naturally, much stricter and higher standards of protection need to be applied in the case of domestic appliances than in the case of technologies such as those that are uninstalled, recycled, etc. by specialist personnel. That is why I, in turn, advocated the exemption of renewable energies. I was not in favour of expanding the scope, but then I saw that a majority was moving in that direction. I think it would have been counterproductive to include renewable energy in this directive. It would have resulted in a competitive disadvantage and therefore I think it is the right decision. Then I would like to say something about Annex III: I would have had concerns about including a further 37 substances as priority substances when there is no real justification on health grounds for a future ban on these. I think that would be a panic measure, and that is why I think the decision made is the right one and am pleased about this aspect of the result too. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs very much for their excellent work. Effective supervision of medical products provides protection for the citizens of Europe and, at the same time, gives more power to responsible patients. Two points in particular are very important to me: the safety web portal for medicines and the patient information leaflet (PIL). The positive news is that tomorrow’s resolution will introduce safety web portals for medicines into all the Member States, where the approved patient information leaflet and other information must be published. This will put an end to an untenable situation. In many Member States, it is not possible to publish the PIL on the web. However, this is not in line with the real lives of many citizens who make use of the right of free movement within the European Union. Now they will be able to download PILs from the web in their own language anywhere in Europe. This will also be useful for patients who have lost their PIL. At the same time, I want the PIL to be improved and I am very pleased about the resolution calling on the Commission to submit draft legislation on this subject. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, today’s good news is that the new legislation will provide uniform, mandatory nutritional labelling that relates to 100 grams, thereby providing greater comparability. Statements of nutritional value provide consumers with information that allows them to make an informed purchasing decision. The model I have in my mind is that of the responsible consumer who knows what he is buying. Imitation products that are not clearly marked as such deliberately mislead consumers. Imitation cheese, pressed ham products, vanilla yoghurt that contains no vanilla whatsoever – these are just a few examples. All these imitation products must be labelled as such. I am pleased that we will send a clear signal to the Council tomorrow and that all of us here are agreed that we need better labelling. As far as I am concerned, the task is to provide information; we should leave consumers to make up their own minds, however. That is why I am against traffic light labelling. There are no unhealthy foods – only unhealthy, unbalanced diets. The traffic lights are misleading. I am in favour of food labelling according to the GDA model and am pleased that we are likely to vote to move towards this tomorrow. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

 Mr President, I just wanted to say that my voting machine has stopped working. I have not been able to take part in the last three votes. I would be grateful if you could send a technician. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

 Mr President, consumer protection is a very, very important matter for me and therefore I am against consumers being misled or deceived in any way. This is why I am fighting for better labelling of food imitations in the Regulation on the labelling of foodstuffs, for example. I am calling on the Council to follow this approach, which is also supported by the Commission. Today, we had to vote on glued meat. Glued meat is meat which is glued together and sold as a high-quality product. In my opinion, this should not be happening, in particular, when consumers are not aware of what is going on. The decision today was not an easy one for me. The Commission has proposed comprehensive labelling rules, but consumers may still be misled, because it is difficult to prove that a product contains thrombin. This means that it may be used but not indicated on the label. Therefore, I think a labelling requirement is not sufficient in this case. I have now voted in favour of the resolution and of a ban on thrombin. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, the climate negotiations in Copenhagen were disappointing for the European Union, as has already been mentioned. The result was a long way from the EU position and from the position that we need to be in to protect the climate. The only positive aspect is the recognition of the two-degree goal, as this could lead to the necessary reduction commitments. We must now ask ourselves what we can learn from the failure of the negotiations and what we should do next. It is important to have a period of reflection and to take a critical look at different points on the route that we have been following. We have to ask ourselves how we can make progress jointly with other states. How can we ensure that the EU is also present at the table when the US, China and India meet to negotiate a compromise? How can we negotiate more effectively with the developing countries and emerging economies? Is it essential that these negotiations take place under the aegis of the UN? Finally, I would like to say how pleased I am that I was able to vote for the resolution, because in my opinion, it continues to emphasise the pioneering role played by the European Union. We must now answer these questions and continue on our current path, both from a domestic and an international perspective. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank you most sincerely for the clarity of your words. Essentially, it should be said that, overall, the Toys Directive has brought a considerable improvement in the protection of our children. We all approached it with the intention of producing the most stringent legislation anywhere in the world. However, many parents and grandparents are now concerned – as you said – because of the studies by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. We now need to ask ourselves whether or not the Institute’s statements and opinion are right. In any case, we need to examine the facts of the matter very closely. It is a question of the protection of our children. At this point, I would like to thank you most sincerely for having stated that you are willing to do that. However, I think that things need to move more quickly. Not until next year, you say, during the first half of the year, will the findings of the scientific committee be available. It must be done quicker than that. It is a question of the protection of our children. I really cannot understand why the Federal Institute left it so long to come out with these statements. I want to make that point here, too. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the German conservative group (CSU) would like to see clear and practical rules for the protection of non-smokers being introduced throughout Europe. However, in my opinion, ‘throughout Europe’ does not necessarily mean ‘from within Europe’. Many Member States already have in place regulations for protecting non-smokers and others are in the process of introducing regulations of this kind. I do not believe – in common with the majority of my fellow Members in the European Parliament, which is very pleasing – that we in Brussels must impose regulations for the protection of non-smokers or that we are able to do this more effectively. The European Union has no authority in this area. We are only responsible for health and safety at work. This is where the problem lies, because for me the most important issue is protecting children and young people and this group, which specifically needs protection, would not be covered by regulations that refer only to health and safety at work. Therefore, the Member States must take action in this area. I have voted in favour and I am pleased that this amendment was accepted. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
).

Madam President, we need clear and practical rules for the protection of non-smokers to be introduced throughout Europe. However, in my opinion ‘throughout Europe’ does not necessarily mean ‘from Europe’. Many Member States already have in place legislation to protect non-smokers and others are in the process of introducing laws of this kind. Why are some of my fellow Members now saying that we in Brussels can do this much better than the Member States, regardless of the fact that the European Union has no authority on health policy and that we have to implement this via the circuitous route of health and safety at work? In my opinion, the Member States should decide which regulations to put in place to protect non-smokers. This makes sense, because they are closer to the local problems and issues. I do not understand why Brussels should impose protection for non-smokers in Lapland and in Andalusia which is identical in every detail. What has happened to the cross-border implications? We in Brussels have come up against our limits in this respect. For me, protecting children and young people is particularly important. We need comprehensive protection in this area. If we introduce protection for non-smokers on a European level via health and safety at work, we are not protecting children and young people, because they are not employees. Therefore, I would ask you to support Amendments 2 and 13 put forward by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Manfred Weber,

Mr President, Vice-President Reding, Mr Mavroyiannis, ladies and gentlemen, in July, contrary to existing laws, an impartial Ombudsman who has long campaigned against corruption was replaced by a government with someone who is willing to tow the party line. Two pieces of emergency legislation were passed that drastically reduce the powers of the constitutional court and change the legal position for a referendum to suspend the president from office while the case is in progress. An extremely dubious suspension procedure was pursued against the state president that was no longer under the supervision of the constitutional court as a result of the emergency legislation. The quorum requirements of the constitutional court were ignored. Finally, there are reports of irregularities in the electoral lists for the referendum on the suspension of the office of president, indicating that the electoral lists were even changed after the ballot was complete. To cap it all: constitutional lawyers and advocates have received personal threats during the process. As I read this list, you might think I am talking about a banana republic in some obscure part of the world. However, I am, in fact, talking about reports that we received during the summer from Romania, a Member State of the European Union. These reports and the discussions we have had to hold about them are disappointing and quite simply unacceptable. I am therefore pleased and grateful that the President of the Commission and, above all, our Vice-President, Ms Reding, have responded in a committed and decisive manner, demanding an explanation from Romania. It is unacceptable, however, for Prime Minister Ponta to promise the President of the Commission that the illegal and highly undemocratic emergency legislation will be repealed, while doing nothing at home in Romania. On the contrary, Mr Ponta has exploited the opportunity to bad-mouth the European Union. This is unworthy of a democratically elected prime minister and shows a profoundly undemocratic attitude of mind. Thanks again to the Commission for its decisive stance. The citizens of Romania and of Europe as a whole appreciate this. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Manfred Weber  (PPE

 I am happy to answer this question because Mr Paşcu is surely aware that neither he, nor I, nor Prime Minister Ponta is entitled to assess whether or not a court is biased in its decisions. A constitutional court is independent and, as such, is required to reach independent decisions, which both of us need to accept. You come from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. Your party has now decided not to hold your party congress in Bucharest because all party leaders in Europe say: I refuse to be photographed with Ponta. This is the reality and this is why I would ask the social democrats to go to Bucharest and say: see to it that the rule of law is implemented. Manfred Weber,

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the discussion of Schengen has generated a lot of headlines in Europe in recent weeks. For that reason, it is good that we are discussing this matter in Parliament today. I would like to start by indicating the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for the Commissioner in respect of the examination of the very specific detailed accusations in the European Union, and if it is found that offences have been committed at European internal borders, they should be properly investigated by the Commission, because the PPE Group wants a strong European authority that will monitor Schengen status in future. That brings us to the real debate, which is one that, ultimately, concerns us all. With its decision on the Schengen rules, the Council was itself probably not altogether clear on what it was hoping to achieve, because it has not only set out on a path that we consider to be dubious in terms of content, it has also, by choosing a new legal basis, departed from the path of cooperation with Members of this House. The Council has also interfered in one of Europe’s most important achievements, namely the open borders. For us, Schengen means freedom in place of borders, cooperation in place of egoism and working together instead of working against one another. The freedom to travel in Europe is the PPE Group’s top priority. The people, the economy and indeed the whole of Europe will benefit from this. We do not want the open borders, which are a visible feature of European cooperation, to be disproportionately restricted, particularly at a time when more European spirit is needed. As the PPE Group, we want the Member States to stop doing secret deals with each other on how essential rights of their citizens are to be dealt with. This method has failed; we must focus on the Community method. The PPE Group wants the decision making to come out of the diplomatic backrooms and the decisions on these new legal bases to be made by the elected bodies in which citizens are represented. The PPE Group will fight to retain these rights in Europe. As far as the content is concerned, we do not see any insurmountable obstacles. The question is whether we will actually find a way forward in this process together. I have to say, Mr Mavroyiannis, that this is not the way for family members to treat each other. It destroys the spirit of European cooperation. We therefore ask the Council to return to the path of cooperation, and – as you said yourself today – more intensive contact is not enough for the European Parliament. We are legislators and we are involved in the decision, and for that reason I would ask you to withdraw your decision on the legal basis and involve Parliament as an equal legislator. Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we want to use the time tomorrow to discuss the current political situation in Romania, for three essential reasons. Firstly, we have all read in the newspapers that the matter at issue is a dispute about whether the Prime Minister is responsible for his doctoral thesis. His doctoral thesis is not our affair, however. Our subject instead is what is being done to the ethics commission in Romania responsible for resolving such incidents, which is a source of indignation for us – how people are being appointed ex post facto
, how the ethics commission is being padded out, in order to possibly reach different results, and also how these results are being published in the official gazette, amended between Parliament and the government, in order to be able to react as quickly as possible and to be able to water down disagreeable judgments. The second thing that bothers us is the issue of what happened to the public television service in Romania. The legal basis for public service television in Romania states that the parliamentary groups are to be represented proportionately in the monitoring committees, while the people who have now been appointed all belong to the government’s political group, which is thus a violation of the law. The third request that we have, the third consideration that bothers us, is probably the most weighty, the most difficult, which is Romania’s representation at the European Council at the end of the week. I say this as there has been a dispute between the President and the Prime Minister as to who will represent Romania at the summit. This question was put to the Romanian constitutional court, which unambiguously decided that the President is responsible for representing the country abroad. The Prime Minister, meanwhile, has rejected this decision by the constitutional court and mobilised his parliamentary group to fight back. All of these are points where we ask the question of whether a prime minister is in a position to adhere to the democratic ground rules, the ground rules according to the constitution, or whether he wants to lead his country into a constitutional crisis. (Heckling)
 We therefore ask to debate this. Those Members who were heckling should bear in mind that we, as Parliament, need to take a critical view of developments – seriously, Mr Swoboda – and not view them through our party political spectacles. We should at least have the opportunity to discuss this – no more and no less! Anyone with nothing to hide need not be afraid of a debate. Manfred Weber,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would urge that we vote now. We have had two months to discuss this subject in depth. There has been a lot of discussion between the groups. Then, in the last few days, pressure from the genetic engineering lobby was also added to the mix, and this has now caused confusion once again. We are of the opinion that we have discussed all there is to discuss and that a decision can now be taken. There are two arguments: our citizens are expecting signals from us with regard to how we are going to deal with biopatents, and the European Patent Office is also expecting clear signals from Parliament on how the current law is to be implemented. That is why we should decide today. Manfred Weber  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Bødskov, we should admit to each other that we are all struggling to uphold data protection for our European citizens. We should also listen seriously to what Mr Watson underlined in his short speech, namely that the fight against terrorism is a common cause and that the people who experienced the terror attack in Toulouse should also be remembered in this House. We need to weigh up both arguments. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) clearly recognises the United States of America as our partner in the global challenge that is the fight against terror. We see the US as a partner and wish to work with it. I believe that we should avoid getting involved in this role play where the US is the bad guy that wants our data, while we Europeans reap the benefits of the results of the analyses, which will, after all, also be available to the European authorities. We must all shoulder our responsibilities, which means that we Europeans must take action. Every country has the sovereign right to decide how people enter its territory and what information it requires. Just as we are in discussions on this issue with Canada and Australia, so we are now also in discussions with the US. This agreement will offer us greater legal certainty. Anyone voting against the agreement is voting for less legal certainty. These are the alternatives on offer today. I would like to thank the Commissioner for making it clear that Europe is stronger when it acts collectively and that the European Union can achieve more than 27 countries negotiating separately. The PPE Group supports partnership with the US, which is why I would like to take a look towards the future. The reason why we are discussing a framework agreement on data protection is because the interchange of data will become more important in the future. For this reason, I would also call on the US to stay at the negotiating table and to take the Europeans’ offer seriously, so that we can draw up global standards for data exchange and data protection. If we in Europe and the US manage to conclude a joint framework agreement, then there is a chance that we will be able to establish global standards. This would represent genuine added value for the citizens of Europe. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Weber, Manfred  (PPE

 Mr Tavares, any criminal investigator working in the fight against terrorism will tell you that it is never one item of information that solves a case, but rather the overall picture built up. It is a question of how terror funds itself. It is a question of who has had phone contact with a terrorist. That is why we need to discuss data retention. It is also a question of the movement profile of a terrorist or possible perpetrator. The overall picture is what counts. I never claimed that just one data record would provide a result. What I did say, however, is that we need to uphold the data protection interests of our citizens, while at the same time considering what authority and what data we need to give to criminal investigators to enable them to do their job, namely to foil future terror attacks. Careful consideration is needed here. Those who reject the agreement today must also respect the fact that some data will simply remain unavailable. I said nothing more.

 Mr Albrecht, when I speak with criminal investigators, they tell me that we would have been unable to uncover a whole host of activities ahead of terrorist acts if it were not for our partnership with the US. This is what criminal investigators tell me. It is for this reason that I say that the United States of America is a partner of Europe in the joint war against terror. As I believe the United States to be a fair partner, I am happy to sit down with it to hammer out an agreement. This does not give carte blanche
 to all the countries of the world. If you are implying that we would equate our partnership with the United States with a partnership with China, then I am afraid I must disagree with you. I regard the United States as a true partner. I believe that this agreement will strengthen the Commission’s capacity to monitor the US and what it does with these data and whether it plays by the rules in implementing what has been agreed between us. I want a strong Europe. I also accept the United States as a fair partner that wishes to join us in the joint fight against terror.

 Unlawful? This question can be evaluated in political terms. You seem to disagree with me on this. If we take a look at the agreement, we have an organisation that has the right of initiative when it comes to negotiating an agreement and the resources to evaluate it, namely the Commission. The Commission’s legal services have stated that the agreement is in order. This is the legal situation. If others disagree, whether fellow Members of the House, Member States, or European governments, then they are completely at liberty to take the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union and to have it examined there. That is our legal system. I have absolutely no problem with that. However, to imply that a person is contradicting the law, despite the fact that the Commission’s legal services’ indicate that it is in order, is taking things too far. If this agreement is rejected, I am inclined to ask myself how you intend to explain to our citizens that we will find ourselves in a legal vacuum in which the United States will negotiate directly with the airlines and possibly even with the individual Member States. How will you explain to citizens that there are no longer any ground rules in relation to this data exchange issue. That is the issue facing us right now. Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have principles in the European Union, including the independence of the judiciary and the central bank and fundamental democratic rights. If there are any doubts about these fundamental rights or principles, we need to discuss them. The right place for these discussions is here in the European Parliament. For this reason, I would like to emphasise specifically how grateful I am to Mr Orbán, the Prime Minister of Hungary, for coming here. He was not invited. He said: I will take part in the discussion, because we have nothing to hide. I would like to emphasise too that Mr Orbán is here and is listening while many of those Members who were so hysterical and dramatic that they could hardly contain themselves have obviously already left the Chamber. He is still here and we should acknowledge that. If we leave the party politics to one side, the facts are quite simple: Europe has ground rules which apply to all of us. The job of the Commission is to ensure that everyone follows these rules and that is what it has done. The Hungarian Government has already promised on several occasions to deal with these problems and to make the necessary changes. These are the facts. If we could simply put aside the political hysteria, then we would be able to talk objectively about the situation. I have heard nothing new today from those on the left concerning the facts. Mr Swoboda stands up and says that the judiciary may be independent. Then I hear from Mr Orbán that there was absolutely no criticism of the constitution. Next Mr Verhofstadt says that this is not about individual legal details. It is about the fundamental question of whether Hungary is still democratic. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) stand for law and justice. If anyone has a criticism, they must substantiate it objectively and in terms of its content with regard to the judicial issues and not simply claim that someone has acted undemocratically. What we are experiencing in many areas is quite simply an arbitrary approach. If I do not like a specific aspect of the legislation in Hungary, I describe it as undemocratic, radical and right-wing or totalitarian. We in the PPE Group will not tolerate this. Finally, I would like to say that I have been working in this Parliament since 2004. I was involved with the case of Slovakia, which introduced a law banning the use of the Hungarian language there.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that is precisely the method which is preventing us from discussing the situation objectively. Personal attacks and defamatory statements are being made with regard to the subjects under discussion. I have no doubts about my fellow Member Mr Szájer and I have no reservations about his wife, although I do not know her. Also I would like to say that if we are really taking parliaments and parliamentarianism seriously, then the European Parliament must take seriously the decisions of the Hungarian Parliament, which has the support of a two-thirds majority of the citizens. This should also be taken into account in the discussion. (Applause) Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Swoboda, saying rather offensively as an Austrian and as Chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament that you are motivated by love of Hungary and then saying to the Prime Minister of the freely elected Hungarian Parliament that you are doing this out of love, I personally find rather impertinent. You are insinuating that the freely elected Prime Minister is not doing things out of love. Therefore, I would like to ask you how you come to say that you are acting only out of love of Hungary.

 Madam President, Commissioner, two weeks ago, the European Council met. After the summit, the Heads of State or Government appeared before the media and told the citizens of Europe how proud they were of Schengen and that they would defend Schengen against the attacks on it. When I heard these statements from our leading EU politicians, I thought to myself, ‘how bad have things got that it is now viewed as a success to defend Schengen?’ Schengen was a given that we had created in Europe, yet suddenly it is up for discussion again. The key question is how can we deal with the popularism we can sense on the Right? I think we need to take a two-pronged approach. The first element is that we need to convince people again that the project is right. We need to answer the assertion that security is improved through the introduction of border controls by explaining that it was only with the introduction of the Schengen Information System, through partnership and cooperation, that security was improved. I live in the border area between Bavaria and the Czech Republic. In my area, security has improved since border controls were abolished, as we now work with the Czech authorities. Even before abolishing the border controls, we have had more success in fighting crime in Romania and Bulgaria simply thanks to the exchange of information within the framework of the Schengen Information System. We need to convince people and win them back to the project. We need to win their hearts and I would like to see the Commission do more in this regard. Commissioner Malmström yesterday went on record saying that there had not been any problems so far in Denmark. While she may have been legally accurate, she offered too little political argument. We are not fighting for the hearts and minds of the people at this point in the way we should be. As Parliament, we can reassure the citizens that we take the Treaty of Lisbon seriously. We shall defend the Schengen agreement against all attacks that it may face with all the power we have as MEPs. If the Schengen acquis
 is to be amended, we shall ensure that it emerges from the changes stronger rather than weaker. Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the European Parliament is a very hard-working body, however we need to pay more attention to a balance in the voting times, so that we do not have a situation where there is nothing to vote on one day and an enormous number of votes the next. That is why I am now proposing that we should stop voting now and defer the remaining business to the next plenary sitting. (Applause)
 There are no issues on the agenda that are so pressing that a vote is absolutely necessary today. We have already voted on the legislative points. I believe that this was the most important thing for now. (Applause) Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, a lot has already been said with regard to Greece. I would just like to add two thoughts on this matter. The first is that, despite all the concern and fear being felt by the people, we must not lose sight of the principles. The two principles that define Europe are solidarity – we stand by this – and a sense of individual responsibility – that the Greek people and all those who receive acts of solidarity also take responsibility themselves. The second thought is that mention has been made of the big test for Europe and of the concern that the project could perhaps even fail and that old ghosts that we had thought we had eradicated could return to the European Union. I would like to turn all of this around and look at it in a positive light. We should not just talk about the problems, but also about the successes. For example, we should mention that some of the Baltic States have managed to overcome the crisis and that, with European support, Ireland will succeed in returning to the bond markets next year. This could also be a big opportunity to prove to the people that we are stronger together than we are alone. In this context, it is quite difficult to deal with the second major issue for the Council meeting, namely that of migration. However, there is a nice link that connects the two issues, because in relation to the migration issue, in particular Schengen, we also see the same principle at work, namely that one of Europe’s major successes is now being called into question as a result of national egotism. I am sure that we have all seen the figures indicating that 18 000 refugees have arrived in Italy. However, we all know that, for Italy, 18 000 refugees is hardly an excessive burden, because twice as many refugees have been received in the last year in Belgium alone. It was therefore not right of Italy to react in the way that it did. It was internal policymaking by Italy’s minister of reforms, Umberto Bossi. On account of a few hundred people, France responded by reintroducing border controls, and that, too, was for domestic political reasons. In Denmark, too, the reasons were of an internal political nature. I would therefore like clear signals to be sent out from the Council meeting. When the question of migration and Schengen is discussed, the Heads of State or Government of the European Union must respond with the clear message that we do not want national egotism, in particular in this area. Instead we want to defend the huge success that is a free Europe. Mr Barroso, you will certainly have Parliament’s support in that. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, fundamental human rights are universal, which means that they are applicable in every situation. I have been listening to the debate. None of the speakers so far, including the critics, has quoted the constitution to indicate exactly what it is they do not like. Mr López Aguilar says that he gets the impression that something has gone awry, while others are making insinuations about all the things that could go wrong with this constitution. Not one person has actually quoted from the constitution itself. That is precisely the problem that faces us in this discussion: where are the actual accusations? When I consider how the Hungarians will react to this debate and to the accusations being bandied about by some of my fellow Members without any support from direct quotations, then I can well imagine that some will find the way that the Hungarians and their country’s development are being discussed here to be extremely arrogant. As Europeans, we should take care to avoid leaving ourselves open to such accusations. I would like to state that many of those in positions of responsibility in Hungary today are the people who took to the streets to fight against communism and for liberty. It is simply unacceptable that accusations should be continuously made against these people and that the impression should be created that they are experiencing problems with freedom. This has nothing to do with party politics; it is simply a fact. Having complained that no quotes have been used during this debate, I would now like to quote from the new Hungarian constitution: ‘We are proud of the fact that our country has been part of Christian Europe for 1 000 years and we are aware of the role of Christianity in sustaining our nation’. I am pleased to find such sentiments in a constitution. This may not please all Members of this House. I am pleased that this reference to Christianity has been included and I would also have liked to have seen it included in the Treaty of Lisbon and in the European constitution. My position, as a representative of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is that this is a good thing. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).

Madam President, Mr Alvaro, you have just demonstrated how to extend your speaking time by accepting numerous questions. However, I would like to ask you whether you are aware that the provisions for the Hungarian constitutional court – I am not sure whether you have read the Hungarian constitution in its entirety – are almost identical to those that apply to the constitutional court in Germany. Therefore, I wanted to ask you whether the German constitutional court is just as undemocratic and worthy of criticism as the Hungarian constitutional court? I would like to hear your answer to this question. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, allow me to begin with a smile as I congratulate all the Members for having survived the fire alarm and managing to take our places, safe and sound, back in the Chamber. As a representative of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to pose a question to the President of the Commission, who has been busy dealing with the pictures that we have been seeing in recent weeks from the Mediterranean, where many people fleeing from the situation in Africa have made it to Europe, while some have also failed to make it. We have had to see the images of these stranded and dead people on the news. We are all aware that it is a joint European challenge facing us to find an answer to this drama and this misery for refugees. On behalf of the PPE Group, I would like to ask the President of the Commission to give us an appraisal of whether the Commission – and, above all, Frontex – has enough resources, whether we, the European Union, have enough capabilities to respond on the ground, and whether we have enough statutory bases to enable Europe to act together in the Mediterranean region. I would also be interested to hear what form the discussions with the countries of origin (Tunisia and Egypt, for example) take and whether we Europeans are making headway in this area. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, my thanks for your assessments of the situation. Given that you state that we currently need more resources for Frontex, I would be interested to hear whether you are not also of the opinion that the Member States have hitherto been too unwilling to provide the resources to make Frontex strong. We did have the toolbox already. Was it the case that there was too little willingness on the part of the Member States to support Frontex accordingly? Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, as has already been emphasised, Schengen is one of the great achievements of our common European project. Citizens notice it on a daily basis when travelling around Europe. It is the realisation of the dream of Europe – a Europe without border controls. It must therefore first be made clear in this debate – particularly in view of the debate that has taken place in recent weeks – that we in this House will jointly ensure that this principle and the idea behind it are not derailed by any initiative or any debate. We will defend this principle in the European Parliament. In recent weeks there have been discussions concerning more than 25 000 refugees from Tunisia who have arrived in the Italian territory of Lampedusa. Yet a country such as Sweden has been accepting more than 25 000 people a year for years on end. There have been states that have accommodated much greater numbers of people relative to their own population that is currently happening on the southern border of Europe, yet nobody has ever thought of questioning Schengen because of the burden. I would therefore like to clearly stress at this stage that it is a pity that we seriously need to have a debate in Europe, of all places, on Schengen status as a result of this challenge that we must deal with together. Secondly, I should like to make it clear that we practise solidarity. When it comes to countries such as Malta – a small country that is massively affected and which has no hinterland – then we are currently practising solidarity. In addition to this solidarity, however, I should like to stress that the second basic principle is the responsibility that the countries themselves have. I must therefore also ask the Commission to look more into this. If courts in the European Union are now ruling that Dublin II is to be ineffective – in other words, that refugees are not to be deported to their states of first arrival – then we must ask the Commission how committed it will be to taking action against those states that are obviously not currently implementing the existing law. We are talking here about minimum standards in the European Union. I am therefore calling on the Commission to take action here, too. As regards the preparation for the Council, I have just three points to make. The first is that when it comes to migration then naturally we must expect more migration in the long term as a result of demographic change, but here in the European Union we currently have 24 million people without work and in Spain the youth unemployment rate is 30%. We should therefore proceed cautiously – very cautiously – when it comes to the issue of migration. My second point concerns strengthening Frontex, as has already been mentioned. My third point is that I would ask us all to ensure that those states that were about to join Schengen, namely Bulgaria and Rumania, are not left behind because of the current debate. They have done the work; they have made efforts. We are not asking for lower standards for joining, but if they meet the standards then it is only fair that Bulgaria and Rumania also have the right to become members of the Schengen area. Manfred Weber,

Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, transparency is a cornerstone of democracy, ensuring that people know who exerts influence and how decisions are made. Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament has significantly more power. That is why it is right that our modus operandi
 should always be open to debate and that we should question ourselves. The negotiations between the European Parliament and the Commission in relation to the transparency register are a success and we have now produced an excellent result. I would like to underline once again that it is good that we have found clear regulations for the local and regional authorities, and even for churches, that reflect their interests. I would also like to say that we do not regard lobbyism as something bad per se. We need expert opinions and we need to be able to call on experts for our work. In the end it is important that we, as parliamentarians, should be able to consider issues freely and make decisions independently. I would now like to state that we parliamentarians have a lot to be proud of. If we conduct a national comparison, we will see that there are only a few Member States of the European Union who have already established a transparency register at this level. In my country’s capital, Berlin, where I also happen to live, there is no such transparency register, which is why we should all be aware that this is a truly significant step forward. To the Council I would say: if this issue is not a problem for the Council because lobbyists have very little influence there, then it should be easier for it to sign up to the transparency register. Accordingly, the Council may be able to conquer its internal resistance. Finally, Madam President, I would point out that if we in Parliament want to escape the influence of lobbyists to a greater extent in future, then we will need greater supports and more staff, enabling us to achieve more for the citizens of the European Union. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).

Mr President, Mr Barroso, the necessary Treaty modification and the institutional debate that we are holding both demonstrate that, now the Treaty of Lisbon has been in force for just over a year, we can no longer resolve the challenges which the world is presenting us with by means of the Treaty as it currently stands. That is exactly what today’s debate shows. On the other hand, when we talk about the current Treaty, we are told that a wider debate about the Treaty is inconceivable and futile in the light of the situation in the Member States and, in particular in the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic. That is the conflict which we currently find ourselves in. We need more, but we will not be getting it from the Member States. The European Parliament must provide an answer. If we listen to what the citizens are saying today, it is clear that they are aware that we need to introduce changes to the Treaty now. They are asking questions like: ‘How are we going to get the markets under control in the near future?’. This is why we need a strong Europe. However, we must ask ourselves an even more important question, which is: What good is our European project doing at the end of the day? For decades, it has been responsible for peacekeeping and for bringing war on our continent to an end. This morning, I was host to a group of visitors from a school. For young people, war is, thank goodness, no longer an issue. They cannot imagine what war might be like. In our discussions, we now raise the threat of globalisation and explain that we need Europe to keep the evil of globalisation under control, but this is a negative argument. If we want to win over not only the minds, but also the hearts of the people, we must take a step further on the question of what good the European project is doing. We must talk about the pictures and ask ourselves what Europe is achieving and what its job is. When the powerful countries in the world come together, including America, Japan, Europe, Brazil, India and so on, who will raise their hand and ask whether we are paying enough attention to social issues? China will not do so. We will have to do that ourselves. Who will raise their hand and say ‘We need to think about environmental questions’? The Americans will not do that. We will have to highlight the issue. Who will say ‘We want to maintain peace throughout the world and ensure that conflicts do not turn into wars’? We will have to do this with our historical experience. If we look at Tunisia, it is clear that the people there want the same model which we have in Europe. We have a highly attractive way of life. Therefore, when we discuss Treaty issues, when we talk about the way in which our continent functions and the job that we have to do, we must look at the big picture, so that we win not only the minds, but also the hearts of people for our project. Then, we will succeed in gaining acceptance for it at a national level. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule149(8)) Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, on the one hand, it is important that the Member States are in control of the treaties, which is why the modification must take place at this level. On the other hand, we are faced with the question which is implicit in many of the questions that I have attempted to address. Are we reflecting carefully on this, are we taking enough time and being allowed enough time to discuss everything in detail? Or are people’s expectations so high and the pressure of the global challenges so great that we need to be quicker and to act more quickly? For this reason, I do not regard the issue of time as a problem, but we do need to provide answers. We must focus on that. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, asylum policy is a highly topical issue, as we have recently discovered in Lampedusa and in Greece. It is a subject that concerns the people of Europe. We should be proud of what we have achieved in Europe, including our common standards, the proper processing of asylum applications and our way of dealing with children and families. We should be proud of all of this. Europe is an area which offers help and partnership to people suffering persecution all over the world. However, the decisive factor is not what we put on paper in Parliament’s committees, in the Commission and in the Council, but what actually happens on the ground. Belgium and Greece have recently been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for not implementing and not adhering to existing legislation. This makes it clear that the enforcement process is not working. I would like to ask the Commission to make faster progress, alongside its existing action plans. We need to be able to put in place and implement the important standards more quickly within the European Union. In the specific case of Greece, I would like to point out that we have a border that can be secured from both sides. I am disappointed in the way our partner, Turkey, has behaved in this respect. We have signed a readmission agreement with Turkey, which requires the country to do far less than it would have to if it were a member of the European Union. Therefore, I think we should expect Turkey to make a greater effort in this area. No one disputes our sense of solidarity. We want to provide practical help in the form of the European Refugee Fund and Frontex, both in the case of Greece, where aid is already being provided, and in the case of Lampedusa in Italy. European solidarity is not being called into question. It is needed now more than it ever has been. Manfred Weber,  
author.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would also like to use today’s debate to take a general look at the visa policy of the European Union. Firstly, it is important to emphasise, to make ourselves aware, of the great value of this visa policy to the European Union. Since we are a common Europe, a common space for people, we are able to create a common visa policy. Our visa policy is therefore also a sign of European unity – a very successful sign of European unity – and it is important to point that out, particularly in times of crisis. Secondly, we are calling for clear rules of play when it comes to visa facilitation. The technical standards that are to be maintained – at external borders and when issuing passports and identity papers – are clearly set out. We cannot make any political concessions as regards the upholding of these standards. In 2010, we found that in the Balkans, there was initially a focus on technical standards, but political arguments were then advanced with increasing vigour. When it comes to visa facilitation, however, one cannot stop at one country; we have to view the area as a whole. Yes, it is always difficult for us to weigh things up in an individual case. However, the core of the issue is that the technical standards must be upheld; the criteria must remain. I therefore also support our Commissioner when she says that these standards that we are demanding must also be implemented in reality. That is an important task of the Commission, because only then will our visa policy be accepted by our citizens. Thirdly, I would like to mention that we welcome the fact that the last European Justice and Home Affairs Council discussed enabling visa facilitation to be rapidly lifted or withdrawn from individual states if they fail to implement the standards. The example of Serbia showed us that the result was a great influx of asylum seekers. Moving on to my final point, for the time being – when talking about Ukraine and Russia – our group is highly sceptical as regards opening the doors quickly, because we have just seen in the case of Serbia that there will also be negative effects. We should therefore proceed with great caution when it comes to visa policy. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, on the subject of Pakistan: we are debating this at a difficult time for Pakistan, and all of us, I believe, support complete solidarity with the people there who have suffered this disaster. Mr Sógor has already talked specifically about the agreement. Therefore, I would like to make a few comments on the questions relating to European Union readmission agreements with third countries in general. Firstly, these agreements make sense and they are necessary, because we have legislation in Europe that governs immigration. However, if we have legislation that governs immigration then there will also be people who are residing here illegally. It then follows logically that we also need to have repatriation. With regard to many of the principles I have just stated, the Left – the Socialists – are often on our side, but when it comes to specific decisions regarding the actual conclusion of such an agreement, they then refuse to give their consent. I therefore believe that, despite this, we need to remain consistent. Secondly, standard human rights must be respected. The alternative to such an agreement is not, of course, that we have better human rights standards. Anyone who rejects this agreement accepts the fact that we will have 27 different legal standards in the European Union which are not monitored as closely as would be the case at European level. The third, and for me the most important, question is: how can we actually make partnership with third countries attractive in future? I would ask the Commission to work in a more interconnected way in future. If we open up European markets in the world trade negotiations, the third countries must also give us the opportunity to talk about repatriation or, with regard to the question of legal immigration, third countries must be in a position to grant us concessions in connection with repatriation. In other words, a more interconnected way of working is important here. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was no coincidence that we, as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), allowed our colleague, Mrs Járóka, who is the only representative of the Roma minority in this Parliament, to speak first today. This is because the PPE Group would much prefer to talk about the people’s problems today. We do not want to make a political show – we do not care about Mr Sarkozy – we want to discuss the problems we are facing with the Roma minority and how we can help them. This is also the basis of our resolution. Mr Swoboda, you said that it is scandalous that the Commission has drawn this conclusion. All I can say to that is that it is clearly scandalous to you because the Commission is not joining in with the political show that you want to make of this and has made a serious comment on the situation. Secondly, as regards the freedom of movement, everything has been said already. We have clear ground rules in the European Union. The freedom of movement is not without limit; it can be restricted on an individual basis and that is also what has been done in France. My third point is actually the important one. In the political debate on this issue, it is a question of how we can integrate the minorities in Europe into our societies. If we all accept the fact that we are open-minded and tolerant, then we are on common ground. If, as a second step, we also all accept that around 90% move towards the majority society, that we really join together and take integration seriously, then we are also still in agreement. We are divided on the question of how we should deal with migrants – regardless of what sort of migrants – who just do not accept what the majority society has to offer, who refuse to cooperate, and will not accept the ground rules. The Left in this House repeatedly presents the argument that we need to offer these people something. We in the PPE Group say that the migrants also need to accept the offers. If you do not add this requirement and stipulate it in strong terms, if you do not have a state that calls for this, then you destroy the willingness of citizens to integrate people, and you do the handiwork of the Right in this House if you do not permit the state to use this toughness. It is also permissible to say that. (Applause)

 Mr President, thank you for the question. The answer is also quite simple. The question of whether a law has been transposed is not decided in Europe by politicians, or by journalists. In the European Union, it is the courts that decide. In the European Union – and in France, too – we have a situation in which people belonging to the Roma groups concerned can turn to the courts and file a complaint against this on an individual basis. That has already been done. The Commissioner has pointed out that French judges also use European law as the basis for their decisions. Thus, it is not journalists who decide whether or not laws have been implemented in this European Union, it is the courts, and according to the Commission’s statement, that is clearly the way it works in France just as it does in the other Member States of the European Union. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to talk about freedom of expression in the European Union is to cover a broad subject area. I thank the Commission for the broad approach to this matter. This is a debate about principles. From my own country, Germany, I can report that one political party, a political power, namely the Social Democrats, owns newspapers and publishing houses, in other words, it has large newspapers under its control. We citizens repeatedly ask ourselves whether it is good for parties to own parts of the media or whether it would actually be better for these two to be separate. Thus, there is a great deal to discuss with regard to this issue. However, I would like to use today’s debate to talk instead about principles. The media are part of the foundation of our democracy. They inform people of factual circumstances and they scrutinise those who hold power. Of course, this task performed by the media also brings with it a large responsibility to use this power in a responsible manner. In this regard, it is important to protect peoples’ privacy and it is important that news is not reported in order to create a sensation, but to provide reliable information. In that respect, the media are part of the foundation of our civil democracy. Independence is what is most important here. Publishers must grant their journalists independence. In the national structures that we have – we as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) view this as positive, because the media are also part of our culture – we need independence from political influence, and neither must advertising customers influence the work of editorial staff. If we take a look at the reality of journalism today, one of the greatest challenges for independent journalism is probably the subject of the Internet, in other words, the ability to access information on the Internet free of charge without knowing whether this information is correct or incorrect. That is a major challenge. In order to maintain high quality journalism, which we need to ensure, even in the age of the Internet, we must uphold the copyright of the journalists who supply high quality work. This is a key challenge for the future. Manfred Weber,

 Mr President, different types of fruit take differing amounts of time to ripen.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, in its session today, the Commission approved the new SWIFT agreement, and did so by a large majority or even unanimously. I would like to ask the President of the Commission – since I am sure he is aware that many of our citizens are concerned about data being passed on – where he sees substantial progress and how we can convince our citizens of the necessity of this agreement. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I just have a brief supplementary question. It concerns the content of the agreement that you have presented. I would like to repeat my previous question. What are the implications of this agreement for transatlantic relations? How important is it for the other topics that we need to discuss with the US? If you could give us an idea of this, I would be very grateful. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).  
– (DE) 
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr López Garrido, I too would firstly like to make a short comparison with the SWIFT debate. I was quite delighted to hear the representative of the Council talk of dedicated objectives in negotiations for this new SWIFT agreement. I am therefore quite surprised by the sort of effect and power the Treaty of Lisbon and the statement by Parliament have had on the Council, which now wants to champion the interests of Europe. I hope that we experience the same momentum now when we are talking about Passenger Name Record data, and that here there is also a commitment to fighting on behalf of European interests. Secondly, I would like to say that I believe we all agree that from the point of view of legal certainty for both airlines and citizens, when it is a question of data protection rights, such agreements make sense. The standards that we want have been set out clearly in the joint resolution. Thirdly, I would like to mention a point that is not directly connected with the agreements, but definitely relates to the subject, in other words, the debate in the Council as to whether we also need or should develop a European PNR system. The last major terror threat in Europe was the Detroit case when an attacker boarded a plane and wanted to fly to Detroit. That happened last year before Christmas. In this case, we learned that in the United Kingdom, we knew that this person was a threat. However, those who decided whether he could fly or not did not have the necessary information to hand. What I want to say here is that I believe that in the European Union, the problem is not whether there is enough data available. I believe that we already know who poses a threat. The problem is getting the data to where we need it in order to prevent threats. In Toledo, the Spanish Presidency proposed – and I am grateful for this – that we strengthen the networking of counter terrorism authorities in Europe. Unfortunately, this proposal was not taken up by the European interior ministers. Instead, there was the proposal to build new data sets and gather new data. It often seems to me that for the interior ministers, collecting new data is the easy option. I would firstly ask you to attend to the networking of the authorities involved; then we would achieve a lot in the fight against terror. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schulz said that Greece has delivered and that it is now Europe’s turn. I wonder whether Europe actually needs to say ‘thank you’, nowadays, if Member States in the euro area simply keep to the rules, in other words, if they manage to get back to the 3% criterion. I also wonder what the difference was last year when Ireland faced the same situation and instituted hard cuts. Nobody came forward at that time with the idea of calling on a European Monetary Fund. Mr Verhofstadt says that speculators are at work. Clearly there is pressure in that regard at the moment, but the fact is that Greece enjoyed major rate advantages thanks to being in the euro area. Our Italian colleagues used the rate advantage they gained from their accession to the euro area to consolidate. Greece consumed it. We can indeed therefore say that the good European today is not the one who is putting his or her money on the table; the good European is the one who actually implements the rules that everyone has signed up to and accepted, so that they are actually complied with in the European Union. As a second point, I would like to give my backing to the Commission because the proposals that are on the table for the long-term future represent a move in the right direction. We have agreed the 3% and we therefore need a strong Commission that will, in future, monitor and also enforce that 3% limit. We have seen how the Member States in the euro area are unable to police each other and to observe the 3% limit on their own. That is why I am in favour of a strong Commission that will be able, in future, to see that the criteria are met. I have one more thought. We should talk positively about the euro. It is not a currency crisis that we have; it is an economic crisis. The euro is a major benefit for everyone. If our leaders in the European Union no longer say that, if that point is no longer made in the Council, people will not know it. That is why I am in favour of this major, strong currency. Manfred Weber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, that is very helpful. Thank you very much for making this possible. If I have understood things correctly, because this is a sensitive issue that we are discussing, then Mr Rubalcaba cannot assure us that the existing agreement will not come into force. In other words, if we postpone matters and give ourselves more time, it will come into effect. Therefore, my next question is: Can Mr Rubalcaba assure us that, for example, a long-term agreement will be in place within a month with higher standards or is the Council telling us that we must still wait nine months until the end of the period? It is very hard for Parliament to accept an unconditional assurance. Therefore, we must have clear conditions relating to the Council’s assurance, in order to be able to decide tomorrow about a possible postponement. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mr Rubalcaba, Commissioners, I am pleased that we are not only talking about SWIFT and body scanners today, but also having a general debate on the war on terror, because this is a subject that affects us all. Looking back, we have to say that terrorism is a real threat to the people of Europe. We are taking positive action and I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the public authorities. The people who are responsible for security have done a good job over recent years. I would also like to thank our partners. Now we must look to the future. What will we be faced with over the next few years? In this respect, I have three specific requests or proposals. The first concerns cooperation among the authorities in Europe. Every document comes with a headline emphasising the importance of collaborating and strengthening our cooperation. These are wonderful words, but nothing has happened in practice. Once again nothing happened in Toledo with regard to practical cooperation. There is no lack of action – this has been made clear in Detroit. What we are lacking is cooperation between the authorities. That is where the problem lies. Therefore, I would like to ask the Council finally to do its job in this area and to call on the Commission to put some appropriate proposals on the table. My second point is that we should investigate our existing legislation with regard to the collection of data and mobile phone data, for example, in the case of the retention of data. For this reason, you have the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for this evaluation. After an interval of a few years, it is important to put it to the test. Thirdly, we have just had a discussion about SWIFT. I would like to ask the House why our cooperation with the United States has to be organised in this way. It has to be organised like this because we Europeans are not in the position to evaluate the data ourselves. Therefore, the question arises as to whether we are self-confident enough to evaluate it ourselves. This is another thought for the future. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr López Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, this whole debate was, of course, initially coloured by the frustration and irritation that many people in the European Parliament felt because we had the impression that, once again, things were being rushed through in the Council before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. For that reason, I am now thankful that the Council has realised that it is good to consult Parliament, to now apply the new Treaty of Lisbon in the ratification process and also to give us the opportunity to assess whether this agreement is to be applied or not. In this legislative process, if we now start it, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will apply clear decision-making criteria. There are two sides to the coin. On one side, we as the PPE Group hold the clear principle that for European data – wherever this is stored – European data protection standards should apply. We hold the principle that we want a right of appeal for people who feel they have been unfairly treated in being subjected to data checks. We hold the basic principle that data should be passed on only in individual cases and only if the person is suspected of something, not simply as a general rule. These are things that we regard as important. On the other side of the coin, there is the fact that we, of course, want cooperation with the United States. We want to cooperate with our partners in the fight against terror. We do not want a situation in which individual states – if agreements expire – are put under particular pressure, like Belgium for example, because then states might start to operate on a bilateral basis. Careful consideration is also needed here. As the PPE Group, we will give consideration to this when the legislative proposal is presented. I would ask the Council and the Commission once again not to play for time, but to send the text now so that we can deal with it. As Parliament, we are capable of working quickly and we will be able to deal with this quickly. Then it will be up to the ministers – and just to make this very clear: the interior ministers – to convince Parliament that these methods that are now being proposed in this agreement really are necessary for the fight against terror. We are open to this process, but the task of convincing us is still to be done by the executive, in other words the ministers. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to look at the procedural argument. I would like to remind everyone that we have just voted on the Cashman report. This is a report created by Parliament in the course of an ongoing legislative procedure. Our Legal Service has stated that this is not permitted, but the socialists insisted on introducing it. While we were discussing the freedom of the press in Italy and the Commissioner responsible explained that the European Union has no authority in this area, the socialists still felt that it was worthwhile to attack Berlusconi. Whenever it suits the socialists, it is a question of there being no authority. Whenever other people are being opposed, the authority is in place. For this reason, we should not give in to them. However, the second argument is worthy of serious discussion. Are we responsible for the Convention on Human Rights? I would like to remind my fellow Members that, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union will become party to the Convention on Human Rights. This means that if it is legitimate for the Italian Parliament to discuss this, because Italy is party to the Convention on Human Rights, then it is also legitimate for the European Parliament to discuss this, as it will be party to the Convention on Human Rights in future. My third and final argument concerns the fact that we are not lawyers, we are politicians. This judgment affects millions of people and, therefore, we should vote on it today. (Applause) Manfred Weber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, I am grateful for the opportunity to hold this debate. Mr López Aguilar referred to the fact that in his opinion, as a lawyer, we are not responsible. I am not speaking as a lawyer, but as a politician. Millions of people in Europe are affected by this judgment by the judges in Strasbourg. This is why it is a good thing that we are discussing it here. The relationship between church and state in Europe has always been disputed and has led to bloody conflicts. It is right and proper that the European Union has managed to separate the state from religion. This is a good thing. However, we have a wide range of different models in Europe. France is clearly a non-religious state, while in Great Britain, the Head of State, the Queen, is also the head of the church. We have different models of how the relationship between church and state has developed. For this reason, I believe it is a good thing that we are calling for subsidiarity in this area and that every country can go its own way. I would even like to take things a step further. I do not want to talk about subsidiarity, but about the basic issue that, from my perspective, the European values of solidarity, subsidiarity and freedom are unthinkable without a foundation in Christianity and in the Judaeo-Christian understanding of religion. Why do we not find these values in China or in the Middle East? This is because they are based on our culture and our religions. It is possible to mention this without forcing anyone to accept the same faith. We are proud of our religious freedom. There is religious freedom in the sense that it is possible for me to decide to be an atheist. That is acceptable and legitimate and we have fought for this. However, there is also the right to have a faith. In my region, where more than one million people live, over 80% are Catholics. Just as atheists call for others to show them tolerance, so the Catholics who make up more than 80% of the population are calling for non-believers to be tolerant of their faith. They want to be able to show their faith in public, to represent it and to have Christian symbols accepted by the minority in this majority society. This is also legitimate in terms of religious freedom. Anyone who calls for tolerance must also show tolerance to those who practise a Christian faith. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, I have been here in the European Parliament for 5 years now, and I work in the field of internal affairs and the law. Today, therefore, is a day of joy for me, when we have the opportunity to debate the programmes for the next five years, when we will be able to deliberate on this future as a European Parliament on an equal legislative footing. We are discussing a dossier, a subject area, that exercises the public, where the public expect answers from us, where they even say that this is an area where we need more Europe. That is not so for every subject area, but in this case it is. They are making demands of us. They want answers from us. I therefore want to very briefly describe the change that will result from the new working basis and these subjects. The first point is working with the Council. We always have representatives of the Council here and they always tell us, as Presidents-in-Office of the Council, that Parliament is very important and that we must work together. When they leave that role, however, that understanding often crumbles away. It will be our job, as parliamentarians, to demand of the Council that it no longer allow this understanding to slip away, or for it – as with the SWIFT agreement, for example – to create precedents, despite not involving us here in Parliament in the approval process. That cannot, and in future, will not, be the situation any longer. It was a bad example of the institutions taking each other seriously. My second point is that we must be creators of ideas. The new treaty gives us the opportunity to table legislative initiatives. If we want to strengthen Frontex, we cannot just call for things to happen and just make proposals, we must also put legislation on the table. In future, we will have the opportunity to do that. My third point is that we also need to be a serious partner, one that does not just draw up wish lists. If, for example, we are dealing with the fight against illegal migration, we must not just take on NGO positions, we must be a serious partner. Finally, the European Parliament must take subsidiarity seriously. If we have competence, we must also consider which subject areas would be better dealt with at the national or regional level. These are four subjects that I think are important for the forthcoming few years. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would have liked the proposals for the Stockholm Programme to have been much more ambitious still, but today is a day to rejoice that we are entering this new phase, and all that remains to be said is let us get on with the work! Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group. 
– (DE) 
Mr President, I should like to support and speak in favour of the motion. Not every issue in Europe is an issue for Europe. We practise subsidiarity and we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) have confidence in our colleagues in the parliament in Rome and trust in the Roman courts, in the Italian courts, which can rule independently on what is good for Italy and what is not good for Italy. The Italian parliament has just proven that it is independent. We are happy to debate freedom of opinion, but then we should also debate freedom of opinion in the European Union. That must be clear in the motion and its title, which is why we are asking for support for our motion. Manfred Weber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of Mr Mauro’s persuasive speech, suddenly even Mr Schulz has conceded that it would be a good thing for us to talk about Europe as a whole now. Alas, the title of today’s debate is Italy. I can absolutely see why many of you have no interest in talking about Europe as a whole. If, for example, I were to look at the media interests of Germany’s Social Democrats, I would observe that they own 90% of the newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau
 and that the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) owns 57% of the Neue Westfälische
 newspaper and holds an interest in the WAZ media group. The largest source of income for the SPD today is its media interests. I can therefore absolutely see why many of you have no interest in talking about ownership in other cases, but instead only want to discuss Italy. This debate is fizzling out because of the situation in Italy and the positive statements that we are hearing. I am not Italian, as you can tell when I speak, but the most convincing argument that comes to my mind is the question of what was the matter between 2006 and 2008 when Italy had a leftist government and, of course, at that time – as Mr Mauro has pointed out – everything was fine and dandy. There were no legislative proposals tabled by the then government to finally end the concentration of the media, though the power was there. Today, when there is once again a clear majority for the conservative parties in Italy, there are suddenly problems again. This debate must not give way to dishonesty. As long as the socialists, the leftists in this House, no longer have arguments to back us into a corner, I can very happily carry on with this debate! Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Western Balkans need Europe and we Europeans need stability in the Western Balkans. The Western Balkans are a central part of Europe and we must do our utmost to bring this important part back home to Europe. For that reason, these are the right proposals. The reality of life in this area has been described; the depressingly long queues at visa offices, the young people with no prospect of making an application to leave the country and get a taste of life in Europe. A lot of people experience this area as a prison, where they have no contact with the outside world. We all want to put an end to this and, in my group, Mrs Pack, Mrs Bildt and Mr Posselt are working on this with a great deal of dedication. We all stand for this. What worries us is that, as a result of the different treatment of the states in this area, there will be separatist movements and different classes of citizens in the area of the Western Balkans will be created, which could certainly lead to problems. However, the citizens in the European Union equally expect security. That means that the standards that Commissioner Barrot described here today, namely security standards for police cooperation, in the fight against illegal immigration and economic migration and for biometric data, are the agreed minimum standards which represent the rules of play. Our citizens expect those rules of play to be adhered to. That brings me to my second point: there must be no foreign policy concessions on the question of visa waiver. We should not give these states a free rein. The rules of play are clear and anyone who abides by them has every chance of having visas waived. The pressure on the states which have been unable to improve their standards hitherto, despite EU aid, should not let up. These are the two flanks that we in the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) consider to be right. We trust in the evaluation that the European Commission has carried out and can therefore approve the present step. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, during this debate many people have expressed their gratitude to the Czech Presidency for the fact that it has still managed to complete a few projects, in administrative terms, by the end of its term of office. I ask myself in all seriousness: have we really become so modest in our expectations? We are in the business of politics. What we actually expect, in the greatest economic crisis for decades which is combined with environmental challenges, is a Presidency which shows leadership and vision. That is what we really expect. We have seen that the administrative work has been completed for what is still on the table at end of the term of office. I really would have expected more. Prime Minister, if you meet with President Klaus this evening, please tell him that had an opportunity during these six months to make the Czech national identity and sovereignty clear to Europe by showing strong leadership. He did of course promote the importance of national sovereignty here in Parliament. Unfortunately, he missed the opportunity. Markus Ferber,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that, through today’s debate on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments, we have advanced into the core area for financial market regulation within this legislative period; now we need to regulate the financial markets and not just look at individual products, as we did in the past. I just want to pick out a few key terms. In the last year we have not made life easy for ourselves. We have conducted a hearing in committee, we have surveyed all the stakeholders and every interested group, and on this basis, through various processes, working documents and the like, produced a result which we are setting before this plenary session here today and tomorrow. I will take a few points from it. Firstly, market structure. On the one hand, we must concede that in recent years something has happened in the financial markets which has made it in Parliament’s interest that each trade in securities takes place under the MiFID rules, which is why we have approved a new category – bounded by many conditions – called Organised Trading Facilities, where only non-equities can be traded, where proprietary trading is forbidden and where, with regard to execution, transaction and customer interaction, execution may take place at the operator’s discretion. Through this process I think that we are making an important contribution to ensuring that the entire area of traded OTC papers is handled within the MiFID environment. Another major subject not considered in the last MiFID is algorithmic or high-frequency trading. Once again, we needed to issue clear rules here, so that these areas, which can be very dangerous and can be manipulatively employed, is subject to a strict system with minimum holding periods, trade interruption opportunities, the option to test algorithms, the option of examining algorithms within the supervisory structure, the introduction of tick-size regimes, a minimum price, and corresponding fee systems.  Another subject I would like to touch on is the area of commodities futures markets. I do believe that we have a particular responsibility here, when it comes to restricting the speculative part of commodities futures markets, not to contribute through bad regulation to a situation where people in the third and fourth worlds can no longer buy food. Because of this, we have chosen a two-pronged approach with the aim of curbing speculation but not thereby damaging the real economy. We want to achieve this by using position limits with strict ceilings on the number of contracts or positions. We also want to ensure, by means of the position-check system, that those who can prove that they really need a product do not suddenly speculate in this market. Another issue that concerns us is the area of investor protection. I would like to point out here that we have chosen a very broad approach in guaranteeing protection for consumers and investors. This means that the requirements of specific customer groups need to be identified. Not every small saver needs access to highly complex papers. What is needed is to define the relevant products for target groups, carry out product testing, make telephone recordings, give relevant advice, disclosure requirements, but – I want to briefly mention – to proceed, with regard to commissions, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. Member States should be able, according to their structures, to make relevant accommodations. I think we are on the right track here. My time is running out, so I thank everyone who has been involved. I think it is a shame that we only have four minutes’ speaking time for such a complex report. I thank all my colleagues who collaborated on this and the Commission for the very constructive role it has played in recent weeks and months. I hope that a strong vote in the plenary session tomorrow will put us in a situation to negotiate with the Council in order to resolve this important report as soon as possible. Markus Ferber,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief. Firstly, I am pleased that I have such wide support, from the extreme left to the extreme right. I do not know whether this is a good thing – but perhaps it is helpful to have found a compromise in the middle.  Secondly, I want to point out here that we are talking about financial market regulation. Therefore, it depends on which markets trading takes place on. Trading in financial products always involves risk: there is no such thing as a risk-free financial market. If you demonise financial markets per se, you will be unhappy with any regulation. This was not our intention. It was our intention, on the one hand, to ensure that every trade in financial products takes place within a regulated framework and, on the other hand, that these financial markets generate added value for the economy and do not exist purely for their own sake. If we have anything to learn from the time before 2008 it is that financial markets acted independently and did not generate any added value for the real economy – this has been the painful experience of recent years. As a result, we have produced something together. My heartfelt thanks, therefore, go to all the shadow rapporteurs who collaborated on this report. We will have the privilege of holding meetings with the Council over the coming months in order to produce a good result. I hope that we can take the good spirit we have maintained in discussions over almost a year into those negotiations. Markus Ferber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is important that we as the European Parliament grapple very hard with the European Semester – after all, we introduced it when we negotiated the ‘six-pack’. Why? I believe that we in Europe have not been suffering from formulating the rules of the game together but rather we are suffering from the fact that, in the end, the rules are not being applied as they were formulated at the European level. Parliament ought to lead this process very strongly and also to continue to touch on the sore points where things are not working as agreed.  I think that the report before us – for which I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, in particular – provides an important indicator of what can be improved in the interaction between Member States, national parliaments, the European Parliament, the Commission, which must oversee the whole procedure, and the processes that then take place in the Member States. We must now cooperate to use all the euphoria, the spirit of optimism – that is right, we want to make things better for the future – and this momentum, if we want Europe to learn lasting lessons from the financial, economic and national debt crisis. There are many, many important contributions here, both in the individual reports from the Commission to the Member States and in the work we at Parliament have produced.  Many thanks to the rapporteur for this. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) emphatically supports this report. However, over the coming weeks, months and years we will ensure not only that many documents are written but that policy is implemented in the interests of European citizens and taxpayers. Markus Ferber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should concentrate on today’s subject, and forget about things that are off topic. What are we discussing today? We are discussing how we want to bring Parliament and the Member States together in order to establish strict ground rules that will not go the way of all things European, which is to say that, while they may be adopted here, when it comes to application, they no longer play a major role, as we have already experienced in many, many cases – not only with the euro, but elsewhere, too. We want to establish ground rules that really oblige the Member States to do things that are urgently necessary, in order to guarantee that which states were originally created to provide, namely, guaranteeing infrastructure, education, employment, social security and many other things for the people, although not at the expense of future generations or other Member States. We should therefore not do the other thing proposed in numerous amendments, which is to say, we should not accompany this obligation with the development of any new sources of funding that have only one purpose, namely, to reward those who have not kept to the rules hitherto and punish those who have. A Europe on that basis will not work in the long term. Europe will only work if everyone adheres to the ground rules agreed. The idea of a debt redemption fund must therefore be rejected. Such a fund punishes those who kept their houses in order, to the benefit of those who did not. The idea of eurobonds must therefore be rejected. Such bonds punish those who acted properly and adhered to the rules and reward those who did not. These sections should therefore be rejected. Markus Ferber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with all the problems relating to the details that we could talk about, and which we will be talking about, in the further legislative procedure, we should not lose sight of one thing: financial markets cannot function according to a model in which, when everything is going well, the banks take the profits, and then, when something goes wrong, taxpayers have to pick up the tab. That is why it makes sense for there also to be a tax on financial transactions. It also makes sense for this to be done in a cross-border arrangement. In Europe – or at least in the euro area – this would not result in distortions; rather, it would make a lasting contribution to bringing about a stable financial market which generates what financial markets are actually there for, namely, to provide enterprises with access to capital, to allow savers to save or put something aside for their old age, and so that the financial markets can once again do the job for which they were once created, which is to provide added value for the real economy. Everything that drove us into the financial crisis consisted of products that added no value for the real economy. That is why it makes sense to have a tax that can be used to help ensure that this is severely penalised, that sanctions are taken, that steers us towards a situation in which capital goes back to doing its job. That is why I am advocating that we adopt this proposal today with a broad majority. Markus Ferber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must put an end to a few of the fairytales that are often told here. Fairytale number 1: austerity policies are cold and heartless and push people into social exclusion. That is not true. Austerity policies involve creating opportunities, so that future generations have the chance to do the jobs that they need to do. While the policy in some areas is sustainable, what has repeatedly been said here about financial policy is not sustainable at all. Fairytale number 2: eurobonds are the solution to all our problems. In fact, eurobonds are a sweet-tasting poison. They provide those people with money under favourable terms who can no longer obtain it elsewhere under favourable terms, so that they can run up even more debts. This is why we must categorically reject eurobonds. Fairytale number 3: all our problems will be solved by a debt redemption fund. Just to make it clear what we are talking about, a debt redemption fund means that the Member States generate surpluses per se
, so that they can make use of the fund. During the repayment period, they cannot accumulate any new debts, otherwise the whole system will cease to function. We need to look more closely at the truth and the reality before we start calling for model solutions. For this reason, the only possibility for offering people lasting future prospects and for defending the European social model on an ongoing basis in competition with other economic areas is to increase our competitiveness. We will not do this by relying more heavily on the state. Instead, we need to give companies the opportunity to invest money, for example, by selling building plots where people know that what they build on the plot will belong to them, as an illustration of the problem in Greece, and where they know that the state will not constantly be intervening with non-tariff trade barriers to limit their growth, as an illustration of the problem in France. We can only increase our competitiveness by overcoming the challenges on global markets and Germany is a good example of this. Markus Ferber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should stop acting as if we can save the world every time we get together in Strasbourg. Once again, we have a proposal on the table, and once again we are saving the world, the climate, our resources and who knows what else – even though we have already done it before elsewhere. It makes no sense to do the same thing over and over again. That is why I want to state very clearly that it makes no sense – as the Commissioner has said – to burden aviation, where we have a functioning emissions certificate trading system that we hope will also soon be effective internationally, with an additional tax. It makes no sense to include shipping, which has ideal alternative options, in this tax. It makes no sense to engineer a compromise between energy density and CO2
 emissions. Excuse me for saying so, but as an engineer, I must point out that high energy density means lower CO2 
emissions per kilometre travelled. Penalising this correlation twice is equally non-sensical. I therefore have to say that the Commission proposal has not been fully thought out. What the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs approved by a majority – against the wishes of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – only makes a half-baked proposal worse still. There is not the slightest chance that unanimity will be achieved in the Council of Ministers. That is why we need to be honest here in the European Parliament and say that we reject the report. We need to throw out this proposal. It is half-baked, unusable, and there are better ways of saving the world than through tax legislation. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Mr Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, once again, the Heads of State or Government are meeting to discuss growth, employment and competitiveness and to exchange papers on these subjects without actually taking any action. I can remember papers on the topic of youth unemployment at the end of the 1990s which identified that some Member States had lower levels of youth unemployment and others had higher levels, and which explained that it would be a good idea to look at what those countries with low rates were doing. Fourteen years have now passed and nothing has happened. When people say that we need to show solidarity, I would like to remind them that in the last 31 years, Greece has received more than EUR 100 billion from the Structural Funds. That is an expression of European solidarity. It has repeatedly been said that the money can be used, for example, to fund education and training, in particular for young people. I can remember initiatives in the region which I come from that involved attempts to introduce the dual educational system in different areas of Greece. However, this did not work. The energy revolution is still in progress in Greece and this and many other things could be financed using money from the Structural Funds. This demonstrates Europe’s solidarity. However, we also need to increase the pressure to ensure that the funds made available by the European Union are used for the purposes which will be discussed during the spring summit. Otherwise, this will once again be a summit with lots of interesting papers but no concrete results. Markus Ferber  (PPE
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Ferreira, I specifically referred to the European Union Structural Funds. However, I would like to ask for understanding on this point. If this funding had been spent in the same way as the Federal Republic of Germany used the money from the Marshall Plan, you would not need a rescue package today. Markus Ferber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to be a little bit more honest again in this debate. What was the situation like before the euro was introduced? What were the interest rates like in Greece when it still had the drachma? What were the rates in Italy when it had the lira, or in Spain with the peseta and Portugal with the escudo? They were considerably higher than what has to be paid on the financial markets at the moment. Those Member States within the euro enjoyed the sweet poison of low interest rates for a decade, and pursued a spending policy that they are no longer on top of. For them to now say that they want to continue to enjoy that sweet poison via the introduction of Eurobonds is precisely the wrong reaction to have. Many mistakes were made here in the past that now need to be corrected. Anyone who believes that this problem would be solved by making the drug that is low interest rates available on a sustained basis would be taking away the pressure that, thank goodness, is currently being applied to a number of Member States by the financial markets. As a second issue, I would point out that Europe would not be made healthy where the result of Eurobonds would be not to make the sick healthy, but to make the healthy sick. That is why we need to be honest on this issue, too. Eurobonds would not strengthen the European Union, they would weaken it. Then we have the craziest proposal of all in this resolution, namely to engineer a kind of self-funding reduction of debts through new debts via a redemption fund. What world are we living in? In real terms, what that means is that the debts that countries have run up would be refinanced thanks to the creditworthiness of others, with the costs being borne by those who kept their finances in order in that they have to pay higher interest rates for those who failed to do likewise. That is the communitarisation of debts. Anyone introducing this as a policy instrument endangers Europe much, much more than what we have currently put in place in connection with the rescue packages. I can therefore but warn against acting as if Eurobonds would enable us to solve all our problems. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Markus Ferber  (PPE

 Ms Goulard, I will just say, briefly, that that is not a judgment that I have put forward here. I would just point out that the last government bonds issued by Italy before it joined the euro bore an interest rate of 10%. There was no outcry in Italy at the time. Nobody said that other countries should take on the debt. It was natural for Italy to pay high interest rates. Yet now, all of a sudden, because we have had low interest rates for 10 years and got up to our ears in debt, because money was cheap – for investments just as for the public purse – we want to prolong that through Eurobonds. That represents a trap from which we will not escape, and I stand by what I said. Markus Ferber,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to join in thanking our rapporteur and all those who worked on the report because this is certainly not a routine task, even if this is the fortieth time we have dealt with competition policy on the basis of a report from the Commission. I would like to thank the Commissioner for his very comprehensive presentation – 2010 was, of course, the first year in which you had full responsibility for competition policy. Turning to something you mentioned yourself, I would like to ask that some practices in the area of public aid in the banking sector should be eradicated because the new stress tests required by the European banking supervision system indicate a need for further recapitalisation for the banks. I do not believe that it will contribute anything to the stability of the banking system if we still have a large number of unresolved or outstanding old cases on the one hand, while new cases are being created on the other because pressure is increasing to raise the equity capital quota accordingly, particularly in the area of private banks. Hence my urgent plea to you, Commissioner, to find a swift solution that will help stabilise the banking sector so that it can withstand the challenges of the international environment. The second major issue, the control of mergers, will continue to concern us increasingly in the years ahead. Here, too, I can only urge you to continue on the clear and transparent path taken by the Commission to date within the framework of merger control. It is in the interests of all involved, particularly the consumer, that we should ensure that competition is possible in the area of merger control, whether in larger or other structures, which is not for me to judge. With this in mind, I would like to thank all those who have been involved. I hope, Commissioner, that we will find a solution soon, particularly in the banking sector. Markus Ferber  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I can only agree with all of those who have congratulated the Council Presidency. Not only were you an honest broker during a difficult time; you were also a European broker. That was very nice to see during these difficult times in which we are seeing political trends in a number of Member States that suggest to the people that it would be possible to achieve more alone than together. You focused on what unites us. It was also very refreshing to see that, with this clear European agenda, you also received the support of the people in Poland on domestic policy matters. That was not particularly easy in this context. Therefore, I have the highest respect for what you have achieved. In this six-month period, we were also able to get a few things under way in the area of financial market regulation. Allow me to highlight just one area in which I was able to join in the negotiations myself, namely, the question of the regulation of short selling and naked credit default swaps in connection with government bonds, where the Commission did not have the confidence to propose a stringent regulation and with regard to which all the Member States said that we would not succeed, and where, thanks to the Polish Presidency, we did succeed in imposing sanctions against a highly speculative instrument and, where necessary, prohibiting it, so that we could help to bring greater stability to the financial markets. I would particularly like to thank your Finance Minister and the Secretary of State, who got this off the ground during a difficult discussion process between Parliament and the Council. That is an example that shows that we can do something together in the interests of security and stability in Europe. I would like to express my sincere thanks for that. Markus Ferber  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Dowgielewicz, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, we ought to focus once again on our task here today. I have now listened to eight speakers and eight different solutions. That demonstrates the problem that we have here in this House. I am, of course, pleased that there is a more united approach in the Council and that things can be brought together more quickly than the many proposals that we have now heard from the various political groups. If we need to be clear about one thing, however, then it is that we need to make immediate and united efforts to put in order what the Member States have so far prevented us from sorting out. It was easy for the US to establish a European regulation because the country already had institutions at a Federal level. We needed jointly to establish these first, and we have done that together as Parliament, even in the face of opposition, for example, from the United Kingdom. By tightening up the Stability and Growth Pact with the Governance Package, we have shown that we are capable of action here and are able to strengthen Europe to enable it to function. However, Mr Barroso, I also have a very strong point of criticism: we cannot now talk about accelerated procedures if we still have no proposals from the Commission for the majority of the necessary regulations. We are waiting for the regulation of financial markets and the Market Abuse Directive to name but two, which will probably not be tabled until next week. We cannot adopt something that is not even on the table! Therefore, my sincere request is for the Commission to press forward with these matters. All of this was intended to be done in the first half of this year. It is now October! You cannot accuse Parliament of not doing its job. We are genuinely doing everything possible to find appropriate solutions. Therefore, please table the proposals and then we will adopt them. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add my thanks for the clear affirmation you have given to the European project, Mr Tusk. I believe that now, in the 21st century, it makes sense to make a concerted effort to address problems that one country cannot resolve on its own and to find a good solution in the interest of our citizens. Thank you very much for your clear expression of commitment in this area. The tasks facing you in the second half of 2011 are enormous. The key one has already been mentioned, namely, the Greek rescue. I believe that it is right and proper that the European Union should take the lead here, rather than allowing the credit rating agencies to set the pace and direction for our actions. We shall also have to adjust our internal mechanisms if we are to remain capable of action and ensure stability. Unfortunately, Mr Farage has left us, but I would appreciate it if continuous attacks on our common currency from within the European Union would stop, even from those who are not part of the currency union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to answer this question. If we continue with this debate for the next few years, then the Americans will decide on the world’s environmental protection, the Chinese will dictate consumer protection and Europeans will have no protections whatsoever. Our job is to work for the people. (Applause)
 I wanted to briefly point out that we also have a number of problems to resolve in the area of the regulation of the financial markets, both in terms of the governance package and in relation to financial services. I look forward to working with you and hope that we Europeans can play a significant role in stabilising the financial markets. We have a particular duty in this regard and I am optimistic that we will succeed admirably under the Polish Presidency. Markus Ferber,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is right for us to debate this important proposal from the Commission here in plenary today and for us to lay down our position as the European Parliament tomorrow, because discussions in recent weeks – with all respect to the Hungarian Presidency, which has tried very hard to bring the Council and Parliament closer together on this – have shown that the Council of Ministers still needs to be motivated into adopting rules that allow what is necessary, but which prohibit what is not necessary. Let me say quite plainly that I can hardly stand to hear the word liquidity any more. If there was one problem that was to blame for leading us into the financial crisis, it was that there was too much liquidity that was invested in products that nobody needs and which then collapsed and took us into the crisis. I ask you therefore: who is it that needs insurance against a government defaulting on its commitments? Only those that hold such government securities, and they should indeed have it. Anyone speculating on a country being unable to meet its commitments, however, should not be able to use such instruments to do so. That is why these products must be prohibited. When it comes to the short selling of shares – in other words, selling shares that one does not have – it is a matter of drawing up rules that prevent highly speculative behaviour. I believe we have achieved a reasonable compromise here, and in this respect discussions with the Council have been very constructive. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding work. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive discussions, and also the Commission, which has played a very positive part in achieving this. Moreover, I hope that, for its part, the Council – which is unfortunately not represented here today – will be able to agree a sensible resolution of this matter with us as soon as possible. With that in mind, I am pleased that we – as Parliament – are now sending out a clear signal as regards this important dossier. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is actually about innovative financing, but we have already heard something about that. Innovation does not simply mean inventing new taxes or re-labelling what has always been there, such as national debt. I would like to concentrate very briefly on what this debate is really about. It is not about the introduction of Eurobonds – and the CDU/CSU parties will certainly speak out against that – but rather it is about learning the lessons of the crisis in the financial markets, and that means quite simply that speculation must be taxed too. It also means – and I will state this quite clearly – that if this cannot be done worldwide at the G20, then we must do it at European Union level. There is no alternative; that is why I am not simply looking for applause now, Mr Bullmann, but for a clear, strong vote by the European Parliament tomorrow. In this, Commissioner, the Commission must act as our ally against the Member States – particularly against the Member State that we have just heard speaking so loudly about what the City of London thinks. I will simply say to you, Mr Farage: look at the unemployment figures and look at the economic decline of your country, which has concentrated on financial market products. If you still built cars – as we do in Bavaria and in Germany – then you would be doing somewhat better now. That is why the financial transaction tax must be called for and introduced now as a matter of urgency. It is our duty as Europeans. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).

 Madam President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that today is a good day, not only for the European institutions, but also for the people of Europe, because we have succeeded, two years after the collapse of the Lehman bank, in creating a structure that, although not eliminating all of the problems that could arise in the financial market, will help to make the excesses that have occurred in the financial market no longer possible in the European Union. We can be proud of ourselves for this. I would like to express my thanks to the Belgian Presidency, because we had the feeling – and I can endorse what Mrs Goulard said – that the Council was not making much of an effort in this regard at the beginning. Although the Council adopted a unanimous resolution at first, it did not solve the problems. It was thanks to the European Parliament that a solution was found across the group divides which is truly viable and which will ensure that we have stable supervisory structures as well as a range of instruments that can be used in crisis situations to stem excesses and thus help to stabilise the financial sector. I would like to thank you most sincerely, Mr Reynders, as you have personally shown a great deal of commitment to this matter. However, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the Commission, which ensured that, in a fair dialogue, the two positions represented by the Council and Parliament, which were very far apart to start with, could be brought together. Thank you very much. That gives us hope with regard to further legislation. Markus Ferber,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the second and third Postal Services Directive, I am, of course, particularly pleased that this subject is also on the agenda during this parliamentary term, because I believe it is also important to show what we have achieved since we tabled the Green Paper in 1992, as the Commissioner mentioned. We have managed to significantly improve the quality of postal services throughout Europe. I can still remember that, two parliamentary terms ago, I said in this Chamber that it was usual for holidaymakers to arrive home before the postcards they had sent home to their loved ones. That situation has now changed. We have achieved a significant improvement in the quality of cross-border postal services. We have achieved a significant improvement in the quality of postal services within the Member States. With the obligation for a universal service that is uniform throughout Europe, we have also managed to significantly improve the availability of postal services, or in areas where it was already good, we were able to maintain this level. That is also important, and it was mentioned by both the Commissioner and our committee chair. Of course, in implementing the third directive, which for the majority of Member States specifies 1 January 2011 as the date for complete liberalisation, it is now important to safeguard this universal service on a permanent basis. I would like to emphasise what is stated in the question regarding the simultaneous requirement – and that was the Conditio sine qua non
 for the third directive – that it should not result in a deterioration in working conditions, but that existing social standards and protection mechanisms should continue to apply in the Member States beyond 1 January 2011. We will, of course, ensure that this is the case. We will not only have the oral question today, but the Commission also has obligations to provide us with reports. We will read these reports very carefully, Commissioner, and if necessary we will also formulate the appropriate conclusions. Markus Ferber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, one could wonder what we have actually now achieved after a year spent in discussions, debates and many sessions in the trialogue, and I could have certainly imagined doing something nicer than spending my time there. One year on from the European elections, when we announced in public how we wanted to bring the finance markets into line, we are now at a point where our success rate ranges from very little to none at all. The problem has already been explained. We are dealing with markets which operate globally nowadays. Member States still believe that they can use their national supervisory structures to apply rules in this environment. The fact that this did not work was not what actually triggered the financial crisis, but it contributed to Europe being affected by it as well. This is why I would ask when this realisation, which is often mentioned in grandiose speeches, will be converted into political action, where it is suddenly about protecting stock exchange centres and banking structures and no longer about protecting citizens. This is the task to which we have committed ourselves as the European Parliament. I hope that Member States will commit themselves to this task, too, because we share the responsibility for implementing proper supervision regulations for citizens, which will ensure that individuals’ savings are also permanently secure. I would of course hope – and I am now addressing the Commissioners – that every effort will now be made by the Commission so that we can achieve a good outcome as quickly as possible, for the benefit of people living in Europe. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).  
– (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is this all about then? The question is quite simply how can the financial markets help to reduce the costs that they have incurred for states, societies and the economy? That is the crucial question that we must answer. I think that together, we have developed a very balanced text. I am also very grateful to the Commissioner for the way he has worded it. On the one hand, we cannot pretend that Europe is the Island of the Blessed where we can do what we like without the global financial markets reacting to it. Things must be coordinated internationally. On the other hand, we must also ensure that the sector makes an appropriate contribution to overcoming the crisis. That is why I would caution that we must stop coming up with a new item every week that we can use to solve all the problems of the world. A couple of months ago, it was an additional levy on airline tickets that was going to solve all our problems, now it is the tax on financial transactions and next month, somebody will think of something else. That is going too far. It is a question of involving the financial markets in an internationally coordinated manner. If a sensible solution to this can be put forward by the Commission and introduced into international negotiations, then we will be on the right track. We should also be honest with ourselves. Those who maintain that we can stop speculation with such instruments are clearly deluding themselves. What we want is for speculators to make their contribution to the risk and to overcoming the risk. That is the right approach. In doing so, you have our full support Commissioner. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to begin with, it is right that common procedures should go with a common currency. It is right to consider how these common procedures, which have not yet been implemented everywhere in the Single Euro Payments Area, might be enforced a little better. On the other hand, I will say quite clearly that we still have to adapt the rulebook in a few places. I myself come from a country where the direct debit procedure is a very widespread procedure, in order to facilitate the processing of certain regular payments. The procedure that is currently planned in the rulebook is a very bureaucratic, very complicated procedure and therefore, I would be very pleased, Commissioner, if, with regard to a final date – something we all want – this area in particular is tackled once again. On the one hand, there should be no vulnerability to fraud – that is a problem in the cross-border area – but on the other hand, it should also be possible for local charges to be debited, and for any magazine subscription, any insurance premium, any mobile phone bill, and so on to continue to be collected in a simple procedure by the companies concerned. That is my request and there is also a corresponding passage in our motion for a resolution on this subject, so that we can contribute to ensuring that procedures that have proved successful in the Member States can also be guaranteed after the final introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area.

 Madam President, Commission President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, what is tomorrow’s vote all about? It is about doing what many people in this House cannot do and others do not want to do. It is, in fact, about taking responsibility for Europe. I would like to highlight one point. Mr Barroso, I am very grateful to you for mentioning this again in your interruption. It is about taking responsibility for Europe’s ability to act during a difficult time, in order to overcome all the problems which have been the subject of justified criticism from citizens and also from this Parliament. I believe that today’s debate has helped to clarify the issue of whom Europe can and cannot rely on in future when it comes to taking political responsibility in the years to come. However, I would like to point out, Mr Barroso, that there is, of course, a whole series of subjects on the agenda which need to be dealt with and you have a great deal of responsibility in this area because you have a monopoly on launching initiatives at a European level. I would like to look at one more subject which seems to me not to have been covered in sufficient detail in the debate so far and that is agricultural policy. In this area, we are faced with several new challenges. It is not enough simply to mention the fact that the agriculture ministers came to a resolution in the autumn of last year. It is not enough that we have begun a programme of comprehensive agricultural reform, because when the basic conditions change, you must, of course, take a corresponding initiative to help farmers in the European Union. My request is that you take the Commissioner for Agriculture on one side and point out to her that her model will not succeed in guiding this important sector out of the crisis. We are prepared, and I am speaking on behalf of my colleagues here, to take over responsibility for Europe in the interests of the European Union and the people of Europe. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Along with a large majority in Parliament, I have voted against the ACTA. Today it is a case of ACTA ad acta
. Tomorrow it will be a new start for increased market protection. In its current form, the ACTA was beset with too many errors and a lack of clarity. It confused people and resulted in a large amount of public pressure in the social networks and new media, the latter being something positive. I also still find it annoying that for years the ACTA was kept secret and was only made public at a late stage following intensive pressure from the European Parliament. We MEPs were expected to rubber stamp everything in a fast-track procedure. That is not acceptable. Many mistakes were made that we can only correct by making a completely new start. The clear ‘no’ to ACTA is, for me, an unqualified ‘yes’ to global protection against ‘commercial-scale counterfeiting and piracy’, which is actually the key concern of the agreement. Without effective, global coordination of copyright protection, Europe has a great deal to lose. Intellectual property is Europe’s most valuable raw material. Our decision today clears the way for the development of a new, better and transparent agreement under European leadership. This process can and must take place in dialogue with all ‘stakeholders’ – with the focus on people and ethics. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, there is a German rhyme: Ein kleines Dorf im Frankenland ist durch sein gutes Bier bekannt
, which tells of regional pride in a brewery, and this demonstrates a problem that we have created today. If this brewery or its distributor is 107 kilometres away from where I live, then in future, it will no longer be able to supply me with its products unless it buys a new tachograph and complies with new red tape. That is why I voted against this resolution today, because in my view, we should not be overburdening our small and medium-sized enterprises. There are many points that we have managed to incorporate which were positive. After all, it was planned that a radius of just 50 kilometres should be accepted for regional suppliers. The Commission was being quite absurd there. A distance of 100 kilometres may be just about feasible. However, what if the distance is more than this? I therefore consider it to be excessive. One final aspect: as a representative of an employees’ organisation in the German CSU party, I would also say that this regulation represents complete control of workers. Why? It is because the entire working day of those distributing construction materials or drinks from the breweries is completely controlled via GPS. For data protection reasons, too, therefore, I feel that what we have decided today is highly questionable, and I emphasise once again why I voted against it. Martin Kastler  (PPE

Madam President, I voted against the Ferreira report for a number of reasons. Reading our newspapers in Germany – only today, one of the big dailies says that the German chancellor is asking whether anybody still sticks to the rules in Europe, or they say that Cyprus is the next candidate for a bailout – I ask myself: ‘What next?’. Just as the previous speaker said that after the ‘six-pack’ comes the ‘two-pack’, I believe that after the ‘two-pack’ will come the ‘zero-pack’, because we no longer know how it is actually supposed to work. I am very concerned that we, the elected representatives, will be the last to find out the secret plan that the European Commission and the institutions have for how we carry on with Europe. I am firmly convinced that in the future, we will have to consider how we carry on at all. The mood among the population of my constituency is so bad that it is clear: we want to help, but we also want to have rules, and those rules should be adhered to and checked. I cannot therefore vote for further debt, for a Europe of debt, a transfer union, which is what we already have in many areas. I am against eurobonds. I am also against project bonds, because I do not think that they will help us to act usefully in this area in the future and make progress together. I hope, however, that at some point, the European institutions will tell us transparently and openly about this so-called secret plan, so that we find out what it involves. Martin Kastler,

 Mr President, Mr De Gucht, your statement was very informative. Thank you very much. Sometimes, figures say more than words. Up to this point, as you have mentioned, the European Patent Office has granted almost 2 000 patents for plants and almost 1 200 patents for animals created with and without the use of genetic engineering. I would like to mention two prominent examples. The first is the approval of patents on barley which has been genetically modified and modified by breeding. This applies to the entire chain from the seed through to the plant and, therefore, affects both our farmers and our brewers, both producers and consumers. This example shows the devastating scope of the patenting processes. The second example concerns the so-called long-life tomato, which is not to be confused with the long-life oil in the engines of your diesel cars. The ploy used by the applicant, the US company Arcadia, enabled it to obtain a patent by circumventing current EU regulations. It was not the tomato that was patented, but its genetic material, in this case, selected enzymes. This shows the lengths that companies will go to, despite the fact that, as you have said, Mr De Gucht, Article 4 of the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions of 1998 clearly states: The following shall not be patentable: (a) plant and animal varieties; (b) essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals. We are of the opinion that this definition should be made more precise. Technical processes used to support conventional breeding activities must not lead to patentability. We would like to make it quite clear that there must be no patents on life. We need to send out a clear signal that there needs to be a more ethical approach and greater honesty with regard to creation. I repeat: we are opposed to the patentability of life throughout Europe. Therefore, Mr De Gucht, we are calling for a clear statement from the Commission that patents on genetic material and genetic resources are, and will remain, banned. Secondly, we are calling for a clear position on Article 4 of the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions: no patents on life. Thirdly, Mr De Gucht, on behalf of many farmers and breeders in Europe, we are calling for the breeders’ and farmers’ privilege to be clearly enshrined in all legislation. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Today, I have voted in favour of the resolution on the Statute for a European cooperative society with regard to the involvement of employees. It is good that we are focusing specifically on the subject of cooperatives in the European Parliament, as this is the International Year of Cooperatives. In the European Union, there are around 160 000 cooperatives, which are owned by more than a quarter of all Europeans and employ about 5.4 million people. In my home region of Bavaria alone, there are over 1 200 cooperatives and cooperative enterprises with more than 2.7 million members. Cooperatives are one of the cornerstones of our economy. Their achievements are even more obvious in times of crisis, because cooperatives involve taking joint responsibility. For example, during the financial crisis, cooperative banks demonstrated how sustainable and resilient they are as a result of their cooperative business model. They have not lost billions in the crisis like other banks. On the contrary, their balance sheets show an increase in revenue and growth. They provide 5.4 million high-quality, crisis-proof jobs throughout Europe. Cooperatives have their roots in the regions where they are located. They represent a model for the future, for our regions and for Europe. If we promote the cooperative model as part of EU development policy, we can make a contribution which will really help people, actively involve them and encourage them to be independent. We need more incentives for cooperatives. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I can only support what my colleague, Mr Posselt, has already said: Strasbourg is the capital of Europe, the seat of the European Parliament. I propose that we should close Brussels, that we stop shuttling back and forth between Brussels and Strasbourg, and that we finally invest here. We own the buildings here, but not the ones in Brussels. This is the seat of Parliament. I have to ask myself: we entertain so many visitors here in Strasbourg every month. We explain how Europe works to them. Why are we building a Parliamentarium, a museum of European history, in Brussels? That belongs here in Strasbourg. It is for this reason that I voted against this report. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I have voted against the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the feasibility of introducing stability bonds. The name has been changed, but the content remains the same. These are Eurobonds. We have now reached a stage in Europe where we need to ask ourselves the fundamental question of how Europe is to go forward. The Italian Prime Minister, Mr Monti, said today in a guest article in Germany that we need to ‘rethink democracy’. To this, I would add that we must ‘rethink Europe’. We must do this if we want to carry the citizens of Europe along with us. I believe that referendums are an important instrument. We need citizens to become increasingly involved in Europe, not only in the Member States, but also at a European level. This will enable us to discuss the major issues currently facing us which have led us into this crisis. It will take us further forward than simply tabling new motions for resolutions to distribute ever larger debts among ourselves. Every country is responsible for its own debts. We should not be transferring debts from one state to another. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me preface my remarks by saying that I am also greatly in favour of freedom of movement and I believe that it is a really important achievement for the European Union that we can move around this single market freely in the service sectors, indeed in all sectors. However, there is also a principle that applies not just within the European Union, but also under the rule of law, namely: pacta sunt servanda
 – treaties are to be honoured. According to the Treaty, a clause applies to the free movement of workers, setting down a period of three years, plus two years, plus two years. Accordingly, I was unable to support this resolution today, as it is just a symbol of a willingness to alter treaties while they are still in force. In my opinion, it should be up to the Member States themselves to decide. This is what it says in the Treaties. That was correct. Nonetheless, when the Treaties lapse and all restrictions run out, there will be no wave of mass migration to the old Member States from the other Member States. I am absolutely convinced that it is by working together that we will achieve progress in the European Union and that no more barriers should be imposed. Martin Kastler  (PPE

Madam President, I was happy to vote in favour of the report on the mid-term review of the strategy of the European Union for occupational health and safety today. I would like to emphasise three points that I consider particularly important. The first is paragraph 82, which we approved today. I would have preferred it if we had given an even clearer signal in regard to work-life balance, everything relating to occupational health and how we regulate work, the rhythm we provide workers with, including, above all, the protection of Sundays as a day of rest. I myself have launched an initiative in this regard and I believe we can all play our part in supporting March 3 next year as a Europe-wide day for Sunday as a day of rest. I also believe paragraph 16 is particularly important. After all, burnout is one of the illnesses that generates the highest costs in Europe. We urgently need a burnout strategy, and next year the European Commission is to publish a relevant study, as well as holding out the prospect of a Green Paper. This is something we urgently need to discuss in Europe. Finally, as the rapporteur for the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations 2012, I would like to make the following call: let us work together in Europe to ensure we respect everyone, both workers and employers alike, in health, vitality and dignity. Martin Kastler  (PPE

I voted against this report today. No one could disagree with the common objective of the EU Member States of halving the number of road traffic fatalities. Almost 100 people are still dying on Europe’s roads every day. The goal is clear – the question is how to get there. Transport policy is, and remains, a national, regional and partly local issue. Successes are only achieved if they are closely based on the reality of people’s lives. Europe is not the right arena for this. Even if all the proposals were scientifically based, this is still not a matter for the EU. The best example of this is the scientifically-based proposal that, in future, children under three years of age should only travel in secure, rear-facing car seats. As a young father, I am well aware that no child aged two or three will want to sit facing backwards on the rear seat. What is more, drivers can no longer see their children, so who knows what might happen. This own-initiative report is superfluous. Signals like this are counter-productive, particularly in the current climate of crisis. We must concentrate on essentials. Martin Kastler,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, next year will be the first year in which there will be more retired people than workers in Europe. This is a major turning point in Europe. It is a good sign that we are today voting to make the year 2012 the European Year for Active Ageing and for solidarity between generations, and we will also duly celebrate it and present it to the public. At this point, I would like to thank the Commission, the Council and the shadow rapporteurs most sincerely for the fact that we were able to reach a compromise together at first reading, and this is the compromise that we are presenting here today and will jointly adopt. I would like to refer you to an amendment that I would ask you to support. A European Year also requires a certain amount of publicity and for that we also need money. We have fought for a budget line for this so that a certain amount is available in order to present to the public the subject of solidarity between generations as well as the subject of active ageing. Thank you very much and I would ask for your support. (Applause) Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have voted today on the report by Mr Goerens and I believe that this report is moving in the right direction. For the first time in the history of the European Union, we have done away with the unquestioning belief in budget support in the field of development aid. This means that for the first time we have stated in a report that we should not simply give money to administrative bodies, to states or to governments without sanctions and without criteria that can be monitored. This is the right way forward. However, in my opinion one thing is missing. This concerns an amendment which I have tabled and which was unfortunately voted down. The amendment stated that we in the European Union must impose sanctions when a state can be proved to have disregarded the criteria which form the basis for the provision of development aid. We must change this situation so that we can maintain our credibility and make it clear to our voters and our taxpayers what we are spending development aid on. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the few of you who are still here, visitors to the European Parliament, in conclusion, I would like to make some brief remarks on the subject of misleading directory companies. I have voted in favour of the resolution because it is important for us in the European Union to make our opinion clear on this. This is a part of organised crime in Europe which involves bogus companies taking money from people and from small and medium-sized businesses over the Internet. We must make every effort to prevent this from happening. The Commission has made many soapbox speeches calling for genuine support to be given to small and medium-sized companies and for the amount of red tape to be reduced. One important aspect of this is to bring an end to this type of organised crime. The resolution represents a step in the right direction, but only a small one. We must take action and, therefore, I am calling on everyone to continue with this work, not only those Members who are not here, but all of us who represent the citizens of Europe in Parliament.

 I voted in favour of this report as I believe that businesses have a social responsibility – towards their employees and customers, the environment and society at large. A new term has been added to the German dictionary: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). This is – and should remain – a voluntary matter. In our globalised markets, CSR entails much more than making a donation to the local football club. Businesses that operate in a globally responsible way help shape foreign policy and development policy. They are Europe’s ambassadors to the world, flying the flag for Europe’s social standards worldwide. We should support CSR, not regulate it. In this case, Europe’s role should be that of a moderator, not a regulator. This principle must be applied if the European Commission is to get serious and take up the topic of CSR once again: we do not need excessive regulation. We have underlined this position with this report. Martin Kastler  (PPE

Madam President, I also voted in favour of this report and of this resolution – in favour of Macedonia. However, if we are being honest about this, then there is one detail that must be mentioned. We cannot tell people and ethnic groups in other countries to rename their language because other countries do not like what they call it. That is laid down in international law, and as Europeans we must be sure that we remain honest about this. I was consequently very annoyed that unfortunately, one amendment was passed that I voted against, which stated that Macedonian should not be allowed to be called Macedonian. Macedonia is a country with great prospects in Europe mainly because it also has great economic prospects in the Balkans, a region that has genuine difficulties, is prospering economically, and is conducting the negotiations with élan – which is very positive. In view of this positive attitude, I would like to thank all the Members who voted for this resolution, as well as all those who worked with the parliament there as part of the European Parliament delegation. We should make these prospects clear to the people there who want to be part of Europe. Let us work together to that end. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I have voted in favour of the Oomen-Ruijten report and would like to emphasise two points. Firstly, when we see that in some countries in Europe too many pensions are being paid out too early, but these countries are getting into difficulties and the others are having to bail them out, that is unfair. This unfairness cannot, of course, be refinanced via the EU. We need European coordination in this regard. The second point that I am very pleased with in this report is the fact that it makes it very clear, according to the principle of subsidiarity, that the Member States themselves are responsible for pension provision. That is indeed the case. I therefore consider this report to be a step in the right direction in that, on the one hand, we in Europe are recognising that our citizens want more coordination in the social sphere because they feel unfairly treated and, on the other, we are making it clear where the main responsibility lies, namely with the Member States. This report represents a step in this direction. We will do everything possible to ensure that the White Paper continues to push ahead with this. Martin Kastler  (PPE
),

 It is shocking that Christians throughout the world continue to be persecuted and murdered. It is an indictment of Europe that the foreign ministers of the Member States in the Council cannot manage to respond to this. They treat the will of Parliament with contempt. The EU must do something. I call on the Council to show responsibility for the basic right of freedom of religion, to swiftly draw up an implementable strategy to protect Christians throughout the world and to establish a separate unit for intercultural and religious matters in the European External Action Service. These things need to be done now, not some time in the future. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Today’s vote on the European citizens’ initiative is a milestone for more democracy in Europe. I welcome the compromise and I will support it, because the report produced by Mr Lamassoure and Mrs Gurmai is the first step in the right direction. Ladies and gentlemen, we must not be afraid of citizens having more opportunities to express their will. We must give the citizens of Europe more codecision rights, not just every five years at the European elections. This needs courage, stamina and strength. Courage to keep returning to the dialogue. Stamina, because decisions cannot necessarily be made more quickly and strength because our representative democracy includes, at last, in my opinion, more participative elements. Our goal must be to increase the dialogue in Europe between the citizens and the politicians. I am pleased that we are moving one step closer to the Europe of the citizens today with the European citizens’ initiative. I am convinced that one day we Europeans will take joint European decisions, in the form of citizens’ decisions. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 I have voted in favour of the amendments and against the Berlinguer report, because I am not sure that it provides adequate support for subsidiarity. I do not believe that we should be able to delete important details just because this is a large package of directives. This is a strategy which will backfire. For me, the crux of the matter is paragraph 40, which, in the form that it was adopted today, together with other components of the Stockholm Programme, will provoke conflicts of jurisdiction. In specific terms, there are doubts as to whether we should use family law for the mutual recognition of civil status documents, in other words, marriage certificates, and, therefore, whether we should take into account the decision-making authority of the Member States with regard to the definition of marriage, following the procedure outlined in Article 81(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. While this remains unclear, there is a risk of a conflict between the simple procedures of civil law and the complex procedures of cross-border family law. A sentence corresponding with Amendment 3 would have been sufficient to defuse this conflict. This is a detail which, unfortunately, was not supported by the majority in Parliament today. I remain of the opinion that marriage and family life are under the specific protection of the state. They are exclusively a matter for the Member States. Therefore, I have voted against this own-initiative report. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I would like to respond briefly to what Mr Hannan has just said. It is, of course, essential for this Parliament to have a seat, but the seat is established by our treaties and it is here in Strasbourg. You are right to say that we need to save taxpayers’ money and that we must work towards being based in one place. However, the refuge of parliamentarianism, Mr Hannan, is here in Strasbourg. This is where we as Members of Parliament and representatives of the people can work together. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, the Estrela report yesterday covered a very important topic. I would like to say at this point that it was rather difficult for me to vote in favour of it. As a young father, I was present at the birth of both my children and I have to say that I do not know why I would have needed a holiday then, because I did not give birth, my wife did. This is all about maternity leave and we have included fathers. It is difficult point. Nevertheless, it is important for young women to have the opportunity to have a child and then to return to their professional life. I believe that this will be possible under the new system. Although I would personally have preferred 18 weeks, I did eventually vote in favour of 20 weeks in the final vote. We must now ask ourselves whether this will bring more justice and more children in Europe. Family policy in Europe is an issue for the future. I hope that we are sending out a signal that we have taken action in this area. Now we just have to hope that the Member States take corresponding measures. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, incarcerating people in labour camps because they do not share the same views as a governing regime is a crime against human dignity. Slave labour camps, re-education camps and internment camps – these are all anachronisms that have lost none of their repugnance in the 21st century, wherever in the world they may be. I am truly disappointed that the European Commission, against our better judgment, has failed to present any concrete measures to the Members of this House to deal with the Chinese case and has not explained how it envisages future cooperation between the EU and China. If the US has lists of businesses and if books exist publishing the names of businesses that are known to be a front for internment camps, then why is it that you do not have them? Why are you taking this blinkered approach? You and the Commission are making yourselves share in the blame for the misery suffered by those who have been imprisoned, mostly without due legal process. No one could want this. The rule of law is one of our fundamental principles in Europe and in the European Union. As an MEP, I am ashamed to have had to listen to what was said here today. Nonetheless, I am pleased, on the other hand, that we have drawn attention here to this principle of the rule of law for liberty and for human dignity on a cross-party basis. I would like to thank the House for this. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are taking a new and important step forward in the field of animal welfare by providing more protection for animals used in scientific research. We have heard a great deal about animal welfare. We have also heard that Europe is an important location for industrial research and innovation. However, there is one issue which we have not talked about enough. This concerns a fundamental value of the European Union, namely human dignity, and the question of how we handle it. I believe that we must not, on the one hand, improve animal welfare and, on the other, expose ourselves to risks in an area which, at least in part, runs counter to our European values. Why am I saying this? The European Commission has referred to alternative methods in its documents. These include five methods relating to research into and use of embryonic stem cells and, in particular, human stem cells. In my opinion, this is immoral. It is something which I cannot ignore when it comes to voting today on the proposed compromise between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Therefore, I would like to call on you and, in particular, on the Council, the Member States and the Commission, in the form of the so-called Regulatory Committee, to take a highly sensitive approach. When we show concern for human dignity, this does not mean that we are opposed to animal welfare. On the contrary, we want both of these things. We want to cooperate to protect the dignity of living creatures, whether they are animals or humans, in a way that corresponds to our European concept of dignity, so that we can work together to defend and support it. One of Europe’s trademarks is that we are prepared to fight for human freedom and dignity. For this reason, I will not be able to take part in today’s vote, because in moral terms, it is not possible for me to do one thing and ignore another. Discussing this subject today was the right thing to do, but the third dimension of human dignity has come off rather badly. Martin Kastler  (PPE

I welcome the report on the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States prepared by Mr Őry. Why is that? In this report, the European Parliament has made it very clear what we Europeans can expect in the coming years in the area of work and employment. In addition to the questions of migration and demographic change, the potential for employment in Europe in the area of the so-called ‘green economy’ is a very important issue. This potential can only be exploited successfully if there are sufficient qualified jobs available. This offers a unique opportunity for women at management level in particular. Both men and women have equal opportunities in this dynamic and still relatively new area of business, something that is sometimes more difficult in other areas. It is necessary to ensure that it is possible to balance work and family life, for example, by creating family-friendly jobs and by providing childcare facilities. It must be possible to establish individual models for working hours, as well as part-time arrangements, particularly for those in management positions. Unfortunately, this is not yet possible in all parts of Europe’s labour market. Martin Kastler,

 Mr President, in 2007 and 2008, Libya voted against the United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for a moratorium on executions, and the repeated questioning by human rights organisations elicited no official statements either. It is therefore very important to us that the names of the people who have been executed are now officially revealed at last. Any execution is one too many. We condemn the use of executions and the death penalty. They are inhumane and cruel, and any execution is one too many. In our resolution, therefore, we clearly ask that we change this situation and bring it to light and that we now work together to bring about a change here. No more underreporting. Instead we want transparent information on what happens here and a humane penalty for genuine criminals, but no excessive punishment for those who criticise the regime in Tripoli.

Madam President, around 75% to 80% of all those suffering religious persecution worldwide are Christians. We in the European Parliament are fighting specifically for human rights throughout the world. For me, religious freedom is a central concept of our human rights policy. Therefore, I regret that those on the left and the liberal left in the European Parliament often join together to keep silent about the fate of Christians. At the same time, I am pleased that we are jointly tabling a resolution today about the dreadful situation in Pakistan. Of the 156 million people in Pakistan, 95% are Muslims, around 3% Christians and around 2% Hindus. As a Christian, I would like to focus once again on the situation of the Pakistani Christians, who are subjected to severe persecution. Anyone who allows violent attacks on Christians to take place must receive a response from the civilised world. Therefore, the EU should introduce a criterion in its development policy and economic cooperation which covers this issue and allows sanctions to be applied if necessary. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I have voted in favour of this report and I would like to congratulate Mr Mikolášik on the excellent work he has done. I believe that today is an important day, because we have ensured that donors and recipients of organs will have consistent standards and greater safety.

 Mr President, the citizens of Europe are right. They like honest foods and they like honest politicians. I respect public opinion of this kind. We cannot simply ignore public opinion and we cannot simply dismiss it as populism. That is not the case. We must take notice of what our citizens are saying to us. If our constituents and our citizens are of the opinion that real meat must be real meat and that it must not be made of pieces of meat glued together, then we must make sure that it is not possible for meat to be processed in this way. This is why I have voted against allowing thrombin to be used as a food glue. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted against this report for two reasons. Firstly, I am disturbed that Europe is increasingly taking a scatter-gun approach to development policy and that more and more resolutions and requests are encouraging this approach. Secondly, I have voted against the report, because I believe it is a bad thing for us to try to impose family planning policy on developing and emerging countries in the form of a sort of cultural imperialism. Abortion is not a solution and I regret the fact that some Members of the European Parliament refer euphemistically to ‘reproductive medicine’ when they mean abortion. This does not change the fact that abortion means killing an unborn child. Therefore, I have voted against this report and I hope that in future, we will not use the same euphemistic terms in every resolution and own-initiative report to describe aspects of cultural imperialism.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of those people who has brought one of the first citizens’ initiative petitions into being, specifically, on the subject of protecting Sundays. Today, we have the pleasure of debating – and then deciding upon – a potential way of involving the citizens in the process of Europe’s political work. That means that this is a potential way to bring about more democracy and to counter Europe-fatigue. That said, I am not here just to give praise. Rather, I have two requests to make of you, when you now take this Regulation into its final phase. Firstly, we Europeans are technologically advanced people. I would like to ask you to make the Internet the definitive medium so that a citizens’ initiative with a million signatures is also admissible with electronic signatures, which are also legally binding. Secondly, I would like to point out that what we are doing here is just a first step. I would like to go a step further. We now have a right of initiative for the citizens. It would be my wish, however, for us to also have referendums, as we have in my home region of Bavaria, at the European level in future. What happens is that there is a petition for a referendum, then, when enough people have put their name to it, there is the possibility of a referendum. It would be my wish that we should also have this in Europe. Martin Kastler,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is regrettable that a number of States around the world still, in this day and age, conduct or permit this inhumane kind of punishment for serious criminals. I believe that nobody has the right to decide about the life or death of another person, be it at the beginning or the end of that life, and certainly not in connection with punishing a criminal act. This barbaric punishment by execution has no place in the modern world. The unforgettable, great Pope John Paul II pointed out that, above all, atonement, the chance for reconciliation, must be possible. With an irreversible act such as the death penalty, that is not possible. That is why, as parliamentary groups, we are joining forces to call on our colleagues in South Korea to take up this subject in their parliament and to join with us Europeans to campaign for the abolition of the death penalty, as a mark of humanity. I would like to call on all Members to support this joint motion for a resolution unanimously. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say on behalf of part of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and, above all, on behalf of my colleague, Elmar Brok, that we are shocked that the House has today rejected the amendment which would have included Christians and other religious minorities in this report. I think it is truly outrageous that, although we are constantly making statements on human rights issues, we do not believe it is worth protecting parts of the population who are being persecuted because of their religious background. It is a great pity that we could not accept the amendment which concerns a subject that is of great importance for the future of the world. If we are not able to protect minorities for whatever reason, we no longer have the right to claim that the European Parliament is the home of human rights, of fundamental rights and of this struggle throughout the world. I have voted against this, because religious minorities should not be excluded. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am somewhat surprised that, in this House, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) stands accused of forcing this topic, which, although urgent, is probably not to the liking of any member of the Left majority of this House, onto the agenda. I doubt that they constitute a majority in this House. I simply had to ask that question. Like all the other groups, our group is also perfectly entitled to raise this matter. Even though Mr Chávez, who is currently in power, might be some kind of chum of yours or of the previous Spanish Presidency-in-Office, we still simply have to ask what action is being taken in this regard. I am quite amazed that somebody like Mr Chávez can possibly say things like ‘Twitter is a terrorist system’. I am sorry, but anyone in this day and age who describes Twitter as a terrorist system is living in another world, back in the stone age. Let me tell you this, as well: We, the PPE Group, will not be cowed by this accusation. We denounce violations of human rights everywhere. I personally denounce human rights violations when it comes to freedom of the press. On that score, let me just say that Venezuelan journalists are spoon-fed and dictated to and that judges are thrown into jail if they release someone who has been wrongly arrested. As Europeans, we must have the courage to speak out against such practices. I will not allow Mrs de Keyser and others in this House to pin this accusation on the PPE Group. Like anyone else, we are perfectly entitled to designate violations of human rights and freedoms, whether in Europe or anywhere else across the world, as topics worthy of debate. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I would just like to draw your attention to the fact that all the groups have endorsed this motion for a resolution. That is as it should be, because this topic is very important. In contrast to the previous speakers, I would like to say that we must ensure that we do not merely promote freedom of expression and freedom of the press in this country, but that we also actively demand them, now that we are examining ways that we could help things proceed towards a, hopefully, peaceful election. We have to ensure that we, as Europeans, establish freedom of the press in all areas, with all the financial assistance that is needed to make that possible. We also have to provide full support and endeavour to act together to provide financial assistance, within the scope of the agreements which we have with this country. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 It is commendable that the new Macedonian democracy has made further progress in all areas of society and business. I very much welcome the fact that the presidential and local elections in March 2009 went smoothly. This is an indication of the growing democratisation throughout the entire region which was reflected in Macedonia. Macedonia has met all the criteria for liberalising the visa regulations and, therefore, from 19 December 2009 onwards, its citizens have visa-free status. This represents a major step forward. However, Macedonia still has a number of reforms to implement. I very much hope that we can use the experience which we gathered during the first phase of the eastern enlargement of the EU to help it in this process. In this context, I am thinking of the implementation of institutional reforms, where political foundations and a range of different NGOs have achieved so much. There are two areas where we should strengthen our cooperation with regard to transformation and EU standards. These are reform in the public administration, in the judiciary and in the police. Personally, I would like to see the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece put aside in the immediate future. It is important that progress towards the unification of Europe is not brought to a standstill because of bilateral disagreements. Martin Kastler,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the massacre on 23 November of last year in the Province of Maguindanao in the Philippines was a black day for human rights and a barbaric act of terrorism. Fifty seven people were killed, women were raped, people were injured – they convey a bloody message. As a journalist, it struck me, in particular, that there were 30 journalists among those killed. According to the renowned International Crisis Group, in no other case on record have more journalists ever been murdered at one time. For this reason, it is appropriate for the European Parliament to make a clear statement, as we are doing today in this draft resolution. However, as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we request that the present text be toned down in three places through a split vote, because we ought to support the Philippine Government in its fight against terrorism and violence and therefore dispense with overly accusatory remarks directed at the government. Therefore, on behalf of the PPE Group, I request a separate vote on recital F. This accuses the Philippines of showing all the signs of a non-functional legal system. In paragraph 2, we would like to delete the insinuation about what are referred to as initial delays in the investigation. Finally, in paragraph 6, it is claimed that some missing persons are locked away in Philippine prisons. This, too, is currently an unproven insinuation and should, in our opinion, be deleted.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be voting in favour of this report, as I think that the deepening of cooperation between the European Union and the ACP states within the framework of the partnership agreements is important. That said, I would like to point out that this report contains the wording ‘protection of sexual and reproductive health’. Yet what is behind this phrase? Does it, first of all, mean ensuring people’s physical and mental well-being in relation to all areas of human sexuality and reproduction, for example, by combating sexual violence and genital mutilation? Does it, secondly, mean access to information about what has come to be called family planning? Or, thirdly, does it also include abortion? In the past, the Commission and the Council have made it clear in relation to questions from MEPs that this ‘sexual and reproductive health’ does not include abortion. That is exactly how I see it. I therefore think it important to establish that the term ‘the sexual and reproductive health of women’ is not in the context of abortion and I am therefore proposing a clarification to that effect in the text of the agreement. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what does freedom of religion actually mean? The answer is quite simple. It is the freedom to practise religion. Freedom of religion is not freedom from religion but the freedom to have religion. Freedom of religion does not create a religion-free society, but rather gives people the right to practice their religion openly within society. A crucifix in the classroom does not force anyone to believe, or not to believe. Therefore, it does not violate the freedom of religion. Nor have I ever heard of a right entitling someone not to be confronted with religious symbols. If this were the case, we would, in fact, immediately have to prohibit all crosses on gravestones and all church spires. The crucifix ruling of the European Court of Human Rights is therefore not only an attack on the principle of subsidiarity, but it also violates the right to religious freedom itself. We, the European Parliament, cannot and must not accept this ruling. The European Court of Human Rights should administer justice and not become a puppet for ideological and anti-Christian interests. Otherwise, we will have to seriously consider whether this Court actually still has a purpose at all. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have also voted no, because I am of the opinion that Turkey must first fulfil all the criteria, before we can make such a positive statement here. In particular, I would like to highlight the border dispute between Cyprus and Turkey, which has still not been settled this year, and the illegal occupation of Cyprus, which has not yet been brought to an end. However, I did not want to vote against the other accession candidates. I would particularly make an exception in the case of the Balkan States which I would like to welcome here in this House as soon as possible. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is often the case that good intentions cause problems. No one here would question the fact that non-smokers need comprehensive protection. However, the compromise motion for a resolution on smoke-free environments on which we will be voting on Thursday goes far beyond the protection of non-smokers. Even though the current draft explicitly supports the principle of subsidiarity, it also undermines it. The motion calls for strict and legally binding regulations at EU level. It abuses valid concern for health protection in an attempt to transfer invalid authority in the field of health policy and of work and social issues to a European level. We all want a Europe which is close to its people and the principle of subsidiarity is the key to this. The Member States or, in the case of Germany, the federal states, must have their own discussions on the protection of non-smokers. This is the only way to identify solutions which suit each country’s traditions and culture and are therefore close to its people. For these reasons, I would ask you to vote against the motion for a resolution in its current form on Thursday. Martin Kastler,

Mr President, on 2 October this year, the Iranian police stopped a man from boarding an aircraft at the last minute. The lawyer, Abdolfattah Soltani, was due to receive the International Human Rights Award for 2009 in my home town of Nuremburg for his courageous work on behalf of victims of political persecution. Despite having a valid passport, the Iranian powers refused to allow Mr Soltani to leave the country for no legal reason. His wife was allowed to leave. She rightly stated, and I quote: ‘It pains me that in a country that calls itself a theocracy, acts are committed that have nothing to do with God’. Iran is bound under international law by its ratification of the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which stipulates the human right that everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own. I find it scandalous that Iran is trampling this right underfoot. I am therefore lobbying for the Soltani case to be included in our joint resolution today, in our resolution on Iran, and I ask for your support. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

Mr President, first of all, I agree with fellow Members who have said that old accounts that are still unpaid must be settled. We should do so promptly in order to avoid additional interest which would make them even more expensive. It will not enhance our credibility with the public if we cannot disburse funds that they have applied for and have been granted and to which they are legally entitled.  That is why the amending budget must be formulated as a matter of urgency. The problem that we face for 2013, however, is that if the budget is too low, the amending budget will ultimately be even higher, for the previous year’s commitment appropriations will come back to haunt us, with all their financial implications. I have every understanding for the difficulties posed by crises, but if we genuinely want to make changes, we will have to talk about the commitment appropriations in connection with the multiannual financial framework, and that includes discussing how they should be dealt with. However, the past cannot be dealt with by questioning the law. I am most grateful to the Council and the Cyprus Presidency for engaging in such intensive negotiations. Monika Hohlmeier,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the PPE member responsible for Parliament’s budget, I also want to offer warm thanks to my colleague Derek Vaughan for the close and very fruitful cooperation we have had with all the other shadow rapporteurs. Although Croatia is now also a Member, which has imposed extra costs on the European Parliament, we have managed to stand by a 1.9 % rise, i.e. one that is actually below the normal rate of inflation. To that end, we have also made clear savings in a very wide variety of sectors, which means that we have managed to adopt a draft budget for the European Parliament that is also agreed with the Commission or in line with the Commission’s views. At the same time, however, I would ask those colleagues who may not mean any wrong but basically think we need more and more cuts to the European Parliament’s budget to remember that MEPs must be able to operate under proper working conditions and must also have the chance to review the documents presented by the Commission and proposals such as those put forward by the Member States at the European summit, and then in the end to be able to live with them. We need a competent Parliament, which is why we also need sensible, good and solid funding. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Schengen is one of the greatest achievements in the European Union, however I am also aware that our Member States are sensitive of their borders and are likely to remain so. I am aware that the problems that exist between the Member States in relation to Schengen cannot simply be ignored. These problems are many and varied. Ignoring these problems does not make them any better or easier to resolve. I live near the border with the Czech Republic and no one on our side would ever dream of simply closing the border again when problems are encountered. I would also call on the Commission to offer support in this area, rather than restrictions and rebukes. Dragnet controls were incorporated because we wish to ensure security while still allowing freedom to travel. If we are to be successful in implementing dragnet controls at locations that are frequent crossing points for drug dealers, such as the Czech border in particular, then I believe it is best for the German and Czech interior ministers to sit down together to find a joint solution to the problems that exist at the border. The Commission should not adopt a regulatory role here, but rather a positive supporting role. We wish to rein in the populists, but also to resolve the real problems in a concerted approach. That is why I am also calling on the Council to seek a solution together with Parliament, so that we can successfully conclude the Schengen dossier, upholding freedom to travel while also ensuring the security of our citizens.

 Madam President, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, today, I would like to focus, in particular, on the subject of the agencies. I have noticed that there is no specific focus on financing for the agencies in 2013 or in the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020. To give you a few examples, there are the new supervisory agencies: the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). If these agencies are to do justice to the job which we were discussing once again at the weekend, then they need to be equipped to do it properly, because otherwise, we will ultimately not be able to implement all the plans that we have put in place. Another example is Europol. Europol manages its budget very carefully. In 2011, it had particularly high levels of transfers because some programmes had begun later. The fact that Europol is now being punished with a 10% reduction and is supposed to establish a cybercrime centre with its current funding is simply impossible. We need to ensure that the agencies are properly financed and, at the same time, we need to monitor the management board structures, because I believe that the large number of members on the boards sometimes means that the agencies are managed less efficiently.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to discuss the subject of development aid. The question of budget aid has been a concern for us in the context of development aid for many years. I would like to express my thanks to the Court of Auditors for its numerous very sensible suggestions on this subject. I would also like to thank Commissioner Piebalgs for his increasing efforts to regulate budget aid in a sensible way. Budget aid is appropriate if there is a degree of certainty that the local administration is capable of using this budget aid to implement the projects undertaken in cooperation with the European Union. Secondly, we need to come up with a consistent concept in the area of development aid. I find myself repeating at every discharge hearing that all development aid spending needs to be introduced into the Commission budget at the same time and not just because we want to avoid exceeding the 1% limit. The money will certainly be spent. The question is simply whether it is spent in a coordinated, consistent and mutually agreed way and whether the European Parliament can play a role in spending decisions, rather than just monitoring spending. It is for this reason that I believe it is necessary to focus on the question of long-term and short-term measures in the context of development aid. We need long-term sustainable measures that will lead to improvements in the relevant countries as the years progress. Naturally, we also need short-term measures that can provide rapid relief in response to disasters, such as earthquakes, etc. However, when it comes to long-term projects, we cannot allow standards to be relaxed simply because the conditions in a particular country are not what they might be. Our projects need to make sense and have a purpose, otherwise we will find ourselves spending money for no good reason. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

Madam President, to begin with I would like to thank the European Asylum Support Office which has now started to take highly efficient measures, to give serious help to Greece and to play a very effective role, in particular with regard to what many Members have just called for, in other words, providing reasonable asylum accommodation. A few days ago the Greek Parliament decided that additional accommodation which meets European standards should be built. The European Union will or should give support for this, with the help of the European Asylum Support Office. I believe it is important that we in this Chamber do not constantly talk only about the dreadful things that have happened or the difficulties. Instead we should make it quite clear what we want to do and explain that we are not demanding that Greece comes up with a perfect solution overnight, given its disastrous internal situation. We will be applying realistic standards to the country and to what it is able to achieve. I also think it is sensible that many countries have stopped returning refugees and will continue to do so in future. Secondly, it seems to me to be important for us to extend our cooperation with Turkey. Ms Malmström has said that we are making an effort to do this. I think that amalgamating visa policy and return policy will cause significant problems. However, one possibility might be not to opt for the larger framework for visa policy, but instead to focus only on students and those in similar situations, including business people. This could be a solution for the countries which may currently still have difficulties in this area. Thirdly, we should agree on cooperation between police forces with regard to returning refugees, because this is about combating criminal people traffickers who are making money at the expense of poor refugees. It is not about disagreements with Turkey over questions of content. I hope and believe that Turkey is ready to start cooperating with our police forces on these issues.

Madam President, I believe that we must attempt, in collaboration with the European Asylum Support Office and the Greek authorities, to identify which of the people who have come to Greece could possibly be transferred to other countries within the European Union, firstly, because they can definitely never return to their home country and, secondly, because they may have potential and qualifications which are appropriate and useful. However, this is essentially also about helping the Greeks to register and identify these people more quickly, so that help can be provided sooner and so that those people who do not have qualifications or the entitlement to live in Greece or the European Union can be returned to their home countries, because they do have the opportunity of remaining there.

Mr President, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, ITER is a long-term research project. This means that we cannot simply shelve the treaties that we have entered into and the future plans that we have made in the important area of energy research every time we encounter a crisis or financial difficulties. We cannot decide not to comply with these treaties any longer and to turn a technology of the future into a technology of the past. I was somewhat suspicious about the claim that this technology should be a thing of the past. I was suspicious because we did not make smooth progress during the 30 years of research simply as a result of the fact that 30 years ago we did not have the computer capacity that we have today, which we needed both for materials research and for managing the high temperatures. This is why we have only been able to forge ahead rapidly with the ITER research in recent years. When we launch large projects, we must ensure that they are on a sound financial footing right from the start. This is a lesson which we need to learn within the European Union with regard to a variety of projects. When we start projects, they must have a professional project management team from the very beginning, an accurate and realistic estimate of costs, not simply one which sounds good in political terms, detailed financial controlling, a professional tendering process and a project support and monitoring function which can guarantee us an overview of the actual costs in the short and medium term. This is a long-term research project. It will not be completed in a short period and this is why I believe it is necessary for us not only to continue with this project, but also to acknowledge its future prospects. I have been to Cadarache myself and I have a different impression from yours, Ms Durant. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to give my sincere thanks to Mr Vaughan, the main rapporteur, and also to my fellow rapporteurs. We have worked very closely together and shared detailed information in the attempt to identify sensible solutions which would allow us to take the first step towards producing estimates of revenue and expenditure. I believe that it is very much worth mentioning that the increase in funding for the European Parliament is below the rate of inflation and that we will be carrying out an intensive and systematic evaluation of Parliament’s spending between now and the autumn, in order to identify further potential for cutting costs. In this context, we want to make it very clear to the public that while we are aware that the European Parliament needs a sensible level of resources to be able to work effectively, we also want to exploit every opportunity to introduce savings. From my perspective, this also involves making careful use of money where we take measures relating to the building. In this respect, it is also important to mention that we have already made some initial savings and that we have been able to bring about a significant reduction in some excessive rents. As far as bringing everything together on one site is concerned, I would like to suggest that we calculate the costs and the consequences of moving to one site, rather than just quoting the fictitious costs resulting from the journeys caused by being based at different sites. This will be necessary in order to carry out a useful analysis, since there are officials who do not have to travel at all, because they have no direct connection with Parliament and its work. Under these circumstances, moving to one site would not bring any benefits. We simply need to analyse the situation carefully and impartially. I would like to thank my fellow Members once again, because I believe that we are submitting good estimates. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the nature of the debate in this House shows that we represent the entire spectrum of opinion: on the one side, we have those who do not want restrictions of any kind, while on the other are those who associate any form of immigration with the risk of a massive influx of people. These are the two extremes to be found within the House. Family reunification must be viewed with a great deal of common sense and rationalism. On the one hand, problems genuinely exist in Member States with excessively restrictive policies. After all, we cannot put so many obstacles in the way of reuniting families that, in the end, reunification becomes an impossibility. On the other hand, Member States are fully justified in demanding language skills and integration, for example, or at least a willingness to integrate within a state. Secondly, the Member States naturally have the right to point out the problems that arise with family reunification, problems that should not be swept under the carpet. If countries like Greece, Malta, Romania or Italy are no longer permitted to indicate the problems they experience in this context, then I am not certain that we are taking a democratic approach by simply ignoring problems. We do not need another new directive. We should debate the problems carefully and then consider how we can remedy them. The continuous production of new directives will not lead to an improvement in the directives or their implementation. We are currently experiencing implementation problems in some areas. I completely understand that we need to engage in debate first, rather than drawing up yet another new directive and adding something to it before we have thoroughly discussed the old directive and the associated problems. I am in favour of listening to the Member States and of respecting the basic right of family reunification. If this is done in a reasoned and understanding way, then we will also achieve some progress. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by sincerely thanking my colleague, the rapporteur Mr Vaughan, for his excellent cooperation and his readiness to discuss the various problems in depth and to find a solution. We already presented an austerity budget last year, in which the actual original budget only rose by 0.8% and, in view of the additional costs incurred through the accession of Croatia and the Treaty of Lisbon, we still remained below the inflation rate of 1%, achieving 1.9%. This year, we are again publishing guidelines for an austerity budget, seeking to show that we are aware that we are in an environment in which it is not possible to make enormous financial leaps forward, but rather that consolidation is the order of the day, so that the budget will need to be examined in terms of efficiency and the potential for cutting costs. I also welcome the convening of a working group that is to bring in external experts as deemed necessary and useful, to work in this direction with the Bureau, the Secretariat and Parliament’s administration. I also believe it is right for us to further strengthen interinstitutional cooperation and that we should further optimise the way in which Parliament works in terms of organisation, efficiency, the use of financial resources and personnel. This has enabled us to save EUR 21 million in the area of translation and interpreting alone in a single year and we want to continue in this vein this year. As Mr Vaughan has said, we are freezing travel costs and day-to-day expenses and, with regard to buildings policy – after all I am the rapporteur on buildings – I believe it necessary for us to examine closely what we have agreed to see whether buildings policy and construction projects are being managed in a professional, cost-efficient manner. The particular aim will be to save costs in the medium term, in particular annually recurring costs, and to exploit the relevant synergies. We also expect the other institutions to join us in our efforts and to offer their support. I believe it is necessary for us to navigate a course in which the precise work of Parliament is linked with efficiency and good organisation. I would like to thank the Parliament administration, the Secretariat and the Bureau for their excellent cooperation and hope that we succeed in presenting a reasonable, solid and well-considered budget.

We voted against the report on the recasting of the regulation on public access to documents. The report goes far beyond the objective of achieving greater transparency by improving public access to documents. Existing legislation and interinstitutional agreements are ignored and the protection of intellectual property, sensitive and personal data is treated with contempt. Administrative processes and decisions, including those relating to personnel issues, should be published. The same applies to the protection of trade secrets and sensitive information within the framework of approval procedures, court proceedings and competition procedures. The report contains definitions that are vague, lack clarity and cast their net too widely. Any data or content connected in any way with the policies, measures and decisions of all bodies and institutions of the EU is defined as a document. This largely also includes preparatory, confidential and secret documents, as well as all associated information. Thus, the definition covers not only documents, but also information. The publication of information from ongoing interinstitutional processes, such as informal trialogue negotiations, enables public access to the procedure. This would open up the possibility of external influence. Lobbyists would have direct access to the legislative process. This report does not benefit our citizens. It would lead to a deluge of useless information, leading to a greater lack of transparency and rendering our work impossible. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, Ms Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control have both paid great attention to ensuring that in future the ITER project will be well managed, its finances will be monitored, its funding will be properly evaluated and the financial increases will be kept within reasonable bounds. However, I believe it is a major problem, in the case of a project established jointly by the Member States, which the Member States have decided on in the Council, when the Council opts in the same breath to increase research funding and extend the financing available for research and this results in cuts in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, in order to make more money available for ITER. This was not what was originally decided on by the Member States. Agreement was reached in the trialogue and my admiration goes to the rapporteur who showed the patience of a saint in attempting to ensure that progress was made in the negotiations. I would like to know how we in Europe are supposed to improve our global reputation when we demonstrate that we are lacking in unity and unable to agree in the context of a large international project. Making a note of this kind in the minutes about an amount of EUR 360 million, which retrospectively calls into question a joint compromise reached in the trialogue, is a simply disgraceful way of presenting ourselves to the rest of the world. We should see ITER as a really important project and Parliament is prepared to do this. However, in this case the Member States need to make some sensible proposals on financing the decision that they have reached, without once again interfering with the field of research. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am rather bewildered to hear some fellow Members saying that this directive would allegedly encourage unchecked mass immigration. The reality is the exact opposite. We are talking here about those with a proper work and residence permit, and if they are doing the same work as an EU citizen, then such people should also receive the same usual types of social benefits within the European Union as any other person would get. This safeguards those who work properly and with the right papers; it is not opening any floodgates. I also find it most amusing that some Members are complaining that too many groups are excluded, while others are complaining that mass immigration will take place. I congratulate the rapporteur. She seems to have found the golden middle way between giving the Member States the necessary individual powers of differentiation in certain decision areas and, on the other hand, providing a certain guarantee of social security for those working according to the rules. It should be a matter of course that family benefits depend on length of stay, but that someone who has earned a pension is able to take it with them if they have worked according to the rules. I therefore find it rather strange that people’s concerns that many workers will be crowded out of the labour market are being fuelled here. This directive has nothing to do with that.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in contrast to the previous speaker, I would like to begin by observing that, in my view, the European Parliament does not wish to express a resolution of no confidence in the Council. In other words, the motion that we are tabling does not mean that we have a lack of confidence in the Council or assume that funds are misspent. I do have a concern that the Council should give much more consideration to stronger cooperation with Parliament and collaboration between the three institutions. I will illustrate with an example. I am the rapporteur for real estate. It would be highly beneficial if the three institutions would coordinate with each other much better when it comes to buildings. The taxpayers would also be grateful, as perhaps then we could act more effectively and more in concert instead of as three institutions doing everything separately. The same applies, as I see it, to interpreters and other areas. We should work together. The general population can no longer be expected to understand how we do not even answer each other’s questions. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to thank Bulgaria and Romania for the impressive efforts that they have made. They have not only fulfilled the technical details of the Schengen Agreement, but have also taken very specific measures at their borders in order to safeguard the external borders of the European Union. The claim that they have only met the small-scale technical requirements is simply wrong. Everyone can go to these borders and see what Bulgaria and Romania have done to bring about a massive improvement in standards and in education and training and to see the measures that have been taken to secure the external borders. In my opinion, their efforts have been significantly underestimated. Secondly, the subject of corruption has repeatedly been mentioned, together with organised crime. I think it is right for us to discuss these matters and I also think it is right for us to take serious measures to combat corruption and organised crime within the context of the Schengen Agreement. However, laying the responsibility solely at the door of Bulgaria and Romania is wrong. There are also significant problems relating to corruption and organised crime within the Schengen countries. Therefore, against this background, and with regard to securing the external borders, I am calling specifically for the fulfilment of the Schengen Agreement in all the Member States to be evaluated, because it is necessary to ensure that all the Schengen countries meet the requirements, not only those which want to join. We need long-term safeguards and not simply short-term demands on two Member States. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur and Mr Klinz and, in particular, our coordinator Mr Karas, who has ensured that this is not only a balanced report, but also contains many passages that make worthwhile reading and that are essential for the future of the European Union and its 27 Member States. In today’s climate of global competition, it is no longer possible for every Member State to go it alone. I believe that competition is an important and necessary instrument. However, I also believe it is important for our 27 Member States to have joint strategies for the globalised financial markets and in relation to our major competitors on the other continents. I am not in favour of more Europe across the board, but I do advocate more Europe in areas where the 27 can only succeed by pooling their efforts. In this context, we have discussed key points in relation to the financial markets, pointing out, in particular, that we cannot achieve greater economic growth simply through financial trading, but rather that the answer lies in coordinated and sustainable economic activity. For this reason, I find this to be a very good report. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, I would like to raise two points in relation to cohesion policy and regional policy. The first is the dispute regarding the so-called intermediate category, which runs very much along national lines. I believe it is essential for us to consider the following points in relation to this discussion: regional policy and economic development policy must offer an incentive system so that the relevant regions can develop. If the system is set up in such a way that a dependency on continuous subsidy develops without requiring effort among the regions to obtain the relevant resources, then I believe that such an intermediate category would be an unmitigated disaster because it will always be a bone of contention and offers no rationale. However, I do believe that it makes sense for Objective 1 regions that lose their Objective 1 status to continue to receive special support. I also believe it makes sense that a region that is experiencing financial and economic difficulties for specific reasons should also receive support. What we do not want is a continuous subsidy mentality; instead we should offer help and support to the regions that need it. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by saying something about the comments on the House of European History. As rapporteur for buildings I would firstly like to say that the figure of EUR 136 million is definitely incorrect. Secondly, we are not talking about a prestige project here; after all, we are constantly complaining that people know nothing of European development since the Second World War, and we now want to make sure that two to three million people a year get to know these developments and find out more about them – so that perhaps they will be less Eurosceptic. We should debate together the level of the operating costs and the synergies that may be able to be realised with the information centre. A great many Members have taken part in the debate. However, the debate has only just become public, with the result that some Members do not yet feel they have been adequately informed. I will be happy to provide assistance with such discussions or requests for information. I consider the project to be necessary and useful, because people need to find out more about European development – otherwise there will be more and more Eurosceptics. Secondly, on the subject of development aid. I would first like to thank Mr Staes warmly for the fact that we have genuinely achieved a joint report in many, many respects that I can categorically support. I consider it essential that we set development aid priorities in the areas of infrastructure, health, education and particularly agriculture, and in particular I think that perhaps we should consider introducing an evaluation of projects after 10 years. It is not our aim to start only short-term projects that in the final event have no lasting effect. Moreover, we should make sure that we achieve better coordination of development aid with the Member States and also are able to implement once and for all the integration of the entire development aid budget into the EU budget, because it is incomprehensible why only part of our development aid is included in the EU budget. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Madam President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, the House’s budget for 2012 is set against the background of a difficult economic and financial situation. That is why I see it as a positive development that we have agreed in the basic guidelines that Parliament’s budget is to be drawn up carefully within the framework of only modest increases and that adjustments should not exceed the inflation rate. I believe the target mentioned by Mr Fernandes, in relation to youth employment is very important because in our last budget we were very concerned that more money should be provided for youth than was previously the case because it is young people in particular who are affected by unemployment or who need special support, including from Europe. That is why I believe the additional EUR 100 million is a very positive approach. As the rapporteur on buildings, I would particularly like to point out that I believe it is extremely important for us to maintain a high level of efficiency in relation to the financing of our buildings and to monitor the financial situation with care. In this context I believe it is right that financial resources that cannot be spent on Parliament’s budget over the course of the year should be used as prudently as possible to avoid interest payments. In this regard it is also necessary to ensure that the monies are not spent in a mad rush at the end of the year, but rather that they are used to pay off buildings more quickly and more economically. In relation to the House of European History, we shall ensure that the operating plan is carefully examined once again and that the construction costs are closely monitored so that, crucially, an orderly budget can also be presented after the building is complete following notification in accordance with Article 179(3). Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks for the many talks we were able to have with the rapporteur and also with the Commissioner and shadow rapporteurs. This enabled good compromises to be reached in some areas. As Mrs Malmström just mentioned, this includes the compromise on free legal assistance, in particular, for the special protection of minors. Other achievements include the fact that we were able to agree on which applicants were particularly worthy of protection and, in our talks with one another, we were able to find a sensible compromise. Over and above that, we also found a compromise with regard to the subject of safe third countries. The aim is to fundamentally improve the quality of the administrative procedures so that there are fewer hearings in court in the second and third instance, in order to provide asylum seekers who are genuinely facing persecution with as rapid and as consistently effective assistance and protection as possible. I am strongly in favour of there being appropriate minimum standards in all Member States. Unfortunately, however, both the Commission’s text and some of the individual amendments intended to amend the Commission’s text to a certain extent do the opposite of what this good intention is striving to achieve. Many opportunities have been created to delay procedures or even to massively abuse asylum law. I will give you a few examples of this. For example, an applicant can make three inadmissible applications and has the right to go through the full procedure three times. Only then can an accelerated procedure be carried out. A procedure cannot be accelerated if someone is clearly not recognised as a refugee under the Geneva Convention. In this regard, I would simply mention the subject of Tunisia and also that of economic migrants. Another example is the fact that an accelerated procedure will also not be possible if subsequent applications are made without any relevant new content. What I consider to be even more serious, however, is the subject of disappearing. If someone illegally disappears, his application can no longer be closed with a negative decision. He has to countersign the letter. Therefore, if an asylum seeker were expecting news of a negative decision, all he would need to do – if we were to adopt the motion put forward by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – would be to refuse to accept the letter or not be there to receive it. The consequence of that would be that he could prolong the procedure indefinitely. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the 2012 budget is set against the background of a difficult economic and financial situation in the 27 Member States. For this reason, we will certainly not be able to afford to do everything that we would like to do. I believe that the report tabled by Mrs Balzani is a workable compromise. However, I also have a few critical remarks to make. In my opinion, more money does not necessarily mean more solidarity and more Europe. What is important is to improve the quality of what we get in return for the money spent and above all to ensure that the objectives we set ourselves are actually achieved rather than the money merely being paid out regardless. We must always examine the question of our potential new own resources with a critical eye, too. These own resources must not lead to the additional burdening of citizens or of businesses that need to be, and should be, able to compete with the rest of the world. I also think it is important for us not always to emphasise the fact that the EU budget amounts to only 2% because, at the end of the day, many States cofinance the corresponding European funds, thus, of course, making a considerably larger volume of funds available on the basis of EU programmes. I think it is particularly important for us to make progress in terms of research, education, sustainability and strengthening economic growth. In light of this, I think it is also important for large-scale projects such as ITER – and in this regard I would like to thank Mrs Jensen for her comment – to be fully and clearly financed and clearly managed, because otherwise the Americans, who are currently implementing the same project, will be appreciably ahead of us, and we Europeans should not always take second place.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to express my regret and dismay that neither the Secretary-General nor the two vice-presidents with responsibility for the European Parliament are present. We normally expect from the Commission that its responsible members should be present; we should also expect the same from our most senior representative. Secondly, I would like to address the subject of the management of the House’s buildings. I welcome the fact that the KAD project in Luxembourg is making progress, that it would seem that the costs are under control, and that things are going according to plan. When the KAD extension project is complete, bringing staff together under one roof should lead to greater efficiency and synergy, as well as reducing annual costs, because eight offices will be closed. It is essential that this target should be met as we need some of these funds for other purposes, as Mr Fernandes has pointed out. I believe that the House of European History is an important project because it will attract many visitors, who will be offered an insight into the significance, aims and purpose of the European Union in the context of European history in a very effective way. Thirdly, I would ask that the staff appointed in Luxembourg should be relocated to Brussels. Because they frequently need to work in Brussels, they are constantly travelling back and forth, also causing problems for the Members. This only applies to a small number of sub-areas and relocation really should be considered on efficiency grounds. Fourthly, I think it a very good thing that the European Parliament is only making provision for moderate expansion. The fact that other areas are only expanding on a modest scale should not be taken by the EEAS as a reason for massive expansion. I would call on all institutions to cut their cloth to their measure in these times of economic and financial difficulty. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, it is important that the EU comes to grips with the problems of migration and the right of asylum. The Commission has submitted proposals in this area. However, there is currently no accurate analysis of the implementation of existing legal provisions. There are also hardly any detailed calculations and analyses concerning the new proposals. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wholeheartedly supports the right of asylum and the right to protection for people who need it. However, when we look at the actual situation, it is unfortunately clear that people are applying for asylum for very different reasons or even systematically abusing the system. The right of asylum and subsidiary protection is not a tool for general migration into the 27 Member States. We must ensure that the organised people traffickers do not have the opportunity to make billions of euro in profit out of people’s fates as a result of our right of asylum. Asylum procedures must be fit for purpose and they must be implemented with great care. Victims of persecution must be guaranteed a refuge in the EU. This is why the Commission’s obligations in this respect are laid down in the new drafts. I think many of them are appropriate, including interpreters, proper healthcare and taking into consideration special protection needs. However, I would also like to mention the points which I believe are problematic. The authorities in the Member States are being given far too few opportunities to prevent abuse. The option of the accelerated procedure and the border procedure should be restricted by applying charges. If an applicant commits a serious breach of his duty of cooperation, there are very few possibilities of imposing sanctions. On the contrary, if an asylum seeker disappears, the Member State cannot bring the procedure to a negative conclusion. If he reappears, he is offered an extended range of procedural options. Even if an application is obviously without any foundation, the use of the accelerated procedure will only be possible after the second subsequent application. This will lead to significant cost increases. The current Commission draft states that free legal advice will be available from a lawyer, which will also result in the Member States’ costs rising considerably. I would simply like the Commission to reconsider the practical consequences of its proposals, the financial impact and the problems for the authorities in the Member States. We want to see a system with high standards, but it must be workable and should not present already overburdened Member States with completely impossible tasks. Monika Hohlmeier,  
author.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, thank you very much for allowing me to speak again briefly. I have a request for you, Mr Füle. I would like to start by saying that incorrect assumptions lead to incorrect cost estimates. At the moment, the number of asylum seekers is not falling, but rising significantly. This is a result of visa facilitation, for example, for Serbia and Macedonia. We are currently also seeing a massive increase in abuses of the asylum system as part of attempts to enter countries in the European Union. If you start with incorrect assumptions, in other words, that disputing the first instance in detail will save costs in subsequent instances, it will automatically seem as if all Member States have poor first-instance procedures. However, that is not the case. If overall standards are raised, the consequence will be cost increases. Improving the standard of quality for everyone and making the procedures more complex will, in reality, result in increased costs. I am more than happy to discuss this point. Therefore, I would like to ask you specifically to take the concerns of the countries seriously, because some of the practical reports from the countries have already been completed and will be distributed. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to make it clear, following repeated claims in this House, that during the budget negotiations, we have not requested a single cent more than the Council had offered us. This means that we were completely in line with the Council’s wishes. On the subject of the flexibility instrument, we need it because the Council regularly gets us into difficulties with its decisions on major projects for which it has not made provision for the funding. We then have to attempt, together with the Member States, to find a solution for these projects, in order to be able to support them financially and to make sensible plans. We have also not demanded more than what is laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. Instead, we are calling for compliance with the treaty. Nothing else, nothing more and nothing less. On the subject of own resources, it is surely not asking too much for Parliament to say that it would at least like to discuss the issue, what form it could take and whether own resources are in place. They cannot simply refuse to talk about this and then put the blame on Parliament. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, later on, we will be attending the reception for the deepening of relations between the European Union and the United States. The fact that this is happening today of all days is particularly significant. All of us will then have the opportunity to tell the ambassador what we have just underlined here in plenary. We ought to take the opportunity to do this in person. The United States of America is not making our work particularly easy at the moment, and it is not making our friendship very easy, either. On many issues, I have the impression that what we are seeing is more like a bull in a china shop than a performance on the elegant political stage. The EUR 14 alone is certainly not a decisive factor. However, if a family with three children wants to visit the United States of America, it then becomes a considerable amount and may ultimately prevent them from travelling there. On top of that, if you have to give extensive details on the Internet about which airline you are travelling with, where you are travelling to, which hotel you are staying in and, in addition, you have to give your credit card number, it raises a number of questions as to why all of this is necessary. If, in addition, you then hear the accounts of some good acquaintances who have had to wait for hours at American airports and experience the discourteous security control, then you sometimes ask yourself whether the United States of America is actually aware that in many areas, it is currently treating its own friends rather discourteously and perhaps, in certain respects in relation to what people actually need and have to do, it is way off the mark. Furthermore, with regard to our close transatlantic relations, I have to say that we do have a close relationship with the United States. However, this should also mean that we are treated accordingly. I call on the Commission and on you, Mr Šefčovič, to make a clear demand for visa-free travel to be ensured for those Member States that do not currently enjoy this facility, and if this is not followed by an appropriate reaction, then please also demand that reciprocity be introduced. It is not a question of ‘an eye for an eye’, but we must negotiate on equal terms and we must not allow ourselves to be treated in the same way that a feudal lord would treat his serfs. We are not serfs; we are of equal stature. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I note that the Council does not wish to debate the multiannual financial framework. May I tell the Council that the European Parliament would very much like to debate it, and that the Council cannot act as if it is in a kindergarten by telling us that it will not answer our questions or comment on our proposals. Secondly, in this connection, I must ask the Council whether it wants to have Lisbon or not. Lisbon is not a mere technical adjustment; it imposes more competences and means there are more responsibilities to discharge – and that includes answering related financial questions. Moreover, the Council has taken decisions that result in new financial expenditure. That has been mentioned by many of my fellow Members. If the Council wishes to do this, and if it does not want more money to be spent, then it must also state quite specifically where and how it wishes savings to be made, where exactly these funds are to be shifted from – and not simply propose general percentages to be redeployed while leaving Parliament and the Commission with the unpleasant task of deciding where the money is to be taken from, especially since our opportunities for redeployment and budgetary revision are extremely limited. The additional responsibilities that you have imposed on us are so challenging that they do not involve small incidental amounts – I will merely mention the area of the financial solidarity of our Member States and their corresponding financial difficulties. If the programme is to be implemented, then we are not taking about small sums that can be redeployed without further consideration. The same applies to ITER, the same applies to matters of internal security, the same applies to significant matters relating to research, the same also applies to questions concerning Parliament’s priority areas such as youth training and research. We have to deal not only with shortcomings in implementation, but also with a lack of transparency when it comes to the disbursement of funds. We need to debate and work through all these matters quite specifically; the Council cannot simply keep silent on them. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all of the Member States of the European Union are suffering under the burden of huge debts and from the effects of the financial and economic crisis. However, they are also suffering as a result of the fact that, for years, high budget deficits – some of which are excessive – have been accepted and tolerated in a large number of countries. When we start to tackle the new 2011 budget it is not enough merely to reduce the budgets of the Member States. We also need to undertake a thorough review of the expenditure from our budget and also carefully review new expenditure. I would mention the European External Action Service, the structure and also the financing of which is still extremely unclear. There is no transparent structure. I would also call for cost-efficiency by using the synergies with national external action services. There must be clear rules regarding responsibilities and a transparent rendering of accounts to the European Parliament, and attempts should not be made to void the European Parliament’s codecision and supervision roles in more and more decisions. The European Parliament is cooperative and will also be supportive in difficult situations. For this reason, we must also involve the European Parliament in these matters as co-decision-maker. Furthermore, I think it is necessary for us at last to make the reduction in bureaucracy a reality, for example in agriculture and also for small and medium-sized enterprises, which urgently need to grow and to implement and cope with innovations. If we want to reduce budgetary deficits, as well as taxes, and increase tax revenues, we need to reduce the burden of bureaucracy on small and medium-sized enterprises and enable innovation, and we must finally reduce the merciless competition exerted by large-scale industry on unpopular small and medium-sized enterprises, and not encourage it. I also share the view of the Chair of our Committee on Budgets that we first need precise data regarding this budget before we can finally adopt it. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE
).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to discuss the problems with development aid that are nearly always emphasised by the Court of Auditors and to thank Mrs Ayala Sender for her good cooperation that was remarkably pleasant. Firstly, there is often the problem of budget support. That means that there is even suspicion that in countries where we are trying to help the population a little, budget support is partly being used by corrupt and totalitarian regimes to suppress undesirable population groups or even critics. I am extremely critical of this budget support. It should be reduced or stopped for countries in which we clearly have problems with the use of budget support. Secondly, now as before, we have the problem that the payments often contain errors, that there is a lack of coordination and targeting of development aid projects between the different institutions and levels in one country and there is no recognisable setting of priorities. It is essential that this is made a matter of priority, so that we can improve the sustainability and effectiveness of projects in those countries where people really are in dire need. Furthermore, now as before, I consider it essential that development aid and the European Development Fund in general are integrated into the overall budget. On pre-accession aid for Turkey I would like to say that I was surprised that the completely normal criticism which, in other countries, would have long since led to the blocking and withholding of financing, has led so quickly to a hiccup in the cooperation between Turkey and the Commission. I consider it completely normal that we firstly lay down the strategy and the goals, then the timeframes, the project orientation, the yardsticks for measuring and then the method of performance monitoring. However, if all of this is lacking and projects are implemented that are then declared successful, I have a problem with the way the programme is implemented. For this reason, I personally consider it necessary that at least part of the funding is withheld until it we have suitable assurances that the funds will be properly spent. We have now reached a compromise, but I consider it necessary to monitor the problem, since other countries like Bulgaria, Romania or Greece will be affected. I think it is necessary that everyone be treated in the same way and not differently. Therefore, I ask that in the area of buildings policy, provision be made for a medium-term building strategy by means of clear construction and financial planning. Large projects should receive their own budget lines and a reporting system related to construction progress, and we should not pay any more costs for bridging lenders. As we are such large institutions, we need buildings and they must be planned carefully and transparently. My last point is that I believe it is necessary to simplify the programmes as a matter of urgency, since that is how problems in the respective countries arise, and this must not simply remain a rhetorical demand, but must finally be implemented. (Applause) Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unlike the previous speaker, I would expressly like to thank both Commissioner Malmström and Commissioner Reding for their intensive efforts to take up the issues that have been raised by Parliament, as well as the problems that we see and have seen in the area of data security and confidentiality, in order to negotiate with the United States. I am also grateful that key issues – as mentioned by my fellow Members – have already been analysed or considered in the mandate and that, in particular, this also includes issues in the area of inspection as well as the area of reciprocity. On the matter of the erasure of data, I also consider it very important to be able to renegotiate the five-year period, since it is really not acceptable to hold data for such a long time. I also feel it is important to ultimately discuss the matter of penalties in cases of deliberate extraction to the wrong ends in sensitive circumstances, since that prevents certain things being extracted that we do not want to see extracted. The focus should only be on terrorism. To me, what is also important is the idea that we have to tackle our own TFTP and that in the longer term, we cannot transfer bulk data, that is to say, large amounts of data to the United States. That has nothing to do with mistrust, but the fact that in the long term, we ultimately want to take our own responsibility within Europe on an equal footing, and then exchange specific extracted data for the sole purpose of combating terrorism and finally maintain real reciprocity. In this context, I would again like to ask the Commission to indicate how the topic of our own TFTP is viewed within the Commission and in the joint discussion with the Council.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am astonished by the discussion on the part of fellow Members who, on the one hand, speak of simplifications for small and medium-sized enterprises, but who, when it comes to taking the very first step for micro-entities – and that is all we are talking about today, not about any other scale – are already inclined to say no again. We cannot always demand something and then subsequently say no. I have spoken with many micro-entities. They are hoping and waiting for this regulation. I have spoken to regional banks, who stressed very clearly to me that it would not be a problem for them at all if financial reporting was changed; they use other data any way. Furthermore, there will be absolutely no change in terms of transparency, because – as the Commissioner has explained – provisions will remain in force so that transparency is also maintained. Trade will not be affected, because the micro-entities do not have an impact on the European market in the sense of trading throughout Europe. I call on fellow Members to take this step with us and thank Mr Lehne and the committee for their excellent work. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 My decision to vote against the interim SWIFT agreement is not a decision against cooperation with the USA on combating terrorism. I emphatically advocated that a new, compatible agreement that would allow European and US security authorities to work closely together and enable them to detect money transfers with suspected links to terrorism should be created as swiftly as possible. However, there are major flaws in the interim agreement, including inadequate provisions as regards data deletion, rights of complaint and access to information and onward transmission to third parties. Moreover, what I expect from a genuine partnership between the European Union and the USA is one which does not merely leave the responsibility for ensuring security of citizens within the framework of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (TFTP) in US hands, but which also provides a clearly defined time-frame for the development of a European TFTP, in partnership with the USA, within the European Union, as well. For this reason, I hope that an agreement will be negotiated, in the nearest future, which still provides a long-term basis for jointly combating terrorism worldwide, in terms of detecting terrorist networks and their financial transactions, but which respects citizens’ data privacy, as well.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the focus until now has been on the cohesion fund and this is certainly justified because of the size of the budget. However, I would now like to draw attention to an area in which only EUR 2.7 billion was spent last year, but which causes significant problems. The European Court of Auditors, which I would like to thank warmly at this point, has produced a semi-masterpiece, as it has succeeded in bringing transparency to the fragmented administration in the area of development aid and in clearly identifying the problems which continue to occur. I would not like to go as far as saying that this area has no universal principle and no transparent structures, but it does have considerable problems. There have been improvements, for example, in the payments for projects, but nevertheless it is still the case that no audits can be carried out on some of the projects because the receipts are missing, not to mention the fact that some receipts are not even provided in the first place or that there are no opportunities for follow-up audits. The subject of budget aid once again involves particular problems because it is not possible to follow up or trace the money and what it is used for. In my opinion, we should carefully consider finally integrating the European Development Fund (EDF) into the general budget, for reasons of transparency, traceability and manageability. This would allow us to combine and coordinate the EDF with other fields, such as development aid, foreign policy, neighbourhood policy and other policies in the same area, so that we could obtain a complete and transparent overview. This is my proposal.Albert Deß,

 Mr President, Ms Reding, ladies and gentlemen, a secure supply of sugar for the European market must be the top priority of European sugar policy. The reform of the sugar regime in 2006 made the European Union dependent on imports, at least in part. Ms Reding has just mentioned the figures. The result of the reform is that imports amounting to 15% of consumption are now needed on a permanent basis. However, after the imports fell below expected levels because of poor harvests in some important sugar producing countries and the resulting rise in world market prices, the Commission has, in my opinion, taken the right measures. It has made importing additional amounts of sugar easier. More than 500 000 tonnes have been imported without duty being paid. It has also enabled domestic producers of sugar and isoglucose to sell part of their non-quota production on the food market. The amount in this case is also 500 000 tonnes. Against this background, it is clear that the Commission has achieved the balance referred to in the questions. I very much support what Ms Reding has said in this respect. The sugar market regime has the necessary instruments to secure the supply and to guarantee a fair balance across the different interests. The risk of redundancies has been mentioned, in particular, by the first speaker, and I would like to refer to what Mr Tarabella said. Thousands of jobs were lost during the reform of the sugar regime. In my constituency in the Upper Palatinate area of Germany, one of the oldest sugar refineries in Europe was closed with the loss of hundreds of jobs. Our goal must not be to ensure that every single job is secure, despite the fact that I regret every redundancy. Instead, we must ensure that there is a balance. I believe it will be good for the sugar regime reform to be extended until 2020. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Albert Deß  (PPE

Thank you, Ms Ludford. In the past, we had excessively high sugar prices in Europe. During the reform of the sugar regime in 2006 and also beforehand, sugar beet prices in Europe fell by around 40%. This meant that sugar beet producers suffered massive cuts. There have been major fluctuations in prices on the world market. There was a time when sugar was much more expensive on the world market than in Germany. At that point, none of the African, Caribbean and Pacific states were supplying Europe. The problem was that there were inconsistencies. Ms Ludford, if we in Europe abolish the sugar regime, we will be even more exposed to fluctuations in prices and European consumers will have to pay a bitter price. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, as one of the few people in this Chamber to have actually been a lorry driver myself, I voted against this today, even though Mr Higgins has done some good work. There were two main reasons for this. Firstly, it was because Parliament voted in favour of Amendment 134, which lowered the tonnage limit of the vehicles from 3.5 tonnes to 2.8 tonnes. I consider that excessive; it was not necessary. Above all, in the end I voted against the motion because Amendment 129 was rejected. This amendment called for the radius for approved exemptions to be extended to 150 kilometres. I am from the Upper Palatinate. Munich is 130 kilometres away. My tradesmen work in Munich a great deal, and now they have to install tachographs because they work in Munich. I am particularly annoyed that the only other Member from the Upper Palatinate region, Ismail Ertug, voted against the interests of tradesmen in our region on these two points. I have great hopes that this will be corrected again at second reading, so that tradesmen who work in areas some distance away from their own will not be disadvantaged. Albert Deß  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner Dalli, I am very pleased that you are here because I know that you are always sympathetic to our concerns. It is very good that you should be made aware of the problems of milk producers. Opinions differ on the milk quota, even within my own group. I often find myself in agreement with my colleague from Luxembourg, Ms Lulling, however we differ on this point. We, the nine representatives of the German conservative group (CSU) from the last electoral term, already voted en bloc against increasing the quota in 2008. The esteemed Commissioner at the time, Ms Fischer Boel, understood the term ‘soft landing’ to mean an increasing of the quota. Increasing the quota means more volume and more volume means lower prices. This is a fairly simple formula. This is precisely the problem we are faced with at present because there are farmers in the European Union who are delivering too much quota, causing a distortion in the milk market. I am against reducing the super levy or increasing the quota even further, because dairy farmers also need some contractual security. The quota will be phased out on 31 March 2015 and we need contractual security by then. We also need other important systems, Mr Dalli: fixed payment deadlines, net-net prices and binding supply volumes. These are the key points we need to work on in order to prepare for a market without quotas. Albert Deß  (PPE
),  
Blue-card question.

 Mr Ferreira, I have just one brief supplementary question: Did you know that in 2008, when the Council discussed increasing the quota, Portugal also voted in favour of this expansion and that only two countries were against increasing the quota, namely Germany and Austria? France abstained from voting. Twenty-four countries, including Portugal, voted to increase the quota, thereby undermining the quota system. Albert Deß  (PPE
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, thank you; I asked to speak because we still have some time left. I will be brief. I would like everyone who talks about the absolute freedom of the milk market, whether from my own group or from other groups, to take the following to heart: from 2015 onwards we shall also have to discontinue the historical payments per hectare. We cannot have a situation where milk producers in Latvia receive EUR 100 per hectare, while producers in other countries receive over EUR 1 000 on the basis of historical premiums. This does not constitute fair competition. A milk producer who receives compensation payments of EUR 1 000 per hectare can sell his milk to the market at a lower price, thus distorting the market. That cannot be allowed to happen. Starting from 2015, we must pay the same hectare premiums for all milk producers in the first pillar. We can expect some interesting discussions. My second comment relates to the market: we need to strengthen the position of producers and processors in relation to the retail sector. I fully support this. We cannot have a situation where milk producers and processors have to pay premiums and listing discounts and payments are delayed by periods of up to 100 days. Commissioner Dalli, we need to step in here to strengthen the position of producers and dairy farmers as a whole. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Albert Deß  (PPE

 Thank you for your question, Mr Bové. I myself am the president of a large dairy cooperative that markets milk for 7 000 dairy farmers and only the dairy farmers themselves have a say in the business, in other words the directors and the members of the supervisory board are all farmers. Unfortunately, we do not have enough leverage in the market to impose our prices on these wholesale chains. What we find particularly disturbing, and what causes prices to drop, are the unfair methods employed by others. There are no net-net prices. Discounts have to be given at the end of the year. Listing fees are demanded in the interim. In other words, it is impossible to compare the prices paid by the retailers because they are undermined by these systems. The Commission should look for clear-cut systems that would make the whole system more transparent and easier to understand. This would also allow us to protect our own interests more effectively.

Blue-card answer.

Mr President, I believe that the present problem is not that we do not have enough milk, but rather that we have too much. The problem is that some farmers are supplying much more than their quota permits. The aim of Ms Lulling and a number of other colleagues is to abolish or reduce the super levy. I disagree with them on this. This provision lasts up to 2015 and a number of dairy producers have spent money in recent months in order to purchase quotas. These people would be penalised if we were now to do away with the entire system. We must provide contractual security. Contractual security means that the status quo must be maintained until 2015, in other words that any force the quota may still have should remain in place until then. We need to consider what market measures we take after 2015. I must say that my dairy cooperative of 7 000 farmers is preparing well for 1 April 2015 and I have also advised dairy farmers to do likewise. Albert Deß  (PPE

Mr President, the subject of compensation payments that we are debating today is a very important one for our farmers in the areas concerned. I would like to point out here that the compensation payments are a success story in European agricultural policy. They have helped the management of the land to continue throughout these areas, where the biodiversity of the cultural landscape has been safeguarded and the jobs of people in these areas have been retained. This has meant that people in these areas continue to have prospects. I therefore find the way that the Commission as well as the Council have dealt with this sensitive matter even more incomprehensible. If we consider these eight biophysical criteria, we see that we will gain new inequities that are significantly worse than those under the current system, in which there are a few delimitation problems. We would have a system that would probably cause a great deal of anger. Details have leaked from Germany indicating that 2.8 million hectares would be removed and 1.2 million new hectares would be included in their place. When I speak to farmers from these areas, they are surprised that they should suddenly be in a Less-Favoured Area. From France, we hear that an area where farmers have the highest average income is to become a less-favoured area. This just does not add up. I would ask the Council whether it is prepared to work with Parliament in the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon so that we can draw up better proposals. Sometimes all I can say, with a certain amount of irony, is: I think as Parliament we need to make a few copies of the Treaty of Lisbon available to the Council and the Commission so that they finally catch on in all areas that this Treaty exists. It appears that many of them are not yet aware of this. Since the whole business really does already resemble a comedy show, as Mr Jahr put it, I would like to make another suggestion. We should declare the area in which the Commission and the Council meet to be a Less-Favoured Area, because they are withholding more than 66% of the information from us. Albert Deß,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to Ms Corazza Bildt and the other Member for the fact that this subject is on the agenda. Not everything is certain, but a hundred years ago we had almost exclusively local production, and products were brought to market in their local area. Today, the situation is quite different. I have here an interesting announcement from the German Federal Ministry of Agriculture, which has discussed precisely what the Commissioner was just saying, namely that it is already possible to entertain regional showcases and regional origin. According to the statement, the Federal Minister for the Economy Ilse Aigner is looking to launch regional labelling in Germany at a Federal/Länder
 summit in April. She says that she is now going to bring forward an initial plan for a new regional showcase for food packaging. The aim would be to put in place clear and transparent labelling for regional products. The labelling is to be voluntary initially, and will aim to make the origin of the product and the most important ingredients transparent. The results of a survey are also interesting. Seventy-nine per cent of consumers are prepared to pay more for regional foods, but only 17% feel reliably informed about the origin of regional foods. Herein lies the major problem, therefore. According to one survey, 83% of respondents in Germany already pay attention to which region a foodstuff comes from. There then follows an interesting statement: according to the Minister, there is no requirement either for a new national legal basis or for notification via the Commission in order to for such a regional showcase to be introduced. In other words, the Member States already have the latitude to act in this way. Nonetheless, the Commission needs to provide greater clarity in this area. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Thank you for your question, Mr Jahr. The reality, Commissioner, is that the Commission, too, needs to consider whether we do not need to lay down other criteria. I had an experience a few years ago, where I had to fight in the Commission in order to help a Bavarian slaughterhouse to survive. What did the Commission official over there have to say about it? He said, ‘Well, it’s no problem if it closes, there’s another slaughterhouse 60 kilometres away in Austria.’ We cannot promote regional products with that mindset. There therefore needs to be a broad-based change of attitude so that regional products, too, can be offered. In addition, we need the Commission to reconsider a few pieces of legislation that play a part in ensuring that this is no longer possible. Albert Deß,

 Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for the current debate in relation to the disease in animals caused by what is being referred to as the Schmallenberg virus. According to scientists, the virus has much in common with the Akabane virus, which has been familiar for some time now in animals from Africa to Japan and Australia. The Akabane virus is harmless to humans, so that it can be assumed that the Schmallenberg virus likewise poses no threat to humans. The virus is a major danger to animals, however, and can cause enormous economic damage. Commissioner, we need to do all we can to halt the spread of this disease and perhaps even to eradicate it. In order to be able to take effective steps, there is an urgent need for mandatory reporting throughout the European Union, something that has already been agreed in Germany at federal level. As we have already heard, the virus is transmitted by biting insects and it is very difficult to protect animals from such sources of infection. Effective protection is actually only possible through the use of an appropriate vaccine. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would call on the Commission to do all in its power to speed up the development of a corresponding vaccine, so that it becomes available as soon as possible. It is also important that the Commission should organise for this data to be recorded quickly, so that the relevant data is available and the necessary measures are implemented. It is also a matter for the Commission to achieve the lifting of the trade restrictions imposed by Russia on 20 March, as already called for. I have heard reports that, as well as Russia, Ukraine, Egypt, Algeria, Mexico and the US have already imposed initial trade restrictions. The faster we act, the sooner we can prevent the further spread of this disease and perhaps even eradicate it. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank Mr Nicholson for this report, which he wrote and on which he also led the negotiations in the trialogue. I would also like to thank all those who helped to bring this compromise about. Commissioner, the direction is the right one, but the impact in the Member States will vary enormously. In Germany, this dairy package will have hardly any impact. We already have producer associations under our Market Structure Act. Many farmers in Germany are organised into cooperatives, which means that they already jointly market their milk and dairy products. Contractual dealings in Germany are regulated by statute. In the private sector, we even already have these supply contracts. Unfortunately, this dairy package will not enable us to solve fundamental problems. This dairy package regulates dealings between producers and dairies. The biggest problem that I see, however, is in the relationship between the dairies and the retailers. This is not some kind of accusation against the parties involved. Nor, as landowners, are we responsible for this, but I ask you, Commissioner, to use your influence in the Commission to ensure that we regulate further issues on the basis of this dairy package, for example the issue of terms of payment for dairy products. It is not acceptable for farmers to deliver products to dairies – fresh milk expires after three days – and for the chain stores to only pay up after 60 or 80 days. Regulation is needed here. A second point is the listing fees, the discounts, that have to be granted here. We need binding net-net prices in the dairy sector so that transparency prevails in the sector. The supply volume rules are not binding, the length of contract with fixed prices between dairies and retail must be regulated. There is thus still much to do. However, my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), will certainly be voting in favour of this dairy package with a large majority. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Bové for his report and Ms Patrão Neves for the initiative for this motion for a resolution today. There are two developments that are worrying me. The first of these, Commissioner, is the growing gap between input and farm gate prices. The second is the situation right throughout the supply chain. Commissioner, I have just looked this up. On 27 July 1961, aged 14, I got my licence to drive a tractor, and my first job was to take grain to the brewery. At that time, 100 kg cost the equivalent of EUR 25. On my way home, I bought a newspaper, which cost me the equivalent of EUR 0.05. Today, cereal costs not EUR 25, but EUR 20, while the newspaper costs EUR 0.70 instead of EUR 0.05. If grain prices had followed the same trajectory as newspaper prices, consumers would now have to pay EUR 350 for 100 kg. You can see from these figures what Europe’s farmers are providing and what contribution they have made to giving our consumers cheap prices for food. What annoys me, and I am personally the chair of a farming cooperative, is the issue of terms of payment. Given the time constraints, I will limit myself to that. It has become a bad habit for the supermarket chains to saddle these farming cooperatives with ever longer payment terms. Once upon a time, it was 24 days. Now, even in Germany, it is often 60. In other words, if we deliver fresh milk, we make 30 deliveries before we get payment for the first one. Commissioner, there is an urgent need for action in this regard. We need to tackle these payment terms in the same way as we tackled roaming charges. That is the only way this situation will be rectified. I beg you to take action. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, Mr Sawicki, ladies and gentlemen, along with several Member States, you, Mr Cioloş, and you, Mr Sawicki, have spoken out in favour of continuing food aid for needy people. As we have heard, a political decision is required to ensure that this takes place. However, the responsibility for this important area lies primarily with the Member States. It is not acceptable that people in Europe do not have enough to eat. It is part of the social responsibility of the Member States to ensure that they do. In Germany there are laws which guarantee sufficient food for all the citizens of the country. The ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union has changed the framework of the current aid programme. Strict limits have been set on market purchases. The Court has determined that the current programme in its current form does not comply with the legal basis of the Treaties. I know that we need to find answers in order to guarantee that the millions of needy people in the EU are given help. However, I would like to stress once again that the socio-political responsibility lies with the Member States. Perhaps we should also consider whether it would be better to establish programmes in the Member States rather than one European programme. These would be cofinanced with social funding from Brussels, in order to guarantee the provision of food aid in all Member States. This would also safeguard European solidarity, which I am firmly committed to, and enable the programmes to be continued. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will certainly help to find solutions for the people who are affected. I was once travelling in Brazil with a group of people when some young Brazilians asked us if they could have the food that we had left on our plates. I was shocked that something like this could happen in a rich agricultural country. We must make sure that people in Europe have enough to eat. Albert Deß,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 50 years ago, in 1961, I began my training to be a farmer. Ever since then, I have been guided by the common European agricultural policy. It has become an important mainstay of the European unification process. Since the beginning of the CAP there have been fundamental changes to its tasks. The first task was to increase food production in order for us to be less dependent on food imports. Sometime later, Europe was in the position of having to deal with food surpluses. With an ever-changing situation, there were also more and more reforms. Today, we are debating the next reform, the new approach of the CAP after 2013. As rapporteur for the CAP reform towards 2020, I am pleased that we have achieved a cross-group compromise. Even if not all of the individual interests could be taken into account in a compromise, the report was adopted with a large majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. The clear vote is an unambiguous signal to the Commission of the form that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development sees the CAP taking towards 2020. I am certain, Commissioner, that the new approach of the CAP after 2013 will also bear the stamp of the European Parliament. The Treaty of Lisbon gives us that possibility. My thanks today go to my fellow Members for their involvement and support, and to the committee chair Mr De Castro, the coordinators and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and willingness to compromise. I would like to thank the staff of the committee secretariat, the political groups and in my own private office for their splendid cooperation. Turning to the report now: food safety and the security of supply for half a billion people remain the main goals of the common agricultural policy, not only in the EU, but also worldwide. The CAP is intended to be sustainable and competitive, to supply consumers with safe, high-quality food and also to promote renewable forms of energy. The two-pillar structure of the CAP is to remain so as to create certainty of planning for our farmers for this next period. The report clearly states – and here we support the Commissioner – that the agricultural budget should remain at the current level in the next financial period. I cannot understand President Barroso’s statement that massive cuts are to be made in the second pillar. I believe that there will be cross-group opposition to this. The simplification of the common agricultural policy remains an important task. That is a core demand of our compromise. We are also calling for a fair distribution among the Member States. That is also necessary in order to create a level playing field in terms of competition. We are seeking to move away from historical and individual references towards area-based premiums. The role of small farmers is to be recognised and, on the basis of subsidiarity, the Member States are to decide themselves how to support these small farmers. The importance of young farmers is mentioned. From my point of view, it was important to avoid introducing a new additional payment system that would lead to extra control and sanction systems for greening. Overall, we have found a compromise that many Members will be able to support tomorrow so that we can send out a clear signal as regards the new approach of this agricultural policy. A large majority of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will support this report. Albert Deß,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank everyone for this intense debate, and also for the support that I have been given here. Commissioner, we are all looking forward to your communication in October and then to good, positive cooperation. European agriculture is a positive factor. It feeds more than 500 million people, farms and looks after more than 170 million hectares of arable land and pasture, it provides many jobs in areas upstream and downstream, is an important buttress of rural areas and is already the most sustainable agricultural sector in the world. I therefore cannot understand why President Barroso has spoken of huge cuts in the second pillar. In so doing he is also jeopardising the EU2020 goals – in other words, his own goals. When 14 million farmers are feeding 500 million people, is it too much to ask that European agricultural policy be used to ensure that the 500 million people also provide properly for the 14 million farmers, so to speak? Here I should like to emphasise – as has been mentioned a couple of times today already – that there have been departures from my original report on some matters. I have been in the political game too long, and I know exactly why I drafted the report as I did. Had I written the report as it stands today, what would I have had to offer in the compromise negotiations? I allowed enough margin to ensure that everyone could be pacified, and a good result has been achieved today. My report therefore had a substantial buffer. The result I wanted to achieve was for us to send a signal as Parliament that we are addressing the important aspects that are necessary if European farmers are to have a good future. Once the legislative proposals are on the table, Commissioner, we will then work intensively to achieve a good outcome together. I can already assure you that you are likely to have greater support here in Parliament than some other commissioners would have. We are able to offer you that. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, back when I was a child, I received letters from what was then Rhodesia. Three of my grandfather’s sisters were Catholic nuns in the then Rhodesia and in South Africa. They never wrote of the people of Rhodesia having to go hungry. What we hear from this country today is simply intolerable. Rhodesia, and later Zimbabwe, were the bread basket of southern Africa. Mr Mugabe – a communist socialist dictator – has managed to turn this bread basket into a famine zone. I would like to thank all the fellow Members who have put this matter back on the agenda. It is intolerable that this dictator, Mr Mugabe, has been allowed to terrorise the people of Zimbabwe for so long. I believe that the key to ending this lies in southern Africa. I regret to say that for as long as South Africa fails to put this dictator in his place, he will continue to terrorise his people. Albert Deß,

 Madam President, Commissioner, thank you Commissioner for the factual presentation of this dioxin scandal in Germany. It makes me extremely angry, including in my capacity as a farmer, that again and again, we have to deal with scandals of this kind where the cause can seemingly be attributed to carelessness, but also to criminal activity. We can put as many laws and regulations in place as we like – in Europe, we have some of the most stringent laws on the production of food and we have the lowest limit values for ingredients that could harm the health of our consumers – but still we are not immune to such dangers. That is why it must also be a requirement – and the Member States are also responsible for this – that if the public prosecutor determines that criminal activity is involved, the magnitude of the penalty must be increased substantially. Such people must not get off with a fine – prison sentences are called for here. They must be put away so that they cannot cause such a disaster again. Commissioner, I am very pleased that you have acknowledged that the German authorities took the appropriate sequence of measures – that was also my impression in Germany. There was a certain amount of political commotion about the matter not being dealt with correctly. We all need to get together and, where necessary, supplement the strict provisions that we have in place. You mentioned one particular matter with regard to which you have our full support. I, too, am in favour – and I am also speaking on behalf of my group – of the introduction of the strict segregation of food production from the production of other products to prevent such mix ups from happening. You have our support, Commissioner, when it comes to improving our provisions and regulations further to enable us to better prevent such scandals in future. Albert Deß,

Madam President, Mr Cioloş, I am pleased that you are here today to answer questions. On 18 May, the European Parliament adopted with a large majority a resolution to simplify the common agricultural policy (CAP). Of course, it has not been possible for you to implement this resolution yet, but I would like to ask you, Mr Cioloş, to take into consideration all the demands made in this motion for a resolution when you begin restructuring agricultural policy. Unfortunately, I have to point out one fly in the ointment. I have just had a discussion with a group of farmers who were concerned that your proposals for the first pillar, Mr Cioloş, would not reduce the amount of red tape, but could instead lead to a huge increase in bureaucracy. The European Union cannot be held responsible for every piece of red tape, Mr Cioloş. A large proportion of the responsibility lies with the Member States. This is why I am asking you to ensure that we can work together on the forthcoming reform so that it is structured in such a way that it can be implemented with as little administrative and supervisory effort as possible. This will allow farmers to focus on their main job, in other words, producing food, rather than requiring them to check the current legislation to find out what they need to be aware of before they do anything out in their fields or their barns. In no other agricultural area in the world are farmers burdened with so many requirements and regulations as in the European Union. You are not yet responsible for this, Mr Cioloş. You have the chance to be the first Commissioner – before you eventually step down, and I do not know when that will happen – who can say that during his period of office, the amount of bureaucracy has been reduced rather than increased. As the rapporteur for agricultural reform, I would like to offer you the opportunity to work together with us to find a solution, so that this goal can be achieved. Albert Deß,

 Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, today’s motion for a resolution will help to set the European livestock sector on the right course. I would like to thank Mrs García for this initiative. The objective of the motion is not to cut Europe off from the rest of the world or to override the rules of the market. Its aim is to put in place fair market conditions for the European livestock industry, which will help to ensure food security for more than 500 million people in future. We must ensure that the European agricultural sector is not confronted with new and highly detailed production regulations on a daily basis and that farmers are not required to provide one certificate of competence after another, while maintaining high animal welfare and environmental standards. Rules of this kind apparently do not apply to imported agricultural products. Therefore, I am grateful to all the 534 Members of this House who voted in Strasbourg in favour of requiring agricultural imports to comply with European consumer protection, animal welfare and environmental protection standards in future. Mr Cioloş, Parliament is ready to give you its full support. These standards must be applied to imports and this is why my group welcomes and supports this motion. Albert Deß  (PPE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all those who worked on this report. Overall, their work has resulted in a good report. During the debate, it has become clear to me that the situation across Europe varies greatly. There are Member States in which a few large concerns dominate the market, and – thankfully – there are also Member States in which there are still many small retailers. There is just as much variation in the situation as regards food prices. There are Member States in which the price of food has risen substantially in recent times, and there are Member States – such as my home country of Germany – where there is merciless competition between enterprises and food prices are constantly being lowered, to the detriment of farmers. Our main concern is to call on the Commission and the Member States to review the situation and to take appropriate measures to allow farmers to add value in the food supply chain. The report also contains some very specific demands, however. I only have time to mention a few here, such as the call in paragraph 30 for a specified payment period. It is not acceptable that farmers, small businesses and cooperatives are providing short-term financing for major concerns. That is the job of the banks; it is not a job for farming cooperatives. Listing fees – as they are known – must also be investigated, Commissioner. We need a uniform regulation on this throughout Europe if we are to ensure competition. If we are to guarantee the food supply of 500 million people in the EU, then we must have fair competition for our farmers in Europe, as called for in the report. There is one more thing I would like to mention, which is that members of my group have asked for certain paragraphs to be voted on separately. As democrats, we have to accept that, but I am assuming that the vast majority of my group will vote in favour of most paragraphs so that we can achieve fair conditions for our farmers. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, today sees an important debate on George Lyon’s report and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Lyon sincerely for the willingness to compromise that he showed in this document. We have managed to reach a good compromise that can be supported by many groups and I am hopeful that this compromise will be supported by a broad majority in the vote to take place at noon today. The common agricultural policy in Europe was and is one of the most important pillars of the European unification process. In this report we describe the effects of the common agricultural policy post 2013. The European agricultural sector produces high-quality food, protects vital rural areas and many jobs, maintains and promotes our cultural landscape and biodiversity and can make a contribution to conserving fossil fuels through the production of renewable raw materials and energy. To ensure that European agriculture can continue to perform these functions into the future, we must find a concept for the period post 2013 that will enable it to fulfil these many tasks. I welcome the fact that Commissioner Cioloş has clearly indicated that he wishes to see a continuation of a two-pillar system. My group will support this. The first pillar acts as a balance to the constraints under which European agriculture operates in relation to other agricultural regions in the world, while the second pillar involves the creation of a catalogue of measures to enable the 27 Member States to ensure that agriculture receives additional aid to enable it to fulfil its functions. The vast majority of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will vote in favour. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, clearly the Mercosur countries are important trading partners for us. However, Commissioner, this trade with the Mercosur countries should not be allowed to become a one-way street. The frequent claims made in public that Europe is closing itself off in the agricultural markets are quite wrong. We purchase over 90% of African agricultural exports and 45% of Central and South American agricultural exports. Europe is certainly not closed off to external trade. What I would criticise, Commissioner, is the information policy pursued. It has not been good. As an agricultural policymaker, I first learned that these negotiations had begun when I opened the newspapers. In future we should not have to rely on the press for our information. I urge you to inform the agricultural sector represented here in Parliament about the progress of negotiations. Another point I would criticise is the fact that the objective here is free trade that is not based on standards. How can it be that we demand high standards of consumer protection, animal protection and environmental protection in Europe, but do not require the same standards from imports? Let me offer just one example in this regard. Last year, Parliament passed the most stringent plant protection product legislation in the world. Many active ingredients are prohibited in Europe. Commissioner, we cannot have a situation in the future where food is supplied to Europe from countries in which active ingredients are used that are prohibited in Europe for reasons of consumer protection. Consumer protection is inviolable and we would do well to remember this in negotiations. Then we have nothing to fear from our competitors, and we European farmers will stand our ground against this competition. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased that the report on specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union has been so amicably discussed in the House. In the last electoral term, I was the shadow rapporteur for reform of the sugar market. At that time, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development visited the island of Réunion where I visited a small agricultural holding that grows sugar cane. Without our support, this small agricultural holding could not stay in existence. As someone from the continental mainland, I also observed that these farmers in the outermost regions of the Union do face a special set of circumstances. It is necessary for us to ensure, through certain rules on exceptions, that we offer these farmers in all these regions that are in the European Union future prospects and ensure that they are able to guarantee food security – at least for the most part – in these areas. It is up to us all to help ensure that agriculture – including through these rules on exceptions – has future prospects and that the security of supply for the local population is safeguarded. The way the report has now been drawn up provides good conditions for achieving these goals. My heartfelt thanks go to all those who have been involved. Albert Deß  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I have voted against the motion for a resolution, because in my opinion, it is lacking some important data. Recently, there has been an increasing number of reports of climate scientists having faked data. It is important for us to discuss this and make our opinions known. In order to ensure that there is no misunderstanding, I would like to explain that I have been committed for many years to reducing our use of fossil fuels and, therefore, our impact on the environment. However, I cannot understand the scaremongering that has been associated with the phrase ‘climate change’. I have experienced a great deal in my long career as a politician. In the early 1980s, people said that there would be no trees left in Germany by 2000, but Germany is greener than it has ever been. It is true that the climate is changing, but this has been happening throughout history and will continue to do so in future. For this reason, I have voted against this motion for a resolution. Albert Deß,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, last year, and this year, too, dairy farmers made their concerns known very loudly, including in Brussels. The impression you get from the media is that it is only the dairy farmers that are in a difficult situation. The fact is that other farming sectors are also affected by this. In contrast to our dairy farmers, the pig producers, pig fatteners, poultry farmers, fruit and vegetable growers, wine growers and even cereal farmers are used to there being good and bad years and therefore do not make their voices heard so loudly. Nevertheless, I think that it is good for us to highlight the situation of these farmers today, too. Commissioner, you said that the financial and economic crisis has affected the whole of the agricultural sector and that we ought to consider how we can respond to this. When talking with the farmers affected on the ground, I hear the same things again and again: by and large, they say they are coping with the markets, apart from situations where it is extremely difficult, like it was last year and is this year for the dairy farmers and others. However, what the farmers do not understand is that we in Europe are burdening them with ever more red tape. They say that they want to work their land and feed and care for their animals rather than spend the whole day keeping books and records about what they are doing. For centuries, our farmers have produced food without keeping vast quantities of records. The yields on the land have increased, the performance of the animals has improved and today, we inundate our farmers with red tape. I have recently read that the agricultural ministers are discussing a reduction in red tape. Our farmers hardly dare believe this anymore. I hope that we can finally make some progress on this and allow our farmers to do what they do best, in other words, produce food – healthy food for half a billion people. We should support them in so doing and ensure that they are able to achieve this in future. Albert Deß,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, Commissioner, it is important for us in the European Parliament to discuss the subject of hunger in the world. We cannot simply sit silently by while the number of people suffering from hunger, which includes many children, increases. I was first elected to a parliament 20 years ago and I can still remember well how international organisations such as the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, the United Nations itself and the World Trade Organisation stated their intention of halving hunger in the world within the next 20 years. What has happened since then? Hunger has not been halved, it has increased. More than 1 billion people suffer from hunger every day. The opposite of what these organisations intended has occurred. There is a wide range of different causes for this. There are countries such as Zimbabwe where an incompetent government has transformed the bread basket of Africa into a famine region. A communist president has brought this rich country to a position where people are suffering from hunger and we say nothing. However, we share the responsibility for this. We spend weeks, if not years, talking about the climate in one hundred years’ time. The people who are suffering from hunger today and tomorrow are not interested in the climate in one hundred years. They want something to eat tomorrow, but we have no answers to their problems. Without wanting to neglect the issues of the future, it is a question of simple humanity to concern ourselves with people who are suffering from hunger today. Mr de Gucht, when we say that we intend to halve hunger by 2050, I find this almost insulting. As a world community, it must be possible for us to reduce the number of people who do not have enough to eat much more quickly. We can transport weapons to every corner of the world, but apparently we are not able to do this with food. This is a failure of the world community, which I would like to denounce. We must find other answers than the ones which we have come up with today. Albert Deß  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, I am grateful to Mrs Herranz García for bringing up this topic today in Parliament. This is a discussion which is fundamental to food policy. I am not interested in shaming Brazil or other countries. The basic question is this: Do we need these strict regulations for European agricultural production in the interests of consumer safety? If the answer is ‘yes’, then this means that consumer protection is regarded as a coherent whole. If the regulations are needed, then the same rules must apply to imports as to our own farmers. The Commission must not allow imports from countries which do not fulfil these requirements. Cattle farmers in Europe must not be punished because one cow in their herd has an ear tag missing, when imports are allowed from cattle herds which do not have a single ear tag. This is not acceptable. If traceability is so important for consumer protection, then it must also apply to imports. If we cannot ensure that this is the case, then it is unfair to our farmers to demand it of them. I have the impression that those people in the Commission who are responsible for imports are applying double standards. As already discussed, I am not interested in partitioning off Europe. I would like to see fair competition for our farmers in Europe so that we can continue to guarantee the food supply of half-a-billion people in future. I can assure you of one thing, Commissioner, and you can pass this on to your successor, Parliament will continue to touch on this sore point. We will not give up until equal competitive conditions have been established. We have good arguments that we can bring up repeatedly to ensure that food security is guaranteed in Europe in future. Albert Deß  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the request to use the urgent procedure put forward by the Commission is certainly not perfect. I can partially agree with what the previous speaker said. However, to not allow this request to use the urgent procedure now would send completely the wrong signals to the dairy farmers, who are expecting at least initial responses. That is why I support this request to use the urgent procedure. In the course of this procedure, we will have the opportunity to improve the motion by means of amendments and, as Mr Häusling suggested, to cede powers. It is absolutely the case that there are possibilities to put a time limit on these powers so that we only give the Commission a power for two years before we then decide on the matter again. I would therefore ask for your support in order to put this request for use of the urgent procedure on the agenda. (Applause) Albert Deß,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome the fact that this request to use the urgent procedure was passed here in Parliament today by a large majority. In this way, we have sent a signal to our dairy farmers and have not shied away from the responsibility. In contrast to a minority of my fellow Members from other groups, we see, in this request to use the urgent procedure, an additional tool to get help to dairy farmers at a difficult time. It is certainly true that this request from the Commission did come very late in the day and that it is less than what is possible. That said, it is always better than doing nothing at all. The views within my own group about the proposed buy-back programme also diverge widely. The programme would have to be obligatory for it to have any impact at all. Yet I see no majority for that in this Parliament or in the Council. Furthermore, such a programme would not be acceptable to some of the Member States as it would be tantamount to a cutting back of the balancing out arrangement and also of the quotas. The indication that quotas are to be raised for priority groups is a decision that is already the law in force. The inclusion of milk and milk products in Article 186 for immediate measures in the event of market disturbances is to be welcomed. Nonetheless, I will be tabling an amendment to the effect that this measure should be restricted to two years. If it proves its worth, we will then agree to an extension. Finally, I would like to say thank you for the EUR 280 million. Commissioner, you have indeed largely accommodated Parliament. I know that you do not have any more money available to you. I ask that the – possibly amended – motion for a resolution be approved on Thursday. Albert Deß,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is, of course, extremely difficult to summarise this problem in two minutes, but I will try to do it in the style of bullet points. The dairy sector is in trouble. Many dairy farmers are seeing their very existence under threat. The main reason for this is a huge drop in milk product sales. The Commission really should have acted more swiftly in this regard. I would also have preferred to see stronger sales promotion measures instead of a greater amount of intervention, such as butter fat being used once again in the ice cream industry. Last year, when the price of butter reached more than EUR 4 for a short time, a large proportion of the ice cream industry stopped processing butter fat. I know the figures for Germany, which show that around 100 000 tonnes is no longer being processed by the food industry, which corresponds to a million tonnes of milk. We must try to stimulate sales once again, in order to clear these quantities from the market. I would like to thank the groups that have helped in drawing up our joint motion for a resolution. Unfortunately, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance did not participate in this discussion. Commissioner, as a short-term measure we are calling for an increase in the de minimis subsidies in an additional motion which is being tabled with 40 signatures, because this would be an opportunity to help the smaller dairy farmers in particular. It would also make sense to introduce an early retirement regulation. I know a lot of farmers who are 58 years old and who would like to stop working soon. An appropriate regulation would be needed for this. Commissioner, I would like to thank you sincerely for your work. I would ask you to put in place appropriate regulations to improve the situation of our dairy farmers. Perhaps you will still have the chance to remedy this situation in the near future.

 I abstained in today’s vote on the ACTA agreement, because I believe that we should wait for the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union on ACTA. The intention is for the Court to carry out a definitive examination of whether the agreement changes existing European law. I have read the agreement myself and I believe that this is not the case. In 2010, the EU seized 103 million products at its external borders that were most probably counterfeit products. For the first time the estimated value of the equivalent genuine products was also quoted, this being more than EUR 1 billion. In view of these incredible figures, I believe that we urgently need to work even more intensively to combat product piracy in order to safeguard the competitiveness of our European industry. A global agreement on the protection of intellectual property is therefore essential. Angelika Niebler,

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I assume that each of you here in plenary has a smartphone and that you use them all the time, wherever you are – whether you are out and about at home, in your own country, or in Europe, whether you are on holiday or on business. We here in Parliament are by no means exceptional; our citizens are also permanently mobile and on the move in Europe. Our young people, in particular, are constantly online nowadays. That is why I am particularly pleased that tomorrow, we will be able to adopt the Roaming III Regulation, as it is known, which will enter into force on 1 July 2012. In other words, just in time for the holiday season, we will be able to give our citizens the benefit of lower tariffs when they use smartphones in Europe. The future belongs to mobile devices. These days, everyone is mobile 24 hours a day. In recent years, there has been a huge increase in data transfer via smartphones in particular, and we will see further huge increases in the years ahead. In contrast, the costs of using a mobile phone abroad are still extremely high; indeed, they have hardly come down at all. That is unacceptable. The charges must reflect reality. We cannot allow people using smartphones at home or in another European country to be charged many times what they have to pay at home for making calls, sending or receiving texts or downloading data. I can tell you that I am with a German provider, and at the beginning of this week, my provider informed me that I will have to pay EUR 8.20 if I download one megabyte of data here in Brussels. That is a complete rip-off, and we cannot allow it to continue. What, then, will the new Roaming Regulation do? Its main aim is reduced charges for all our citizens. We hope to achieve this by creating greater competition in the roaming market in future. We are introducing maximum charges, and one particularly new element is a maximum retail charge for data transfer. The first maximum retail charge will take effect on 1 July 2012. In future, one megabyte will cost no more than EUR 0.70. The charges will be lowered further from 1 July 2013, when a maximum retail charge of EUR 0.45 per megabyte will come into force. The third price reduction will take effect on 1 July 2014, when the maximum charge will become EUR 0.20 per megabyte. We had to fight hard for these maximum retail charges in tough negotiations with the Council. I would like to extend my great thanks to my shadow rapporteurs and, in particular, to the rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, Robert Goebbels. Had we not fought so hard for better charges, then we would not be today where we hope to be after 1 July. The market will also be opened up to new providers without a network of their own, in what is known as an open access solution. Moreover, from 1 July 2014, consumers will be able to choose roaming services from providers other than their national provider. This proposed solution is known as unbundling and, in future, European customers will also be able to use local services when travelling abroad – known as local break-out – by being able to choose the best offer from the various local operators, as is already the case for WLan access. We have also introduced consumer protection rules. In future, these will apply not just within Europe, but also outside the European Union. The obligation to send a warning when users reach a certain tariff level, a certain level of charges, will also apply abroad. Other consumer protection rules have also been introduced in order to prevent involuntary roaming. All in all, I can say that today is a good day for our citizens of Europe. I am pleased that from 1 July, charges will be reasonable, even for roaming. (Applause) Angelika Niebler,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Ms Kroes, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank everyone very much for the many appreciative comments. I am very pleased, because I have never before received so much praise in Parliament. However, I would also like to express my gratitude and, most importantly, to return the thanks of all the Members of this Parliament who have given me such strong support during the debates. Of course, I would like to thank the Danish Presidency and the Commission once again for their excellent cooperation. It is true that we have a European internal market and a Single Euro Payments Area. I believe that our objective must be to establish a single European communication area, as many Members have already said in the course of this debate. Creating a roaming-free area in Europe must be our ultimate goal. I very much hope that we will be able to achieve this in the near future. I also hope, Ms Kroes, that we do not need a Roaming IV Regulation, as Mr Rübig has suggested. I hope, as a result of the structural measures and the competition which will now develop, that one provider will make a bold move and stop charging for roaming altogether. I hope that this will happen before the revision and before you submit a report here in 2016. I hope that the competitive market functions in such a way that the subject of roaming finally becomes a thing of the past. I would like to pass on my warm thanks. I am looking forward to the vote tomorrow and I hope that Parliament will give the report substantial support. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, who also so successfully put across Parliament’s position in the negotiations with the Council. ‘Spectrum Gunnar’, you have my thanks! More and more European citizens make use of mobile Internet services, and the trend is upwards. I have a couple more figures to highlight this. In 2010 alone, average monthly smartphone usage doubled to 79 MB from 35 MB the previous year. Similarly, in 2010 3 million new tablets – such as the iPad – were newly connected to the mobile network. In future, too, even greater data traffic is anticipated. Experts predict that mobile data traffic will increase by a factor of 26 between 2010 and 2015, and in 2015 some 788 million people will use the Internet exclusively from mobile devices. Against this backdrop, the first European radio spectrum policy programme, which we will be deciding on tomorrow, therefore has a particular role to play. Our goal is clear – more frequencies need to be made available for wireless broadband networks in future than has been the case so far. The flood of data was threatening to block up the transmission capacities that we have hitherto had available. More frequencies will mean that we can continue to use our mobile Internet services without interruption in future. If we adopt the radio spectrum policy programme tomorrow with a broad majority, we will have done something positive for our citizens in Europe. As you all know, I am currently also fighting on another front, as rapporteur for the new Roaming Regulation, to bring about better conditions for mobile Internet use. I believe that surfing the net when abroad must become much cheaper. Commissioner, you have already brought forward a bold proposal in this regard. We also aim to be somewhat bolder in Parliament, as we want to achieve something for our European consumers. If the Roaming Dossier – as is my hope – can be wrapped up in the first half of this year I would be very pleased if I earned the nickname ‘Roaming Angelika’. Angelika Niebler  (PPE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure we all agree that our objective is an open, fair Internet. That has already been mentioned by many fellow Members. We need this not only for our citizens, for users of the network and for the economy – the Commission mentioned this – but we also need it for our policies and for democratisation processes. I need only remind you of the Arab Spring. We would not have been able to find out about many of the developments in the North African states and in the Middle East if it had not been for the Internet. How will we achieve this? I would like to refer to what Mr van Nistelrooij said. The Netherlands has gone ahead with a regulation on net neutrality. That is – please forgive me, Mr van Nistelrooij – the wrong approach to take. I think it is important for us to take a genuine European approach here, for us not to propose 27 separate regulations in this regard, but at least in Europe to seek to take a unified, harmonised approach to this issue. Therefore, I would, above all, ask the Commission, after careful analysis of the facts and with the involvement of BEREC and the national regulators, to present a proposal as quickly as possible. In one sub-area – roaming – we are currently having this debate. Structural changes are already underway in this area in connection with switching operators. I believe that this is the right course to take. Perhaps we do not need any horizontal regulation of net neutrality at all. Roaming provides a good example here. I would like to make one final point. As I see it, the most important thing for our citizens at home is that there should be no misleading advertising in respect of fast transmission rates. Many providers entice customers with offers that promise extremely fast data transmission speeds. However, these offers can only be exploited at three o’clock on the morning. At other times, the transmission rates do not reach anywhere near the speeds frequently promised in the advertisements. I would be grateful – to you, too, Ms Gaj – if you could check once again with BEREC and get back to us as to whether the subject of ‘no misleading advertising in respect of fast transmission rates’ is also being addressed.

 Firstly, I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, who has succeeded over months of tough negotiations in drafting a report on the subject of women and business leadership which, to a large extent, is very balanced and deserves our support. I would like to explain briefly why I voted against paragraph 1 and paragraph 16b. The figures on the proportion of women in management positions are shameful. Therefore, I am fully convinced that we finally need to take targeted measures to bring about a significant increase in this proportion. However, I feel that the calls made in paragraph 1 and paragraph 16b go too far. I do not believe that we should intervene in the operational management of businesses or set quotas even for the board of directors. Therefore, we should first of all call on companies to take voluntary measures. In particular, I think that 2012 is far too early for the introduction of legislative provisions and quotas. However, in order to send out a clear political signal that something needs to be done urgently and, at the same time, to support the efforts made by Mrs Kroes, I have voted in favour of the resolution as a whole. Angelika Niebler  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we definitely need more women in the top executive suites of companies throughout the European Union. You all know the statistics. Only one in ten board members in the European Union are women; 97% of board members are men. I think that we all agree that action is urgently needed. I should like to thank the Commissioner. Commissioner, it was you who took the bold step in March and called for action. You called on companies to take voluntary action. If they do not, you will table a legislative proposal, a legal basis, in March 2012. Thank you so much. The figures that we have seen in the meantime illustrate that something has already been done. If you had not been so bold, Mrs Reding, we would not have made these small steps. I should also like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, for her excellent draft. I agree with many of the statements in this draft. I shall support the draft, even though I take a different view of the quota as it now stands in the report. I take the view that, if self-regulation does nothing to help, a statutory quota is needed in order to put pressure on companies. However, I also take the view that we should start by introducing this quota for the supervisory structures of large companies, not for the operational side of businesses. I shall not therefore support the proposal in paragraph 16(b); however, I shall vote in favour of the report, because it says the right things. How women stand on the quota is a question of their own self-image. I would have no problem in using a quota to open the door. Whether or not I am good at my job is something that I still have to prove, regardless of how I get there. In that respect, a quota helps, but it is no substitute for performance. No woman has a problem with a door being held open. You have to walk through and prove yourself. Women in the European Union also need to be given an opportunity to walk through.

 Madam President, I would like to ask you, Mrs Harms, why you have not thanked Mr Oettinger. Why did you not say thank you? I think the accusations that you have made against him here are outrageous. Mr Oettinger was the only person who made the most of the opportunity to bring together everyone involved immediately after Fukushima and to insist that we carry out stress tests at a European level, regardless of the responsibilities. Now we have a result that goes far beyond the tests carried out over the last 15 or 20 years, with European involvement and with peer reviews by teams that have been put together at a European level. I believe it is unfair for you to continue following your own green policy without taking any responsibility. Angelika Niebler,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mrs Reding, ladies and gentlemen, let me perhaps introduce the topic with a few examples. Greece and other states are heavily in debt, although billions from the structural funds have been poured into these countries for many years. How can we improve the use of these resources and how can the utilisation of these resources be better controlled? My second example relates to Eurobonds. What effect do they have on the European budget? Thirdly, if we were to introduce a financial transaction tax in Europe, what would the consequences be? For all these questions, Parliament demands in its reports that a regulatory impact assessment be carried out. After all, we need facts in order to be able to take politically sound decisions. That is what my report on improving the guarantee of independent impact assessments is all about. This is not a new issue. It has occupied us, together with other issues concerning the improvement of legislation, for over ten years. However, despite all the efforts of the Commission to improve its impact assessment as well as those that we have made in this regard in the European Parliament, the quality of the impact assessment is still in need of improvement. My report puts forward proposals for how, with regard to the European Commission and the impact assessments that it carries out, as well as with regard to Parliament’s impact assessment studies, we can succeed in bringing about this improvement. In terms of its content, the report is divided into four sections. Firstly, there are general requirements for impact assessments at European level. The second section contains proposals directed at the European Commission and it lists potential areas where improvements can be made. In the third section, I discuss how we in the European Parliament can better optimise the regulatory impact assessment as an instrument. In the last section, I then propose that we in Parliament create an autonomous impact assessment structure. With regard to the general requirements for impact assessments at European level, it is important to note that we need to move away from pure cost analysis towards an examination of the economic, social and health-related impact of legislation at European level. Secondly, I think it is important that we carry out an SME test in connection with all regulatory impact assessments and also examine the effect on industrial competitiveness in Europe. Thirdly, in this report, we propose the early publication by the Commission of road maps of proposed legislation in order to give Parliament and the stakeholders the opportunity to express their opinions during the consultation period. With regard to the European Commission, we call, in particular, for the members of the Impact Assessment Board that was set up a while ago in the Commission to be independent and for the parliamentary committees to be involved in the work at an early stage. With regard to Parliament, we believe it is important for us actually to utilise the regulatory impact assessment as an instrument. Up to now, a few committees have been using it, but I think we need to make much more extensive use of this instrument in our discussions in Parliament. If we succeed in developing Parliament’s own resources and establishing an autonomous structure under the leadership of Members of this House in order to develop a method that allows us to carry out professional regulatory impact assessments within the European Parliament, then I believe we will have achieved a great deal with this report. I hope it will receive your support tomorrow in the vote. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Mr President, I apologise for taking the floor once again, but I believe that some confusion has arisen, because my fellow Members are not currently discussing my report, but the report on social responsibility, which will be debated later. Perhaps we could first finish the debate on the subject of the impact assessment – I believe Mr Baldassarre had asked to speak on the subject of my report – and then we can move on to the next report. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe 2020 strategy – to be honest, I do not feel like discussing the Europe 2020 strategy at all. Ten years ago, we adopted a strategy, the Lisbon Strategy. When you now look back at this past decade, the results are limited, if I may put it in those modest terms. I think that we should currently be focusing on what really matters to people at home in our Member States, rather than making the same mistake again. They are wondering whether we will be able to ensure the stability of our currency. Will there be inflation? What lessons do we need to learn from the developments over the last two years, from the financial and economic crisis, and now from the currency crisis? Are we really taking to task the players in the financial markets who have contributed to the crisis? I would emphatically call on the Commission, first and foremost, to take steps to ensure rapid financial market regulation and progress in Europe in order to prevent, as has been the case in recent years, money being sent around the globe five times in the same day and many people making a profit on this while losses are being nationalised. I would ask the Commission to demand that Member States exercise strict budgetary discipline and implement appropriate rules. I would also ask for the earliest possible tightening of the Stability and Growth Pact. This is where we should be focusing our efforts. I urge the Commission to take requisite measures, but not as before, off its own bat or by discussing them thoroughly with Member States. Instead, it should finally take Parliament seriously as an equal legislator alongside the 27 Members States. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, over recent months, the conditions for the people, as well as the overall political and economic situation, have dramatically deteriorated in Yemen. We Europeans must therefore do everything we can to finally stabilise the country. High Representative, might I ask you to please prevent Yemen from becoming a second Afghanistan. We must do everything in our power to fight international terrorism. We will only be able to achieve that, however, if we also support a peace process in Yemen. We need to achieve peace in the region and we need to support the peace efforts of the government there. The Yemeni Government could also be reminded, once again, that it needs to ensure that there is no discrimination in Yemen – only then can there be peace. Peace requires democratic structures that uphold the rights of minorities. That is our European path, and it may differ from other paths. I ask you, in your new role, to spare no efforts to walk this European path with us. Without political stability, Yemen has no chance. With political stability, the local economy can recover, then an economy can be built up and people can be given future prospects. I ask you to work hard for this. I also ask you to make your influence count to ensure that the auxiliary troops there can provide humanitarian assistance. There are over 130 000 refugees from Somalia in Yemen. The situation on the ground is dreadful. I put all my hopes on you, Baroness Ashton, in the expectation that you will use your influence here. Please also stand up for the six hostages, for the European citizens – one Briton and five Germans – who are being held as hostages in Yemen. Maybe you can also help to get them freed. Many thanks.

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you will all be familiar with Google, the internet search engine. You will probably also know about the new Google Books Project, which everyone has been discussing over the last few months. The aim of the project is to scan in books from libraries and make them available over the internet, so that readers have quick and easy access to a large number of works on the web. From the perspective of readers and internet users, this is a wonderful idea. However, what does it mean for authors, creative people, artists and publishers? What part will they play in the publication of their work on the web? We must look closely at these questions over the next few months. You may already be aware that publishers and authors in the US have initiated legal proceedings against Google with regard to the scanning and publication of works on the web. As far as I know, the legal dispute has been resolved and the parties have settled out of court. However, the questions remain unanswered and they relate not only to the situation with Google, because there are certain to be similar cases in future. We must deal with these questions as quickly as possible. Does copyright need to be adapted in the digital age? Do we need to change existing structures? In this respect, I am thinking particularly of the role of the collecting societies, which we have often discussed in Parliament. Are new monopolies being created on the web? How should we react to this? How will this change the structures in our countries, for example, with regard to the bookshops in the regions? What are the opposing interests in this case and how can we find a suitable balance between them? Authors and publishers want to receive a financial reward for their work. This also applies, of course, when their works are made available on the internet. Libraries want to put their archives on the web without having to sign a licence agreement with every copyright holder first. The interests of consumers are clear. They would very much like to have quick and easy access to the content on the web. We have not yet reached the point of being able to discuss possible solutions, but we need to ask ourselves a lot of questions and that is the purpose of the written question submitted to the Commission by the Committee on Legal Affairs. Do we need to make distinctions in order to resolve the copyright issues, for example, with regard to content? If so, what distinctions should be made? The Commission seems to be moving in this direction, as it is first of all focusing on the situation of the library stocks. Should there be a process of mass digitisation in future, or is our existing licensing system sufficient to resolve the problem? How can copyright clearance be simplified in the internet age? As you know, copyright is primarily a national right and in this respect, we must once again ask ourselves: is this still an up-to-date approach? How should we deal with orphan works in future, in other words, books whose copyright holder cannot be identified or located? Should we perhaps distinguish between literary works and scientific or academic works? For example, the authors of novels earn their living from the publication of their books, but when scientists make their papers available on the web, they are primarily interested in making a name for themselves in their field of research and are less reliant on the money that their work earns. There are numerous questions that we need to ask ourselves and I am pleased to be able to discuss them with you. I would like to consider one last important point and that is once again the subject of collecting societies. Look at how easy it is nowadays to download music from the internet. You simply go to iTunes and buy songs for 20, 30, 40 or 50 cents. What are the implications for the collecting societies? Do we still need them? I would be pleased if the Commission could once again give us an idea of what the current situation is. In Parliament, we have been asking the Commission for years to take a look at the collecting societies. To put it rather imprecisely, these are also monopolistic bodies, which have been established over a period of decades. I am interested to know what the Commission is planning. My final point is that if you take a platform like Google, which makes everything freely available, this will result in a monopoly being created on the web. We need to consider how the situation should be handled in order to ensure that we do not end up with just one supplier, who then decides on the conditions for access to content on the web. I am looking forward to a debate with you over the next few weeks and months and I will be interested to hear the Commission’s response to the first question from the Committee on Legal Affairs. Angelika Niebler  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I have three points to make. The first is that the car industry is a key industry for Europe and – this has already been said – when you include all the upstream and downstream businesses and the whole supply industry, 12 million jobs depend on it. I just want to emphasise this one more time as Mr Chatzimarkakis is sitting there in front of me, having just said that the German Government’s efforts were electioneering bluster. I can only refute this definitively. It is a mocking affront to the workers employed in this sector across numerous European countries who have to fear for their jobs day in and day out. Secondly, rescuing Opel is in the common interests of Europe as a whole. I think it is particularly important to stress this, irrespective of the debate today. There are sites in the UK, Belgium, Poland, Spain, Germany and other European countries. If Opel is rescued by the fact that there is an investor, namely Magna, that there are bridging loans, for which the German Government fought, it is not only in Germany’s interests but those of Europe as a whole. We must all take steps to retain jobs in our home countries. I am pleased. Where would we be today if we had not taken steps to bring about the trusteeship solution? There would not be any need for further debate today in that case, as the debate would have been done and dusted in any case when General Motors drew GM Europe along with it into the mess surrounding its insolvency. My third point is that there are strict rules for State aid. I am confident that the Commission will examine this matter in a proper manner doing justice to the interests involved. The crucial question will be whether Opel Europe can be profitable again in the medium term. I am confident that the solution that has now been produced and on which Magna, too, is working, and which involves many other European States, can be implemented. I ask the Commission to also provide the relevant authorisation and I would like to conclude by re-stating that, in this case, we have achieved something positive for the car industry in Europe as a whole! Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Ms McAvan, warmly for her excellent work once again. Good pharmacovigilance protects the citizens of Europe. At the same time, we are also bolstering informed patients. It was therefore very important to close the safety loopholes exposed and actually opened up by the Mediator case as soon as possible. From now on, a company that removes a medicinal product from the market must state the reasons why it is doing so. The other Member States will also be informed via the European Medicines Agency – something that is irremissible for the protection of patients in Europe’s internal market, too. There is one point that is particularly close to my heart, which is the better readability of package inserts. Many patients really do complain about the complexity of package inserts. They say they are too difficult, too hard to understand, too unreadable, too confusing. This is a subject that the older elements of the population in particular bring up, although it is not only them. Some patients are even so scared by the side effects when trying to find important information that, in the end, they do not even take the medicine. Together with Mr Liese, I therefore advocated the idea that the package insert should be made more readable for patients and that a drug facts box containing the most important information, including the side effects, should be included on the package insert, written in plain language and given graphic emphasis. I am very pleased about the result obtained from the negotiations, and about the fact that the Commission, Commissioner Dalli, has also promised to produce a report on better readability. I hope that the Commission will keep its promise and also that it does so as soon as possible. I would be interested to hear – and I am happy to take the opportunity presented by the presence of Commissioner Dalli with us here today – whether there are already specific ideas in this regard at this point. I would be really interested to hear the answer to that question. I would like to offer my thanks to the Commission for having tackled this issue, as it really does represent a major step towards patient friendliness if we can improve the package insert and make it more readable.

Blue-card question.

 I have a question for Ms Girling. She has just stated that the rules for gluten intolerance will not be of any further help. I believe that it is very important to protect these people because intolerance sufferers require this strict diet. If we fail to include them in the high protection standards of this regulation, instead depending solely on food labelling, then the necessary level of protection is not assured. It is for this reason that I strongly support this resolution and would like to ask Ms Girling why she believes this is not the case. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
).  
– (DE) 
Mr President, the average consumer has complete freedom to choose products in the supermarket and to consume them afterwards. The provisions of the Food Labelling Regulation are sufficient for this. Certain groups, such as infants and small children, require particular protection when it comes to composition and labelling, however. As a mother of a one-year-old daughter who breast-fed her child for seven months, I am very pleased that milk replacement products can no longer be advertised with euphemistic images suggesting that these products might even be better than breast milk. I also welcome the fact that follow-on milk is once again to be examined, as I also decided against using this milk. It tastes sweet and actually encourages the child to prefer such products, so that in the future it will not drink conventional milk. People who suffer from gluten intolerance need special foods if they are to avoid serious complications, such as bowel cancer. It is for this reason that I also believe it important to maintain a high standard of protection here. This is only possible by incorporating gluten intolerance in the regulation. This includes, for example, provisions requiring that the foods for these patients should provide the same amount of vitamins and minerals as the foods they replace. It is vital that this protection standard is maintained. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
),

 I can only agree that we should put an end to the wastage of food. The figures are alarming: 60% of food waste in European households could be avoided. The Commission has come to the conclusion that a fifth of the food is thrown away because ‘best before’ dates are not used correctly. I can therefore only support the call for 2013 to be declared the European Year against Food Waste, with information and educational initiatives. We need citizens to be more aware, right from childhood onwards. We need to explain to our citizens what the ‘best before’ date means. The ‘best before’ date is not an expiry date. Consumers should use it only as a guide. The ‘use by’ date for perishable goods is different. These products should not be consumed after such a date. We all have a responsibility to prevent food waste across Europe and to create greater understanding. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
),

 In the European Parliament, we have been fighting for safe, high-quality foodstuffs for many years. The text that we have voted on today provides anything but this, as it waters down the current standards for the quality of fruit juices in Europe. Therefore, I was unable to vote in favour of the compromise package today. However, I would also like to express my criticism of the negotiation process. It is unacceptable for the opinion of the lead committee to be disregarded to a large extent in the compromise package. The European Parliament fought long and hard to be given equal legislative powers. We must also exercise this responsibility in the negotiations for the good of the citizens of Europe. In the interests of these citizens, I would have liked the result of the vote to have been different today. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, today’s vote in the European Parliament aimed at combating Internet pornography is pioneering the protection of our children. We will have more protection for the victims and better prevention. The measures adopted will enable better prevention of all abuse of children, in particular the growing phenomenon of child pornography on the Internet. National laws are not enough to combat child Internet pornography. Here the European Union offers us an opportunity to stamp out these grievous activities on a Europe-wide basis. As a young mother, it is a particular concern and very important for me that pornographic material involving children should be taken down off the Internet immediately. I therefore welcome the decision to prescribe the deletion of such material as the ideal solution. The new regulations also provide a greater level of protection for the victims throughout Europe through higher, more stringent penalties for the perpetrators. I fully support the comprehensive approach taken by the directive. The legal framework is every bit as important as information and prevention measures. This law puts us on the right path for protecting the youngest members of our society. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

 I would like to thank Mrs Sommer, the rapporteur, for her excellent work over the last four years. Today’s vote in the European Parliament is groundbreaking. It brings more clarity and openness for consumers. The model I have in mind is that of responsible consumers who are aware of what they are buying. However, that will only be the case when they also know what a product contains. Today’s decision will introduce standardised, mandatory nutrition labelling relating to per 100 g/100 ml amounts, thereby allowing consumers to compare products on the supermarket shelves. All the existing food labelling is voluntary, sometimes confusing and difficult to compare. Mandatory labelling which shows the nutritional value of foods will give consumers the information they need to make informed purchasing decisions. Consumers are increasingly being misled or deceived about food. We only need to think of imitation cheese on pizza, reconstituted ham, ice cream that contains no milk and chocolate biscuits without chocolate. Often, cheap substitutes or aromas are used. All these imitation products must, in future, be labelled as such. The food labelling regulation is a major success on behalf of European consumers, which is why I have supported it. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, I am not convinced with regard to all of the points of the compromise, but I know that the new regulation represents a definite improvement on the current legal situation. First of all, we will get a standardised European technical language for the performance of construction products and streamlined and simplified procedures. We have made progress with the European internal market and, in so doing, we have benefited the companies and also, through standardised safety requirements, the consumers, too. In principle, I regard relief from bureaucratic regulations for micro-enterprises to be important and sensible. However, we also need to take account of the fact that micro-enterprises that process construction products are also users and must also be protected. I am therefore pleased that my proposal was included in the compromise. This provides for simplified procedures for micro-enterprises in connection with the evaluation of the performance characteristics of construction products. However, if they apply such a procedure, they must prove the equivalence of the procedure used with the procedure that is actually provided for throughout Europe. This is the only way to ensure that the details of the performance characteristics are also accurate and reliable and that the safety of buildings is also ensured throughout Europe. Anja Weisgerber,

 Mr President, Commissioner Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, those who helped produce this report and everyone who contributed to this splendid result. Without the constructive and very open collaboration with both the Commission and with the Belgian Presidency of the Council, it would not be possible to conclude this package tomorrow. As I am sure you can imagine, I am very satisfied with this result. The repeal of a total of eight outdated and obsolete directives will enable us to take another step in the direction of less bureaucracy in Europe. What is interesting in said directives is that they largely became obsolete because they have already been replaced by international standards that represent the latest state of the art. Member State rules and regulations are often rendered obsolete by harmonised European rules and regulations, after all. In this case, European rules and regulations have become superfluous thanks to international stipulations. If we want to make progress towards our target of having 25% less bureaucracy in Europe by 2012, we need to nail our colours to the mast now. To put it in the words of the Chair of the High Level Group of Independent Stakeholders on Administrative Burdens, Edmund Stoiber, we in Europe must not only purse our lips, we need to whistle loudly. In other words, our words must be followed up by tangible action. When it comes to that action, the devil is often in the detail, however. This directive repealing eight directives relating to metrology has shown this clearly once again. Measuring instruments for cold water meters for non-clean water, alcohol meters, certain weights, tyre pressure gauges and equipment to measure the standard mass of grain or the size of ship tanks have been replaced, in practice, by more modern digital equipment. The outdated equipment is used increasingly rarely and the rules governing such equipment can thus be abolished. There are also no consequences for the functioning of the internal market or for the high standard of consumer protection, which remains of great importance to us. Yet the Council has been blocking this package for some time. We have managed, however, to reach a reasonable compromise between the Council and Parliament in the informal trialogue, and even to do so at first reading – which is always the exception rather than the rule for us. The substance of that agreement is as follows: one directive – namely that concerning the calibration of ship tanks – is to be repealed immediately, which is to say, with effect from 1 July 2011, while the remaining seven directives will be repealed once the recast version of the Framework Measuring Instruments Directive (MID), which the Commission is currently working on, has been adopted. The Commission will produce a new proposal for the MID by the end of April 2011. The idea is that the Commission, when reviewing the MID, will also examine whether and, if so, what elements from the old directives should be retained and should therefore be incorporated into the MID to that end. If the Member States provide evidence that certain elements within the seven directives are still necessary, for example, on consumer protection grounds, such as provisions from the directive relating to tyre pressure gauges for motor vehicles, these sections will be incorporated into the Framework Measuring Instruments Directive. Once the recast version of the MID has been adopted, the remaining directives will be repealed. This is a signal that Europe is serious about cutting red tape and that we are eager to create the conditions for sustainable economic growth. I am proud of the fact that the European Parliament is doing its bit, in this way, to help cut red tape and to produce better, more streamlined and simpler lawmaking. Allow me just to conclude with a brief word about the correlation tables. These are the tables that the Member States are supposed to draw up in order to document how they have implemented the directive. In the end, we agreed on a less strict wording in this regard. We fought for stricter wordings in future, however, and we achieved our goal in this regard. The Conference of Presidents will champion this cause accordingly to the Council and the Commission. This represents a success that we have the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs to thank for. Anja Weisgerber, 
 rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow Members, including my appreciation of their valuable contributions to the debate tonight. After the vote in the morning, we need to shift our focus to the future. Naturally, we are looking forward to seeing how the individual rules and regulations turn out – the Commission has now announced that it will table its proposal for the Measuring Instruments Directive (MID) by the end of April. It will then also be possible to check whether any of the individual legislative regimes that we are removing from circulation are to be incorporated. It is important, as Mrs Comi also said, that no legal vacuum arises. Mrs Gebhardt, I can tell you that that was also a very important concern for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and it was one that we were able to follow up on. For me, however, it is also important to mention that the Member States are required to document even more strictly why certain aspects or elements should be retained, as it is only in those circumstances that we really need European regulations; they are not an end in themselves. I am also looking forward to the Internet consultation that the Commission has announced and which will take place between 6 September and 1 November 2011. The consultation will also involve the companies affected, the authorities and so forth. Once again, I will be listening closely to businesses. When it comes to the existing directive, too, I checked whether these measuring instruments were still in use and, as it happened, the response every single time – for example, from my wine growing association, which I asked about alcohol meters – was that such items of equipment certainly are not used any longer. We therefore need to look very closely into this. If we really do want to make progress towards this target of cutting red tape in Europe by 25% by 2012 – and that, of course, is no longer very far away – we need to make major progress in this area. We, as Parliament, are ready to play a part. Finally, I just have one more thing to say about the correlation tables. I want to state, at this point, that, once again, what we have here is a compromise, but, with regard to the future, I would like to call on the Member States to commit to actually drawing up these tables because this really is about a uniform implementation of the rules and regulations throughout Europe.

 Mr President, in relation to the adoption of the Toys Directive, I would like to point out that, when we adopted the directive, we had an objective in mind, namely, making children’s toys safer, as children, in particular, still growing and developing as they are, have a particularly sensitive reaction to hazardous substances and chemicals. Considering the most up-to-date scientific knowledge at that point, we laid down the strictest requirements anywhere in the world for toys through European legislation. As every year, this issue comes to the fore in the run-up to Christmas, and for me personally, too, as a mother-to-be, this issue is one that is close to my heart, and I think it is very important that we have the strictest standards. That is why I helped initiate this debate. I did so in the light of new expert opinions that have concluded that the strictest limit values for heavy metals are not strict enough, given the latest scientific knowledge. We included a clause in the directive specifically for cases like this, which makes it possible to modify and tighten up the limit values at a later date, and we now need to make use of that clause. Commissioner Tajani, that was something that we also called on your predecessor to do a year ago. I am pleased that, as I understand it, the Commission is to announce today, at least, that the limit values for certain heavy metals are to be tightened up, albeit with a delay from when we called on it to do so and certainly encouraged by the debate today. In general, however, we need to review all hazardous substances, and we should not, therefore, restrict ourselves to the heavy metals. Instead, we need to look into the latest information on the hazardous substances known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Should it also turn out that it is necessary to amend the limit values in order to protect our children, I call for a rectification of the legislation in this regard, too. At the end of the day, this is about the safety of our children. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Christofer Fjellner, and his shadow rapporteurs. Under difficult conditions, and despite battling against a severe headwind, a very good result has genuinely been achieved with this report. The Commission proposal has been improved considerably. A strict ban on advertising remains: there will be no information on the radio, television or in magazines; instead, patients must actively seek out the information. I base my position on the idea that patients are responsible people. They want to be informed, and I would very much like to help them achieve that. I therefore also want the patient to be at the centre of the information. I would like to focus on two key points. I myself have said in no uncertain terms – including in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – that I would like to see health portals on the Internet and similar information in printed media. Our citizens often look things up on the Internet, where they often come across poor and uncontrolled information. We must therefore counter this with an alternative: controlled information. Pharmacovigilance was a first success, with the adoption of drug safety portals that included the package leaflets and information on the medicines. However, I would like to go beyond this, Commissioner, and would have liked to have seen comprehensive Internet portals that also provide information on illnesses and prevention. If I have understood you correctly, you support this in principle, but perhaps have not said so in this dossier. I would like the Commissioner to make a clear statement as to whether he also supports this. I consider this to be a very, very important matter. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

Madam President, our heartfelt thanks go to the rapporteur. The directive on electrical and electronic equipment is highly controversial. There were great differences of opinion regarding various aspects. I am therefore pleased that agreement has been reached and at what I regard as the good result of the trialogue negotiations. I would specifically like to reiterate two points. One is the question of the scope. What equipment should the directive actually cover? There is one thing that we must not forget: originally, it was meant to cover domestic appliances – in other words, white goods. The open scope now includes many new product groups, which would also have encompassed technologies for renewable energy. I must point out that this directive actually had a quite different objective. Naturally, much stricter and higher standards of protection need to be applied in the case of domestic appliances than in the case of technologies such as those that are uninstalled, recycled, etc. by specialist personnel. That is why I, in turn, advocated the exemption of renewable energies. I was not in favour of expanding the scope, but then I saw that a majority was moving in that direction. I think it would have been counterproductive to include renewable energy in this directive. It would have resulted in a competitive disadvantage and therefore I think it is the right decision. Then I would like to say something about Annex III: I would have had concerns about including a further 37 substances as priority substances when there is no real justification on health grounds for a future ban on these. I think that would be a panic measure, and that is why I think the decision made is the right one and am pleased about this aspect of the result too. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs very much for their excellent work. Effective supervision of medical products provides protection for the citizens of Europe and, at the same time, gives more power to responsible patients. Two points in particular are very important to me: the safety web portal for medicines and the patient information leaflet (PIL). The positive news is that tomorrow’s resolution will introduce safety web portals for medicines into all the Member States, where the approved patient information leaflet and other information must be published. This will put an end to an untenable situation. In many Member States, it is not possible to publish the PIL on the web. However, this is not in line with the real lives of many citizens who make use of the right of free movement within the European Union. Now they will be able to download PILs from the web in their own language anywhere in Europe. This will also be useful for patients who have lost their PIL. At the same time, I want the PIL to be improved and I am very pleased about the resolution calling on the Commission to submit draft legislation on this subject. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, today’s good news is that the new legislation will provide uniform, mandatory nutritional labelling that relates to 100 grams, thereby providing greater comparability. Statements of nutritional value provide consumers with information that allows them to make an informed purchasing decision. The model I have in my mind is that of the responsible consumer who knows what he is buying. Imitation products that are not clearly marked as such deliberately mislead consumers. Imitation cheese, pressed ham products, vanilla yoghurt that contains no vanilla whatsoever – these are just a few examples. All these imitation products must be labelled as such. I am pleased that we will send a clear signal to the Council tomorrow and that all of us here are agreed that we need better labelling. As far as I am concerned, the task is to provide information; we should leave consumers to make up their own minds, however. That is why I am against traffic light labelling. There are no unhealthy foods – only unhealthy, unbalanced diets. The traffic lights are misleading. I am in favour of food labelling according to the GDA model and am pleased that we are likely to vote to move towards this tomorrow. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

 Mr President, I just wanted to say that my voting machine has stopped working. I have not been able to take part in the last three votes. I would be grateful if you could send a technician. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

 – (DE)
 Mr President, consumer protection is a very, very important matter for me and therefore I am against consumers being misled or deceived in any way. This is why I am fighting for better labelling of food imitations in the Regulation on the labelling of foodstuffs, for example. I am calling on the Council to follow this approach, which is also supported by the Commission. Today, we had to vote on glued meat. Glued meat is meat which is glued together and sold as a high-quality product. In my opinion, this should not be happening, in particular, when consumers are not aware of what is going on. The decision today was not an easy one for me. The Commission has proposed comprehensive labelling rules, but consumers may still be misled, because it is difficult to prove that a product contains thrombin. This means that it may be used but not indicated on the label. Therefore, I think a labelling requirement is not sufficient in this case. I have now voted in favour of the resolution and of a ban on thrombin. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, the climate negotiations in Copenhagen were disappointing for the European Union, as has already been mentioned. The result was a long way from the EU position and from the position that we need to be in to protect the climate. The only positive aspect is the recognition of the two-degree goal, as this could lead to the necessary reduction commitments. We must now ask ourselves what we can learn from the failure of the negotiations and what we should do next. It is important to have a period of reflection and to take a critical look at different points on the route that we have been following. We have to ask ourselves how we can make progress jointly with other states. How can we ensure that the EU is also present at the table when the US, China and India meet to negotiate a compromise? How can we negotiate more effectively with the developing countries and emerging economies? Is it essential that these negotiations take place under the aegis of the UN? Finally, I would like to say how pleased I am that I was able to vote for the resolution, because in my opinion, it continues to emphasise the pioneering role played by the European Union. We must now answer these questions and continue on our current path, both from a domestic and an international perspective. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank you most sincerely for the clarity of your words. Essentially, it should be said that, overall, the Toys Directive has brought a considerable improvement in the protection of our children. We all approached it with the intention of producing the most stringent legislation anywhere in the world. However, many parents and grandparents are now concerned – as you said – because of the studies by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. We now need to ask ourselves whether or not the Institute’s statements and opinion are right. In any case, we need to examine the facts of the matter very closely. It is a question of the protection of our children. At this point, I would like to thank you most sincerely for having stated that you are willing to do that. However, I think that things need to move more quickly. Not until next year, you say, during the first half of the year, will the findings of the scientific committee be available. It must be done quicker than that. It is a question of the protection of our children. I really cannot understand why the Federal Institute left it so long to come out with these statements. I want to make that point here, too. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the German conservative group (CSU) would like to see clear and practical rules for the protection of non-smokers being introduced throughout Europe. However, in my opinion, ‘throughout Europe’ does not necessarily mean ‘from within Europe’. Many Member States already have in place regulations for protecting non-smokers and others are in the process of introducing regulations of this kind. I do not believe – in common with the majority of my fellow Members in the European Parliament, which is very pleasing – that we in Brussels must impose regulations for the protection of non-smokers or that we are able to do this more effectively. The European Union has no authority in this area. We are only responsible for health and safety at work. This is where the problem lies, because for me the most important issue is protecting children and young people and this group, which specifically needs protection, would not be covered by regulations that refer only to health and safety at work. Therefore, the Member States must take action in this area. I have voted in favour and I am pleased that this amendment was accepted. Anja Weisgerber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, we need clear and practical rules for the protection of non-smokers to be introduced throughout Europe. However, in my opinion ‘throughout Europe’ does not necessarily mean ‘from Europe’. Many Member States already have in place legislation to protect non-smokers and others are in the process of introducing laws of this kind. Why are some of my fellow Members now saying that we in Brussels can do this much better than the Member States, regardless of the fact that the European Union has no authority on health policy and that we have to implement this via the circuitous route of health and safety at work? In my opinion, the Member States should decide which regulations to put in place to protect non-smokers. This makes sense, because they are closer to the local problems and issues. I do not understand why Brussels should impose protection for non-smokers in Lapland and in Andalusia which is identical in every detail. What has happened to the cross-border implications? We in Brussels have come up against our limits in this respect. For me, protecting children and young people is particularly important. We need comprehensive protection in this area. If we introduce protection for non-smokers on a European level via health and safety at work, we are not protecting children and young people, because they are not employees. Therefore, I would ask you to support Amendments 2 and 13 put forward by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Manfred Weber,

Mr President, Vice-President Reding, Mr Mavroyiannis, ladies and gentlemen, in July, contrary to existing laws, an impartial Ombudsman who has long campaigned against corruption was replaced by a government with someone who is willing to tow the party line. Two pieces of emergency legislation were passed that drastically reduce the powers of the constitutional court and change the legal position for a referendum to suspend the president from office while the case is in progress. An extremely dubious suspension procedure was pursued against the state president that was no longer under the supervision of the constitutional court as a result of the emergency legislation. The quorum requirements of the constitutional court were ignored. Finally, there are reports of irregularities in the electoral lists for the referendum on the suspension of the office of president, indicating that the electoral lists were even changed after the ballot was complete. To cap it all: constitutional lawyers and advocates have received personal threats during the process. As I read this list, you might think I am talking about a banana republic in some obscure part of the world. However, I am, in fact, talking about reports that we received during the summer from Romania, a Member State of the European Union. These reports and the discussions we have had to hold about them are disappointing and quite simply unacceptable. I am therefore pleased and grateful that the President of the Commission and, above all, our Vice-President, Ms Reding, have responded in a committed and decisive manner, demanding an explanation from Romania. It is unacceptable, however, for Prime Minister Ponta to promise the President of the Commission that the illegal and highly undemocratic emergency legislation will be repealed, while doing nothing at home in Romania. On the contrary, Mr Ponta has exploited the opportunity to bad-mouth the European Union. This is unworthy of a democratically elected prime minister and shows a profoundly undemocratic attitude of mind. Thanks again to the Commission for its decisive stance. The citizens of Romania and of Europe as a whole appreciate this. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Manfred Weber  (PPE

 I am happy to answer this question because Mr Paşcu is surely aware that neither he, nor I, nor Prime Minister Ponta is entitled to assess whether or not a court is biased in its decisions. A constitutional court is independent and, as such, is required to reach independent decisions, which both of us need to accept. You come from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. Your party has now decided not to hold your party congress in Bucharest because all party leaders in Europe say: I refuse to be photographed with Ponta. This is the reality and this is why I would ask the social democrats to go to Bucharest and say: see to it that the rule of law is implemented. Manfred Weber,

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the discussion of Schengen has generated a lot of headlines in Europe in recent weeks. For that reason, it is good that we are discussing this matter in Parliament today. I would like to start by indicating the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for the Commissioner in respect of the examination of the very specific detailed accusations in the European Union, and if it is found that offences have been committed at European internal borders, they should be properly investigated by the Commission, because the PPE Group wants a strong European authority that will monitor Schengen status in future. That brings us to the real debate, which is one that, ultimately, concerns us all. With its decision on the Schengen rules, the Council was itself probably not altogether clear on what it was hoping to achieve, because it has not only set out on a path that we consider to be dubious in terms of content, it has also, by choosing a new legal basis, departed from the path of cooperation with Members of this House. The Council has also interfered in one of Europe’s most important achievements, namely the open borders. For us, Schengen means freedom in place of borders, cooperation in place of egoism and working together instead of working against one another. The freedom to travel in Europe is the PPE Group’s top priority. The people, the economy and indeed the whole of Europe will benefit from this. We do not want the open borders, which are a visible feature of European cooperation, to be disproportionately restricted, particularly at a time when more European spirit is needed. As the PPE Group, we want the Member States to stop doing secret deals with each other on how essential rights of their citizens are to be dealt with. This method has failed; we must focus on the Community method. The PPE Group wants the decision making to come out of the diplomatic backrooms and the decisions on these new legal bases to be made by the elected bodies in which citizens are represented. The PPE Group will fight to retain these rights in Europe. As far as the content is concerned, we do not see any insurmountable obstacles. The question is whether we will actually find a way forward in this process together. I have to say, Mr Mavroyiannis, that this is not the way for family members to treat each other. It destroys the spirit of European cooperation. We therefore ask the Council to return to the path of cooperation, and – as you said yourself today – more intensive contact is not enough for the European Parliament. We are legislators and we are involved in the decision, and for that reason I would ask you to withdraw your decision on the legal basis and involve Parliament as an equal legislator. Manfred Weber  (PPE
),

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we want to use the time tomorrow to discuss the current political situation in Romania, for three essential reasons. Firstly, we have all read in the newspapers that the matter at issue is a dispute about whether the Prime Minister is responsible for his doctoral thesis. His doctoral thesis is not our affair, however. Our subject instead is what is being done to the ethics commission in Romania responsible for resolving such incidents, which is a source of indignation for us – how people are being appointed ex post facto
, how the ethics commission is being padded out, in order to possibly reach different results, and also how these results are being published in the official gazette, amended between Parliament and the government, in order to be able to react as quickly as possible and to be able to water down disagreeable judgments. The second thing that bothers us is the issue of what happened to the public television service in Romania. The legal basis for public service television in Romania states that the parliamentary groups are to be represented proportionately in the monitoring committees, while the people who have now been appointed all belong to the government’s political group, which is thus a violation of the law. The third request that we have, the third consideration that bothers us, is probably the most weighty, the most difficult, which is Romania’s representation at the European Council at the end of the week. I say this as there has been a dispute between the President and the Prime Minister as to who will represent Romania at the summit. This question was put to the Romanian constitutional court, which unambiguously decided that the President is responsible for representing the country abroad. The Prime Minister, meanwhile, has rejected this decision by the constitutional court and mobilised his parliamentary group to fight back. All of these are points where we ask the question of whether a prime minister is in a position to adhere to the democratic ground rules, the ground rules according to the constitution, or whether he wants to lead his country into a constitutional crisis. (Heckling)
 We therefore ask to debate this. Those Members who were heckling should bear in mind that we, as Parliament, need to take a critical view of developments – seriously, Mr Swoboda – and not view them through our party political spectacles. We should at least have the opportunity to discuss this – no more and no less! Anyone with nothing to hide need not be afraid of a debate. Manfred Weber,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would urge that we vote now. We have had two months to discuss this subject in depth. There has been a lot of discussion between the groups. Then, in the last few days, pressure from the genetic engineering lobby was also added to the mix, and this has now caused confusion once again. We are of the opinion that we have discussed all there is to discuss and that a decision can now be taken. There are two arguments: our citizens are expecting signals from us with regard to how we are going to deal with biopatents, and the European Patent Office is also expecting clear signals from Parliament on how the current law is to be implemented. That is why we should decide today. Manfred Weber  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Bødskov, we should admit to each other that we are all struggling to uphold data protection for our European citizens. We should also listen seriously to what Mr Watson underlined in his short speech, namely that the fight against terrorism is a common cause and that the people who experienced the terror attack in Toulouse should also be remembered in this House. We need to weigh up both arguments. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) clearly recognises the United States of America as our partner in the global challenge that is the fight against terror. We see the US as a partner and wish to work with it. I believe that we should avoid getting involved in this role play where the US is the bad guy that wants our data, while we Europeans reap the benefits of the results of the analyses, which will, after all, also be available to the European authorities. We must all shoulder our responsibilities, which means that we Europeans must take action. Every country has the sovereign right to decide how people enter its territory and what information it requires. Just as we are in discussions on this issue with Canada and Australia, so we are now also in discussions with the US. This agreement will offer us greater legal certainty. Anyone voting against the agreement is voting for less legal certainty. These are the alternatives on offer today. I would like to thank the Commissioner for making it clear that Europe is stronger when it acts collectively and that the European Union can achieve more than 27 countries negotiating separately. The PPE Group supports partnership with the US, which is why I would like to take a look towards the future. The reason why we are discussing a framework agreement on data protection is because the interchange of data will become more important in the future. For this reason, I would also call on the US to stay at the negotiating table and to take the Europeans’ offer seriously, so that we can draw up global standards for data exchange and data protection. If we in Europe and the US manage to conclude a joint framework agreement, then there is a chance that we will be able to establish global standards. This would represent genuine added value for the citizens of Europe. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Weber, Manfred  (PPE

 Mr Tavares, any criminal investigator working in the fight against terrorism will tell you that it is never one item of information that solves a case, but rather the overall picture built up. It is a question of how terror funds itself. It is a question of who has had phone contact with a terrorist. That is why we need to discuss data retention. It is also a question of the movement profile of a terrorist or possible perpetrator. The overall picture is what counts. I never claimed that just one data record would provide a result. What I did say, however, is that we need to uphold the data protection interests of our citizens, while at the same time considering what authority and what data we need to give to criminal investigators to enable them to do their job, namely to foil future terror attacks. Careful consideration is needed here. Those who reject the agreement today must also respect the fact that some data will simply remain unavailable. I said nothing more.

 Mr Albrecht, when I speak with criminal investigators, they tell me that we would have been unable to uncover a whole host of activities ahead of terrorist acts if it were not for our partnership with the US. This is what criminal investigators tell me. It is for this reason that I say that the United States of America is a partner of Europe in the joint war against terror. As I believe the United States to be a fair partner, I am happy to sit down with it to hammer out an agreement. This does not give carte blanche
 to all the countries of the world. If you are implying that we would equate our partnership with the United States with a partnership with China, then I am afraid I must disagree with you. I regard the United States as a true partner. I believe that this agreement will strengthen the Commission’s capacity to monitor the US and what it does with these data and whether it plays by the rules in implementing what has been agreed between us. I want a strong Europe. I also accept the United States as a fair partner that wishes to join us in the joint fight against terror.

 Unlawful? This question can be evaluated in political terms. You seem to disagree with me on this. If we take a look at the agreement, we have an organisation that has the right of initiative when it comes to negotiating an agreement and the resources to evaluate it, namely the Commission. The Commission’s legal services have stated that the agreement is in order. This is the legal situation. If others disagree, whether fellow Members of the House, Member States, or European governments, then they are completely at liberty to take the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union and to have it examined there. That is our legal system. I have absolutely no problem with that. However, to imply that a person is contradicting the law, despite the fact that the Commission’s legal services’ indicate that it is in order, is taking things too far. If this agreement is rejected, I am inclined to ask myself how you intend to explain to our citizens that we will find ourselves in a legal vacuum in which the United States will negotiate directly with the airlines and possibly even with the individual Member States. How will you explain to citizens that there are no longer any ground rules in relation to this data exchange issue. That is the issue facing us right now. Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have principles in the European Union, including the independence of the judiciary and the central bank and fundamental democratic rights. If there are any doubts about these fundamental rights or principles, we need to discuss them. The right place for these discussions is here in the European Parliament. For this reason, I would like to emphasise specifically how grateful I am to Mr Orbán, the Prime Minister of Hungary, for coming here. He was not invited. He said: I will take part in the discussion, because we have nothing to hide. I would like to emphasise too that Mr Orbán is here and is listening while many of those Members who were so hysterical and dramatic that they could hardly contain themselves have obviously already left the Chamber. He is still here and we should acknowledge that. If we leave the party politics to one side, the facts are quite simple: Europe has ground rules which apply to all of us. The job of the Commission is to ensure that everyone follows these rules and that is what it has done. The Hungarian Government has already promised on several occasions to deal with these problems and to make the necessary changes. These are the facts. If we could simply put aside the political hysteria, then we would be able to talk objectively about the situation. I have heard nothing new today from those on the left concerning the facts. Mr Swoboda stands up and says that the judiciary may be independent. Then I hear from Mr Orbán that there was absolutely no criticism of the constitution. Next Mr Verhofstadt says that this is not about individual legal details. It is about the fundamental question of whether Hungary is still democratic. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) stand for law and justice. If anyone has a criticism, they must substantiate it objectively and in terms of its content with regard to the judicial issues and not simply claim that someone has acted undemocratically. What we are experiencing in many areas is quite simply an arbitrary approach. If I do not like a specific aspect of the legislation in Hungary, I describe it as undemocratic, radical and right-wing or totalitarian. We in the PPE Group will not tolerate this. Finally, I would like to say that I have been working in this Parliament since 2004. I was involved with the case of Slovakia, which introduced a law banning the use of the Hungarian language there.

Personal attacks and defamatory statements are being made with regard to the subjects under discussion. I have no doubts about my fellow Member Mr Szájer and I have no reservations about his wife, although I do not know her. Also I would like to say that if we are really taking parliaments and parliamentarianism seriously, then the European Parliament must take seriously the decisions of the Hungarian Parliament, which has the support of a two-thirds majority of the citizens. This should also be taken into account in the discussion. (Applause) Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Swoboda, saying rather offensively as an Austrian and as Chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament that you are motivated by love of Hungary and then saying to the Prime Minister of the freely elected Hungarian Parliament that you are doing this out of love, I personally find rather impertinent. You are insinuating that the freely elected Prime Minister is not doing things out of love. Therefore, I would like to ask you how you come to say that you are acting only out of love of Hungary. I believe that the freely elected Prime Minister is also acting out of love. Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, two weeks ago, the European Council met. After the summit, the Heads of State or Government appeared before the media and told the citizens of Europe how proud they were of Schengen and that they would defend Schengen against the attacks on it. When I heard these statements from our leading EU politicians, I thought to myself, ‘how bad have things got that it is now viewed as a success to defend Schengen?’ Schengen was a given that we had created in Europe, yet suddenly it is up for discussion again. The key question is how can we deal with the popularism we can sense on the Right? I think we need to take a two-pronged approach. The first element is that we need to convince people again that the project is right. We need to answer the assertion that security is improved through the introduction of border controls by explaining that it was only with the introduction of the Schengen Information System, through partnership and cooperation, that security was improved. I live in the border area between Bavaria and the Czech Republic. In my area, security has improved since border controls were abolished, as we now work with the Czech authorities. Even before abolishing the border controls, we have had more success in fighting crime in Romania and Bulgaria simply thanks to the exchange of information within the framework of the Schengen Information System. We need to convince people and win them back to the project. We need to win their hearts and I would like to see the Commission do more in this regard. Commissioner Malmström yesterday went on record saying that there had not been any problems so far in Denmark. While she may have been legally accurate, she offered too little political argument. We are not fighting for the hearts and minds of the people at this point in the way we should be. As Parliament, we can reassure the citizens that we take the Treaty of Lisbon seriously. We shall defend the Schengen agreement against all attacks that it may face with all the power we have as MEPs. If the Schengen acquis
 is to be amended, we shall ensure that it emerges from the changes stronger rather than weaker. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the European Parliament is a very hard-working body, however we need to pay more attention to a balance in the voting times, so that we do not have a situation where there is nothing to vote on one day and an enormous number of votes the next. That is why I am now proposing that we should stop voting now and defer the remaining business to the next plenary sitting. (Applause)
 There are no issues on the agenda that are so pressing that a vote is absolutely necessary today. We have already voted on the legislative points. I believe that this was the most important thing for now. (Applause) Manfred Weber  (PPE
).  
– (DE)
 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, a lot has already been said with regard to Greece. I would just like to add two thoughts on this matter. The first is that, despite all the concern and fear being felt by the people, we must not lose sight of the principles. The two principles that define Europe are solidarity – we stand by this – and a sense of individual responsibility – that the Greek people and all those who receive acts of solidarity also take responsibility themselves. The second thought is that mention has been made of the big test for Europe and of the concern that the project could perhaps even fail and that old ghosts that we had thought we had eradicated could return to the European Union. I would like to turn all of this around and look at it in a positive light. We should not just talk about the problems, but also about the successes. For example, we should mention that some of the Baltic States have managed to overcome the crisis and that, with European support, Ireland will succeed in returning to the bond markets next year. This could also be a big opportunity to prove to the people that we are stronger together than we are alone. In this context, it is quite difficult to deal with the second major issue for the Council meeting, namely that of migration. However, there is a nice link that connects the two issues, because in relation to the migration issue, in particular Schengen, we also see the same principle at work, namely that one of Europe’s major successes is now being called into question as a result of national egotism. I am sure that we have all seen the figures indicating that 18 000 refugees have arrived in Italy. However, we all know that, for Italy, 18 000 refugees is hardly an excessive burden, because twice as many refugees have been received in the last year in Belgium alone. It was therefore not right of Italy to react in the way that it did. It was internal policymaking by Italy’s minister of reforms, Umberto Bossi. On account of a few hundred people, France responded by reintroducing border controls, and that, too, was for domestic political reasons. In Denmark, too, the reasons were of an internal political nature. I would therefore like clear signals to be sent out from the Council meeting. When the question of migration and Schengen is discussed, the Heads of State or Government of the European Union must respond with the clear message that we do not want national egotism, in particular in this area. Instead we want to defend the huge success that is a free Europe. Mr Barroso, you will certainly have Parliament’s support in that. Manfred Weber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, fundamental human rights are universal, which means that they are applicable in every situation. I have been listening to the debate. None of the speakers so far, including the critics, has quoted the constitution to indicate exactly what it is they do not like. Mr López Aguilar says that he gets the impression that something has gone awry, while others are making insinuations about all the things that could go wrong with this constitution. Not one person has actually quoted from the constitution itself. That is precisely the problem that faces us in this discussion: where are the actual accusations? When I consider how the Hungarians will react to this debate and to the accusations being bandied about by some of my fellow Members without any support from direct quotations, then I can well imagine that some will find the way that the Hungarians and their country’s development are being discussed here to be extremely arrogant. As Europeans, we should take care to avoid leaving ourselves open to such accusations. I would like to state that many of those in positions of responsibility in Hungary today are the people who took to the streets to fight against communism and for liberty. It is simply unacceptable that accusations should be continuously made against these people and that the impression should be created that they are experiencing problems with freedom. This has nothing to do with party politics; it is simply a fact. Having complained that no quotes have been used during this debate, I would now like to quote from the new Hungarian constitution: ‘We are proud of the fact that our country has been part of Christian Europe for 1 000 years and we are aware of the role of Christianity in sustaining our nation’. I am pleased to find such sentiments in a constitution. This may not please all Members of this House. I am pleased that this reference to Christianity has been included and I would also have liked to have seen it included in the Treaty of Lisbon and in the European constitution. My position, as a representative of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is that this is a good thing. Manfred Weber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, Mr Alvaro, you have just demonstrated how to extend your speaking time by accepting numerous questions. However, I would like to ask you whether you are aware that the provisions for the Hungarian constitutional court – I am not sure whether you have read the Hungarian constitution in its entirety – are almost identical to those that apply to the constitutional court in Germany. Therefore, I wanted to ask you whether the German constitutional court is just as undemocratic and worthy of criticism as the Hungarian constitutional court? I would like to hear your answer to this question. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, allow me to begin with a smile as I congratulate all the Members for having survived the fire alarm and managing to take our places, safe and sound, back in the Chamber. As a representative of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to pose a question to the President of the Commission, who has been busy dealing with the pictures that we have been seeing in recent weeks from the Mediterranean, where many people fleeing from the situation in Africa have made it to Europe, while some have also failed to make it. We have had to see the images of these stranded and dead people on the news. We are all aware that it is a joint European challenge facing us to find an answer to this drama and this misery for refugees. On behalf of the PPE Group, I would like to ask the President of the Commission to give us an appraisal of whether the Commission – and, above all, Frontex – has enough resources, whether we, the European Union, have enough capabilities to respond on the ground, and whether we have enough statutory bases to enable Europe to act together in the Mediterranean region. I would also be interested to hear what form the discussions with the countries of origin (Tunisia and Egypt, for example) take and whether we Europeans are making headway in this area. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, my thanks for your assessments of the situation. Given that you state that we currently need more resources for Frontex, I would be interested to hear whether you are not also of the opinion that the Member States have hitherto been too unwilling to provide the resources to make Frontex strong. We did have the toolbox already. Was it the case that there was too little willingness on the part of the Member States to support Frontex accordingly? Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, as has already been emphasised, Schengen is one of the great achievements of our common European project. Citizens notice it on a daily basis when travelling around Europe. It is the realisation of the dream of Europe – a Europe without border controls. It must therefore first be made clear in this debate – particularly in view of the debate that has taken place in recent weeks – that we in this House will jointly ensure that this principle and the idea behind it are not derailed by any initiative or any debate. We will defend this principle in the European Parliament. In recent weeks there have been discussions concerning more than 25 000 refugees from Tunisia who have arrived in the Italian territory of Lampedusa. Yet a country such as Sweden has been accepting more than 25 000 people a year for years on end. There have been states that have accommodated much greater numbers of people relative to their own population that is currently happening on the southern border of Europe, yet nobody has ever thought of questioning Schengen because of the burden. I would therefore like to clearly stress at this stage that it is a pity that we seriously need to have a debate in Europe, of all places, on Schengen status as a result of this challenge that we must deal with together. Secondly, I should like to make it clear that we practise solidarity. When it comes to countries such as Malta – a small country that is massively affected and which has no hinterland – then we are currently practising solidarity. In addition to this solidarity, however, I should like to stress that the second basic principle is the responsibility that the countries themselves have. I must therefore also ask the Commission to look more into this. If courts in the European Union are now ruling that Dublin II is to be ineffective – in other words, that refugees are not to be deported to their states of first arrival – then we must ask the Commission how committed it will be to taking action against those states that are obviously not currently implementing the existing law. We are talking here about minimum standards in the European Union. I am therefore calling on the Commission to take action here, too. As regards the preparation for the Council, I have just three points to make. The first is that when it comes to migration then naturally we must expect more migration in the long term as a result of demographic change, but here in the European Union we currently have 24 million people without work and in Spain the youth unemployment rate is 30%. We should therefore proceed cautiously – very cautiously – when it comes to the issue of migration. My second point concerns strengthening Frontex, as has already been mentioned. My third point is that I would ask us all to ensure that those states that were about to join Schengen, namely Bulgaria and Rumania, are not left behind because of the current debate. They have done the work; they have made efforts. We are not asking for lower standards for joining, but if they meet the standards then it is only fair that Bulgaria and Rumania also have the right to become members of the Schengen area. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group

Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, transparency is a cornerstone of democracy, ensuring that people know who exerts influence and how decisions are made. Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament has significantly more power. That is why it is right that our modus operandi
 should always be open to debate and that we should question ourselves. The negotiations between the European Parliament and the Commission in relation to the transparency register are a success and we have now produced an excellent result. I would like to underline once again that it is good that we have found clear regulations for the local and regional authorities, and even for churches, that reflect their interests. I would also like to say that we do not regard lobbyism as something bad per se. We need expert opinions and we need to be able to call on experts for our work. In the end it is important that we, as parliamentarians, should be able to consider issues freely and make decisions independently. I would now like to state that we parliamentarians have a lot to be proud of. If we conduct a national comparison, we will see that there are only a few Member States of the European Union who have already established a transparency register at this level. In my country’s capital, Berlin, where I also happen to live, there is no such transparency register, which is why we should all be aware that this is a truly significant step forward. To the Council I would say: if this issue is not a problem for the Council because lobbyists have very little influence there, then it should be easier for it to sign up to the transparency register. Accordingly, the Council may be able to conquer its internal resistance. Finally, Madam President, I would point out that if we in Parliament want to escape the influence of lobbyists to a greater extent in future, then we will need greater supports and more staff, enabling us to achieve more for the citizens of the European Union. Manfred Weber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mr Barroso, the necessary Treaty modification and the institutional debate that we are holding both demonstrate that, now the Treaty of Lisbon has been in force for just over a year, we can no longer resolve the challenges which the world is presenting us with by means of the Treaty as it currently stands. That is exactly what today’s debate shows. On the other hand, when we talk about the current Treaty, we are told that a wider debate about the Treaty is inconceivable and futile in the light of the situation in the Member States and, in particular in the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic. That is the conflict which we currently find ourselves in. We need more, but we will not be getting it from the Member States. The European Parliament must provide an answer. If we listen to what the citizens are saying today, it is clear that they are aware that we need to introduce changes to the Treaty now. They are asking questions like: ‘How are we going to get the markets under control in the near future?’. This is why we need a strong Europe. However, we must ask ourselves an even more important question, which is: What good is our European project doing at the end of the day? For decades, it has been responsible for peacekeeping and for bringing war on our continent to an end. This morning, I was host to a group of visitors from a school. For young people, war is, thank goodness, no longer an issue. They cannot imagine what war might be like. In our discussions, we now raise the threat of globalisation and explain that we need Europe to keep the evil of globalisation under control, but this is a negative argument. If we want to win over not only the minds, but also the hearts of the people, we must take a step further on the question of what good the European project is doing. We must talk about the pictures and ask ourselves what Europe is achieving and what its job is. When the powerful countries in the world come together, including America, Japan, Europe, Brazil, India and so on, who will raise their hand and ask whether we are paying enough attention to social issues? China will not do so. We will have to do that ourselves. Who will raise their hand and say ‘We need to think about environmental questions’? The Americans will not do that. We will have to highlight the issue. Who will say ‘We want to maintain peace throughout the world and ensure that conflicts do not turn into wars’? We will have to do this with our historical experience. If we look at Tunisia, it is clear that the people there want the same model which we have in Europe. We have a highly attractive way of life. Therefore, when we discuss Treaty issues, when we talk about the way in which our continent functions and the job that we have to do, we must look at the big picture, so that we win not only the minds, but also the hearts of people for our project. Then, we will succeed in gaining acceptance for it at a national level. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule149(8)) Manfred Weber  (PPE

 – (DE)
 Mr President, on the one hand, it is important that the Member States are in control of the treaties, which is why the modification must take place at this level. On the other hand, we are faced with the question which is implicit in many of the questions that I have attempted to address. Are we reflecting carefully on this, are we taking enough time and being allowed enough time to discuss everything in detail? Or are people’s expectations so high and the pressure of the global challenges so great that we need to be quicker and to act more quickly? For this reason, I do not regard the issue of time as a problem, but we do need to provide answers. We must focus on that. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, asylum policy is a highly topical issue, as we have recently discovered in Lampedusa and in Greece. It is a subject that concerns the people of Europe. We should be proud of what we have achieved in Europe, including our common standards, the proper processing of asylum applications and our way of dealing with children and families. We should be proud of all of this. Europe is an area which offers help and partnership to people suffering persecution all over the world. However, the decisive factor is not what we put on paper in Parliament’s committees, in the Commission and in the Council, but what actually happens on the ground. Belgium and Greece have recently been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for not implementing and not adhering to existing legislation. This makes it clear that the enforcement process is not working. I would like to ask the Commission to make faster progress, alongside its existing action plans. We need to be able to put in place and implement the important standards more quickly within the European Union. In the specific case of Greece, I would like to point out that we have a border that can be secured from both sides. I am disappointed in the way our partner, Turkey, has behaved in this respect. We have signed a readmission agreement with Turkey, which requires the country to do far less than it would have to if it were a member of the European Union. Therefore, I think we should expect Turkey to make a greater effort in this area. No one disputes our sense of solidarity. We want to provide practical help in the form of the European Refugee Fund and Frontex, both in the case of Greece, where aid is already being provided, and in the case of Lampedusa in Italy. European solidarity is not being called into question. It is needed now more than it ever has been. Manfred Weber,  
author. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would also like to use today’s debate to take a general look at the visa policy of the European Union. Firstly, it is important to emphasise, to make ourselves aware, of the great value of this visa policy to the European Union. Since we are a common Europe, a common space for people, we are able to create a common visa policy. Our visa policy is therefore also a sign of European unity – a very successful sign of European unity – and it is important to point that out, particularly in times of crisis. Secondly, we are calling for clear rules of play when it comes to visa facilitation. The technical standards that are to be maintained – at external borders and when issuing passports and identity papers – are clearly set out. We cannot make any political concessions as regards the upholding of these standards. In 2010, we found that in the Balkans, there was initially a focus on technical standards, but political arguments were then advanced with increasing vigour. When it comes to visa facilitation, however, one cannot stop at one country; we have to view the area as a whole. Yes, it is always difficult for us to weigh things up in an individual case. However, the core of the issue is that the technical standards must be upheld; the criteria must remain. I therefore also support our Commissioner when she says that these standards that we are demanding must also be implemented in reality. That is an important task of the Commission, because only then will our visa policy be accepted by our citizens. Thirdly, I would like to mention that we welcome the fact that the last European Justice and Home Affairs Council discussed enabling visa facilitation to be rapidly lifted or withdrawn from individual states if they fail to implement the standards. The example of Serbia showed us that the result was a great influx of asylum seekers. Moving on to my final point, for the time being – when talking about Ukraine and Russia – our group is highly sceptical as regards opening the doors quickly, because we have just seen in the case of Serbia that there will also be negative effects. We should therefore proceed with great caution when it comes to visa policy. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, on the subject of Pakistan: we are debating this at a difficult time for Pakistan, and all of us, I believe, support complete solidarity with the people there who have suffered this disaster. Mr Sógor has already talked specifically about the agreement. Therefore, I would like to make a few comments on the questions relating to European Union readmission agreements with third countries in general. Firstly, these agreements make sense and they are necessary, because we have legislation in Europe that governs immigration. However, if we have legislation that governs immigration then there will also be people who are residing here illegally. It then follows logically that we also need to have repatriation. With regard to many of the principles I have just stated, the Left – the Socialists – are often on our side, but when it comes to specific decisions regarding the actual conclusion of such an agreement, they then refuse to give their consent. I therefore believe that, despite this, we need to remain consistent. Secondly, standard human rights must be respected. The alternative to such an agreement is not, of course, that we have better human rights standards. Anyone who rejects this agreement accepts the fact that we will have 27 different legal standards in the European Union which are not monitored as closely as would be the case at European level. The third, and for me the most important, question is: how can we actually make partnership with third countries attractive in future? I would ask the Commission to work in a more interconnected way in future. If we open up European markets in the world trade negotiations, the third countries must also give us the opportunity to talk about repatriation or, with regard to the question of legal immigration, third countries must be in a position to grant us concessions in connection with repatriation. In other words, a more interconnected way of working is important here. Manfred Weber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was no coincidence that we, as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), allowed our colleague, Mrs Járóka, who is the only representative of the Roma minority in this Parliament, to speak first today. This is because the PPE Group would much prefer to talk about the people’s problems today. We do not want to make a political show – we do not care about Mr Sarkozy – we want to discuss the problems we are facing with the Roma minority and how we can help them. This is also the basis of our resolution. Mr Swoboda, you said that it is scandalous that the Commission has drawn this conclusion. All I can say to that is that it is clearly scandalous to you because the Commission is not joining in with the political show that you want to make of this and has made a serious comment on the situation. Secondly, as regards the freedom of movement, everything has been said already. We have clear ground rules in the European Union. The freedom of movement is not without limit; it can be restricted on an individual basis and that is also what has been done in France. My third point is actually the important one. In the political debate on this issue, it is a question of how we can integrate the minorities in Europe into our societies. If we all accept the fact that we are open-minded and tolerant, then we are on common ground. If, as a second step, we also all accept that around 90% move towards the majority society, that we really join together and take integration seriously, then we are also still in agreement. We are divided on the question of how we should deal with migrants – regardless of what sort of migrants – who just do not accept what the majority society has to offer, who refuse to cooperate, and will not accept the ground rules. The Left in this House repeatedly presents the argument that we need to offer these people something. We in the PPE Group say that the migrants also need to accept the offers. If you do not add this requirement and stipulate it in strong terms, if you do not have a state that calls for this, then you destroy the willingness of citizens to integrate people, and you do the handiwork of the Right in this House if you do not permit the state to use this toughness. It is also permissible to say that. (Applause)
 (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, thank you for the question. The answer is also quite simple. The question of whether a law has been transposed is not decided in Europe by politicians, or by journalists. In the European Union, it is the courts that decide. In the European Union – and in France, too – we have a situation in which people belonging to the Roma groups concerned can turn to the courts and file a complaint against this on an individual basis. That has already been done. The Commissioner has pointed out that French judges also use European law as the basis for their decisions. Thus, it is not journalists who decide whether or not laws have been implemented in this European Union, it is the courts, and according to the Commission’s statement, that is clearly the way it works in France just as it does in the other Member States of the European Union. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to talk about freedom of expression in the European Union is to cover a broad subject area. I thank the Commission for the broad approach to this matter. This is a debate about principles. From my own country, Germany, I can report that one political party, a political power, namely the Social Democrats, owns newspapers and publishing houses, in other words, it has large newspapers under its control. We citizens repeatedly ask ourselves whether it is good for parties to own parts of the media or whether it would actually be better for these two to be separate. Thus, there is a great deal to discuss with regard to this issue. However, I would like to use today’s debate to talk instead about principles. The media are part of the foundation of our democracy. They inform people of factual circumstances and they scrutinise those who hold power. Of course, this task performed by the media also brings with it a large responsibility to use this power in a responsible manner. In this regard, it is important to protect peoples’ privacy and it is important that news is not reported in order to create a sensation, but to provide reliable information. In that respect, the media are part of the foundation of our civil democracy. Independence is what is most important here. Publishers must grant their journalists independence. In the national structures that we have – we as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) view this as positive, because the media are also part of our culture – we need independence from political influence, and neither must advertising customers influence the work of editorial staff. If we take a look at the reality of journalism today, one of the greatest challenges for independent journalism is probably the subject of the Internet, in other words, the ability to access information on the Internet free of charge without knowing whether this information is correct or incorrect. That is a major challenge. In order to maintain high quality journalism, which we need to ensure, even in the age of the Internet, we must uphold the copyright of the journalists who supply high quality work. This is a key challenge for the future. Manfred Weber,

 Mr President, different types of fruit take differing amounts of time to ripen.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, in its session today, the Commission approved the new SWIFT agreement, and did so by a large majority or even unanimously. I would like to ask the President of the Commission – since I am sure he is aware that many of our citizens are concerned about data being passed on – where he sees substantial progress and how we can convince our citizens of the necessity of this agreement. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I just have a brief supplementary question. It concerns the content of the agreement that you have presented. I would like to repeat my previous question. What are the implications of this agreement for transatlantic relations? How important is it for the other topics that we need to discuss with the US? If you could give us an idea of this, I would be very grateful. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).  
– (DE) 
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr López Garrido, I too would firstly like to make a short comparison with the SWIFT debate. I was quite delighted to hear the representative of the Council talk of dedicated objectives in negotiations for this new SWIFT agreement. I am therefore quite surprised by the sort of effect and power the Treaty of Lisbon and the statement by Parliament have had on the Council, which now wants to champion the interests of Europe. I hope that we experience the same momentum now when we are talking about Passenger Name Record data, and that here there is also a commitment to fighting on behalf of European interests. Secondly, I would like to say that I believe we all agree that from the point of view of legal certainty for both airlines and citizens, when it is a question of data protection rights, such agreements make sense. The standards that we want have been set out clearly in the joint resolution. Thirdly, I would like to mention a point that is not directly connected with the agreements, but definitely relates to the subject, in other words, the debate in the Council as to whether we also need or should develop a European PNR system. The last major terror threat in Europe was the Detroit case when an attacker boarded a plane and wanted to fly to Detroit. That happened last year before Christmas. In this case, we learned that in the United Kingdom, we knew that this person was a threat. However, those who decided whether he could fly or not did not have the necessary information to hand. What I want to say here is that I believe that in the European Union, the problem is not whether there is enough data available. I believe that we already know who poses a threat. The problem is getting the data to where we need it in order to prevent threats. In Toledo, the Spanish Presidency proposed – and I am grateful for this – that we strengthen the networking of counter terrorism authorities in Europe. Unfortunately, this proposal was not taken up by the European interior ministers. Instead, there was the proposal to build new data sets and gather new data. It often seems to me that for the interior ministers, collecting new data is the easy option. I would firstly ask you to attend to the networking of the authorities involved; then we would achieve a lot in the fight against terror. Manfred Weber  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schulz said that Greece has delivered and that it is now Europe’s turn. I wonder whether Europe actually needs to say ‘thank you’, nowadays, if Member States in the euro area simply keep to the rules, in other words, if they manage to get back to the 3% criterion. I also wonder what the difference was last year when Ireland faced the same situation and instituted hard cuts. Nobody came forward at that time with the idea of calling on a European Monetary Fund. Mr Verhofstadt says that speculators are at work. Clearly there is pressure in that regard at the moment, but the fact is that Greece enjoyed major rate advantages thanks to being in the euro area. Our Italian colleagues used the rate advantage they gained from their accession to the euro area to consolidate. Greece consumed it. We can indeed therefore say that the good European today is not the one who is putting his or her money on the table; the good European is the one who actually implements the rules that everyone has signed up to and accepted, so that they are actually complied with in the European Union. As a second point, I would like to give my backing to the Commission because the proposals that are on the table for the long-term future represent a move in the right direction. We have agreed the 3% and we therefore need a strong Commission that will, in future, monitor and also enforce that 3% limit. We have seen how the Member States in the euro area are unable to police each other and to observe the 3% limit on their own. That is why I am in favour of a strong Commission that will be able, in future, to see that the criteria are met. I have one more thought. We should talk positively about the euro. It is not a currency crisis that we have; it is an economic crisis. The euro is a major benefit for everyone. If our leaders in the European Union no longer say that, if that point is no longer made in the Council, people will not know it. That is why I am in favour of this major, strong currency. Manfred Weber  (PPE

 Mr President, that is very helpful. Thank you very much for making this possible. If I have understood things correctly, because this is a sensitive issue that we are discussing, then Mr Rubalcaba cannot assure us that the existing agreement will not come into force. In other words, if we postpone matters and give ourselves more time, it will come into effect. Therefore, my next question is: Can Mr Rubalcaba assure us that, for example, a long-term agreement will be in place within a month with higher standards or is the Council telling us that we must still wait nine months until the end of the period? It is very hard for Parliament to accept an unconditional assurance. Therefore, we must have clear conditions relating to the Council’s assurance, in order to be able to decide tomorrow about a possible postponement. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Mr Rubalcaba, Commissioners, I am pleased that we are not only talking about SWIFT and body scanners today, but also having a general debate on the war on terror, because this is a subject that affects us all. Looking back, we have to say that terrorism is a real threat to the people of Europe. We are taking positive action and I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the public authorities. The people who are responsible for security have done a good job over recent years. I would also like to thank our partners. Now we must look to the future. What will we be faced with over the next few years? In this respect, I have three specific requests or proposals. The first concerns cooperation among the authorities in Europe. Every document comes with a headline emphasising the importance of collaborating and strengthening our cooperation. These are wonderful words, but nothing has happened in practice. Once again nothing happened in Toledo with regard to practical cooperation. There is no lack of action – this has been made clear in Detroit. What we are lacking is cooperation between the authorities. That is where the problem lies. Therefore, I would like to ask the Council finally to do its job in this area and to call on the Commission to put some appropriate proposals on the table. My second point is that we should investigate our existing legislation with regard to the collection of data and mobile phone data, for example, in the case of the retention of data. For this reason, you have the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for this evaluation. After an interval of a few years, it is important to put it to the test. Thirdly, we have just had a discussion about SWIFT. I would like to ask the House why our cooperation with the United States has to be organised in this way. It has to be organised like this because we Europeans are not in the position to evaluate the data ourselves. Therefore, the question arises as to whether we are self-confident enough to evaluate it ourselves. This is another thought for the future. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Mr López Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, this whole debate was, of course, initially coloured by the frustration and irritation that many people in the European Parliament felt because we had the impression that, once again, things were being rushed through in the Council before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. For that reason, I am now thankful that the Council has realised that it is good to consult Parliament, to now apply the new Treaty of Lisbon in the ratification process and also to give us the opportunity to assess whether this agreement is to be applied or not. In this legislative process, if we now start it, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will apply clear decision-making criteria. There are two sides to the coin. On one side, we as the PPE Group hold the clear principle that for European data – wherever this is stored – European data protection standards should apply. We hold the principle that we want a right of appeal for people who feel they have been unfairly treated in being subjected to data checks. We hold the basic principle that data should be passed on only in individual cases and only if the person is suspected of something, not simply as a general rule. These are things that we regard as important. On the other side of the coin, there is the fact that we, of course, want cooperation with the United States. We want to cooperate with our partners in the fight against terror. We do not want a situation in which individual states – if agreements expire – are put under particular pressure, like Belgium for example, because then states might start to operate on a bilateral basis. Careful consideration is also needed here. As the PPE Group, we will give consideration to this when the legislative proposal is presented. I would ask the Council and the Commission once again not to play for time, but to send the text now so that we can deal with it. As Parliament, we are capable of working quickly and we will be able to deal with this quickly. Then it will be up to the ministers – and just to make this very clear: the interior ministers – to convince Parliament that these methods that are now being proposed in this agreement really are necessary for the fight against terror. We are open to this process, but the task of convincing us is still to be done by the executive, in other words the ministers. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).  
– (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to look at the procedural argument. I would like to remind everyone that we have just voted on the Cashman report. This is a report created by Parliament in the course of an ongoing legislative procedure. Our Legal Service has stated that this is not permitted, but the socialists insisted on introducing it. While we were discussing the freedom of the press in Italy and the Commissioner responsible explained that the European Union has no authority in this area, the socialists still felt that it was worthwhile to attack Berlusconi. Whenever it suits the socialists, it is a question of there being no authority. Whenever other people are being opposed, the authority is in place. For this reason, we should not give in to them. However, the second argument is worthy of serious discussion. Are we responsible for the Convention on Human Rights? I would like to remind my fellow Members that, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union will become party to the Convention on Human Rights. This means that if it is legitimate for the Italian Parliament to discuss this, because Italy is party to the Convention on Human Rights, then it is also legitimate for the European Parliament to discuss this, as it will be party to the Convention on Human Rights in future. My third and final argument concerns the fact that we are not lawyers, we are politicians. This judgment affects millions of people and, therefore, we should vote on it today. (Applause) Manfred Weber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, I am grateful for the opportunity to hold this debate. Mr López Aguilar referred to the fact that in his opinion, as a lawyer, we are not responsible. I am not speaking as a lawyer, but as a politician. Millions of people in Europe are affected by this judgment by the judges in Strasbourg. This is why it is a good thing that we are discussing it here. The relationship between church and state in Europe has always been disputed and has led to bloody conflicts. It is right and proper that the European Union has managed to separate the state from religion. This is a good thing. However, we have a wide range of different models in Europe. France is clearly a non-religious state, while in Great Britain, the Head of State, the Queen, is also the head of the church. We have different models of how the relationship between church and state has developed. For this reason, I believe it is a good thing that we are calling for subsidiarity in this area and that every country can go its own way. I would even like to take things a step further. I do not want to talk about subsidiarity, but about the basic issue that, from my perspective, the European values of solidarity, subsidiarity and freedom are unthinkable without a foundation in Christianity and in the Judaeo-Christian understanding of religion. Why do we not find these values in China or in the Middle East? This is because they are based on our culture and our religions. It is possible to mention this without forcing anyone to accept the same faith. We are proud of our religious freedom. There is religious freedom in the sense that it is possible for me to decide to be an atheist. That is acceptable and legitimate and we have fought for this. However, there is also the right to have a faith. In my region, where more than one million people live, over 80% are Catholics. Just as atheists call for others to show them tolerance, so the Catholics who make up more than 80% of the population are calling for non-believers to be tolerant of their faith. They want to be able to show their faith in public, to represent it and to have Christian symbols accepted by the minority in this majority society. This is also legitimate in terms of religious freedom. Anyone who calls for tolerance must also show tolerance to those who practise a Christian faith. Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, I have been here in the European Parliament for 5 years now, and I work in the field of internal affairs and the law. Today, therefore, is a day of joy for me, when we have the opportunity to debate the programmes for the next five years, when we will be able to deliberate on this future as a European Parliament on an equal legislative footing. We are discussing a dossier, a subject area, that exercises the public, where the public expect answers from us, where they even say that this is an area where we need more Europe. That is not so for every subject area, but in this case it is. They are making demands of us. They want answers from us. I therefore want to very briefly describe the change that will result from the new working basis and these subjects. The first point is working with the Council. We always have representatives of the Council here and they always tell us, as Presidents-in-Office of the Council, that Parliament is very important and that we must work together. When they leave that role, however, that understanding often crumbles away. It will be our job, as parliamentarians, to demand of the Council that it no longer allow this understanding to slip away, or for it – as with the SWIFT agreement, for example – to create precedents, despite not involving us here in Parliament in the approval process. That cannot, and in future, will not, be the situation any longer. It was a bad example of the institutions taking each other seriously. My second point is that we must be creators of ideas. The new treaty gives us the opportunity to table legislative initiatives. If we want to strengthen Frontex, we cannot just call for things to happen and just make proposals, we must also put legislation on the table. In future, we will have the opportunity to do that. My third point is that we also need to be a serious partner, one that does not just draw up wish lists. If, for example, we are dealing with the fight against illegal migration, we must not just take on NGO positions, we must be a serious partner. Finally, the European Parliament must take subsidiarity seriously. If we have competence, we must also consider which subject areas would be better dealt with at the national or regional level. These are four subjects that I think are important for the forthcoming few years. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would have liked the proposals for the Stockholm Programme to have been much more ambitious still, but today is a day to rejoice that we are entering this new phase, and all that remains to be said is let us get on with the work! Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group. 
– (DE) 
Mr President, I should like to support and speak in favour of the motion. Not every issue in Europe is an issue for Europe. We practise subsidiarity and we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) have confidence in our colleagues in the parliament in Rome and trust in the Roman courts, in the Italian courts, which can rule independently on what is good for Italy and what is not good for Italy. The Italian parliament has just proven that it is independent. We are happy to debate freedom of opinion, but then we should also debate freedom of opinion in the European Union. That must be clear in the motion and its title, which is why we are asking for support for our motion. Manfred Weber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of Mr Mauro’s persuasive speech, suddenly even Mr Schulz has conceded that it would be a good thing for us to talk about Europe as a whole now. Alas, the title of today’s debate is Italy. I can absolutely see why many of you have no interest in talking about Europe as a whole. If, for example, I were to look at the media interests of Germany’s Social Democrats, I would observe that they own 90% of the newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau
 and that the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) owns 57% of the Neue Westfälische
 newspaper and holds an interest in the WAZ media group. The largest source of income for the SPD today is its media interests. I can therefore absolutely see why many of you have no interest in talking about ownership in other cases, but instead only want to discuss Italy. This debate is fizzling out because of the situation in Italy and the positive statements that we are hearing. I am not Italian, as you can tell when I speak, but the most convincing argument that comes to my mind is the question of what was the matter between 2006 and 2008 when Italy had a leftist government and, of course, at that time – as Mr Mauro has pointed out – everything was fine and dandy. There were no legislative proposals tabled by the then government to finally end the concentration of the media, though the power was there. Today, when there is once again a clear majority for the conservative parties in Italy, there are suddenly problems again. This debate must not give way to dishonesty. As long as the socialists, the leftists in this House, no longer have arguments to back us into a corner, I can very happily carry on with this debate! Manfred Weber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Western Balkans need Europe and we Europeans need stability in the Western Balkans. The Western Balkans are a central part of Europe and we must do our utmost to bring this important part back home to Europe. For that reason, these are the right proposals. The reality of life in this area has been described; the depressingly long queues at visa offices, the young people with no prospect of making an application to leave the country and get a taste of life in Europe. A lot of people experience this area as a prison, where they have no contact with the outside world. We all want to put an end to this and, in my group, Mrs Pack, Mrs Bildt and Mr Posselt are working on this with a great deal of dedication. We all stand for this. What worries us is that, as a result of the different treatment of the states in this area, there will be separatist movements and different classes of citizens in the area of the Western Balkans will be created, which could certainly lead to problems. However, the citizens in the European Union equally expect security. That means that the standards that Commissioner Barrot described here today, namely security standards for police cooperation, in the fight against illegal immigration and economic migration and for biometric data, are the agreed minimum standards which represent the rules of play. Our citizens expect those rules of play to be adhered to. That brings me to my second point: there must be no foreign policy concessions on the question of visa waiver. We should not give these states a free rein. The rules of play are clear and anyone who abides by them has every chance of having visas waived. The pressure on the states which have been unable to improve their standards hitherto, despite EU aid, should not let up. These are the two flanks that we in the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) consider to be right. We trust in the evaluation that the European Commission has carried out and can therefore approve the present step. Manfred Weber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, during this debate many people have expressed their gratitude to the Czech Presidency for the fact that it has still managed to complete a few projects, in administrative terms, by the end of its term of office. I ask myself in all seriousness: have we really become so modest in our expectations? We are in the business of politics. What we actually expect, in the greatest economic crisis for decades which is combined with environmental challenges, is a Presidency which shows leadership and vision. That is what we really expect. We have seen that the administrative work has been completed for what is still on the table at end of the term of office. I really would have expected more. Prime Minister, if you meet with President Klaus this evening, please tell him that had an opportunity during these six months to make the Czech national identity and sovereignty clear to Europe by showing strong leadership. He did of course promote the importance of national sovereignty here in Parliament. Unfortunately, he missed the opportunity. Markus Ferber,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that, through today’s debate on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments, we have advanced into the core area for financial market regulation within this legislative period; now we need to regulate the financial markets and not just look at individual products, as we did in the past. I just want to pick out a few key terms. In the last year we have not made life easy for ourselves. We have conducted a hearing in committee, we have surveyed all the stakeholders and every interested group, and on this basis, through various processes, working documents and the like, produced a result which we are setting before this plenary session here today and tomorrow. I will take a few points from it. Firstly, market structure. On the one hand, we must concede that in recent years something has happened in the financial markets which has made it in Parliament’s interest that each trade in securities takes place under the MiFID rules, which is why we have approved a new category – bounded by many conditions – called Organised Trading Facilities, where only non-equities can be traded, where proprietary trading is forbidden and where, with regard to execution, transaction and customer interaction, execution may take place at the operator’s discretion. Through this process I think that we are making an important contribution to ensuring that the entire area of traded OTC papers is handled within the MiFID environment. Another major subject not considered in the last MiFID is algorithmic or high-frequency trading. Once again, we needed to issue clear rules here, so that these areas, which can be very dangerous and can be manipulatively employed, is subject to a strict system with minimum holding periods, trade interruption opportunities, the option to test algorithms, the option of examining algorithms within the supervisory structure, the introduction of tick-size regimes, a minimum price, and corresponding fee systems.  Another subject I would like to touch on is the area of commodities futures markets. I do believe that we have a particular responsibility here, when it comes to restricting the speculative part of commodities futures markets, not to contribute through bad regulation to a situation where people in the third and fourth worlds can no longer buy food. Because of this, we have chosen a two-pronged approach with the aim of curbing speculation but not thereby damaging the real economy. We want to achieve this by using position limits with strict ceilings on the number of contracts or positions. We also want to ensure, by means of the position-check system, that those who can prove that they really need a product do not suddenly speculate in this market. Another issue that concerns us is the area of investor protection. I would like to point out here that we have chosen a very broad approach in guaranteeing protection for consumers and investors. This means that the requirements of specific customer groups need to be identified. Not every small saver needs access to highly complex papers. What is needed is to define the relevant products for target groups, carry out product testing, make telephone recordings, give relevant advice, disclosure requirements, but – I want to briefly mention – to proceed, with regard to commissions, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. Member States should be able, according to their structures, to make relevant accommodations. I think we are on the right track here. My time is running out, so I thank everyone who has been involved. I think it is a shame that we only have four minutes’ speaking time for such a complex report. I thank all my colleagues who collaborated on this and the Commission for the very constructive role it has played in recent weeks and months. I hope that a strong vote in the plenary session tomorrow will put us in a situation to negotiate with the Council in order to resolve this important report as soon as possible. Markus Ferber,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief. Firstly, I am pleased that I have such wide support, from the extreme left to the extreme right. I do not know whether this is a good thing – but perhaps it is helpful to have found a compromise in the middle.  Secondly, I want to point out here that we are talking about financial market regulation. Therefore, it depends on which markets trading takes place on. Trading in financial products always involves risk: there is no such thing as a risk-free financial market. If you demonise financial markets per se, you will be unhappy with any regulation. This was not our intention. It was our intention, on the one hand, to ensure that every trade in financial products takes place within a regulated framework and, on the other hand, that these financial markets generate added value for the economy and do not exist purely for their own sake. If we have anything to learn from the time before 2008 it is that financial markets acted independently and did not generate any added value for the real economy – this has been the painful experience of recent years. As a result, we have produced something together. My heartfelt thanks, therefore, go to all the shadow rapporteurs who collaborated on this report. We will have the privilege of holding meetings with the Council over the coming months in order to produce a good result. I hope that we can take the good spirit we have maintained in discussions over almost a year into those negotiations. Markus Ferber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is important that we as the European Parliament grapple very hard with the European Semester – after all, we introduced it when we negotiated the ‘six-pack’. Why? I believe that we in Europe have not been suffering from formulating the rules of the game together but rather we are suffering from the fact that, in the end, the rules are not being applied as they were formulated at the European level. Parliament ought to lead this process very strongly and also to continue to touch on the sore points where things are not working as agreed.  I think that the report before us – for which I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, in particular – provides an important indicator of what can be improved in the interaction between Member States, national parliaments, the European Parliament, the Commission, which must oversee the whole procedure, and the processes that then take place in the Member States. We must now cooperate to use all the euphoria, the spirit of optimism – that is right, we want to make things better for the future – and this momentum, if we want Europe to learn lasting lessons from the financial, economic and national debt crisis. There are many, many important contributions here, both in the individual reports from the Commission to the Member States and in the work we at Parliament have produced.  Many thanks to the rapporteur for this. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) emphatically supports this report. However, over the coming weeks, months and years we will ensure not only that many documents are written but that policy is implemented in the interests of European citizens and taxpayers. Markus Ferber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should concentrate on today’s subject, and forget about things that are off topic. What are we discussing today? We are discussing how we want to bring Parliament and the Member States together in order to establish strict ground rules that will not go the way of all things European, which is to say that, while they may be adopted here, when it comes to application, they no longer play a major role, as we have already experienced in many, many cases – not only with the euro, but elsewhere, too. We want to establish ground rules that really oblige the Member States to do things that are urgently necessary, in order to guarantee that which states were originally created to provide, namely, guaranteeing infrastructure, education, employment, social security and many other things for the people, although not at the expense of future generations or other Member States. We should therefore not do the other thing proposed in numerous amendments, which is to say, we should not accompany this obligation with the development of any new sources of funding that have only one purpose, namely, to reward those who have not kept to the rules hitherto and punish those who have. A Europe on that basis will not work in the long term. Europe will only work if everyone adheres to the ground rules agreed. The idea of a debt redemption fund must therefore be rejected. Such a fund punishes those who kept their houses in order, to the benefit of those who did not. The idea of eurobonds must therefore be rejected. Such bonds punish those who acted properly and adhered to the rules and reward those who did not. These sections should therefore be rejected. Markus Ferber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with all the problems relating to the details that we could talk about, and which we will be talking about, in the further legislative procedure, we should not lose sight of one thing: financial markets cannot function according to a model in which, when everything is going well, the banks take the profits, and then, when something goes wrong, taxpayers have to pick up the tab. That is why it makes sense for there also to be a tax on financial transactions. It also makes sense for this to be done in a cross-border arrangement. In Europe – or at least in the euro area – this would not result in distortions; rather, it would make a lasting contribution to bringing about a stable financial market which generates what financial markets are actually there for, namely, to provide enterprises with access to capital, to allow savers to save or put something aside for their old age, and so that the financial markets can once again do the job for which they were once created, which is to provide added value for the real economy. Everything that drove us into the financial crisis consisted of products that added no value for the real economy. That is why it makes sense to have a tax that can be used to help ensure that this is severely penalised, that sanctions are taken, that steers us towards a situation in which capital goes back to doing its job. That is why I am advocating that we adopt this proposal today with a broad majority. Markus Ferber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must put an end to a few of the fairytales that are often told here. Fairytale number 1: austerity policies are cold and heartless and push people into social exclusion. That is not true. Austerity policies involve creating opportunities, so that future generations have the chance to do the jobs that they need to do. While the policy in some areas is sustainable, what has repeatedly been said here about financial policy is not sustainable at all. Fairytale number 2: eurobonds are the solution to all our problems. In fact, eurobonds are a sweet-tasting poison. They provide those people with money under favourable terms who can no longer obtain it elsewhere under favourable terms, so that they can run up even more debts. This is why we must categorically reject eurobonds. Fairytale number 3: all our problems will be solved by a debt redemption fund. Just to make it clear what we are talking about, a debt redemption fund means that the Member States generate surpluses per se
, so that they can make use of the fund. During the repayment period, they cannot accumulate any new debts, otherwise the whole system will cease to function. We need to look more closely at the truth and the reality before we start calling for model solutions. For this reason, the only possibility for offering people lasting future prospects and for defending the European social model on an ongoing basis in competition with other economic areas is to increase our competitiveness. We will not do this by relying more heavily on the state. Instead, we need to give companies the opportunity to invest money, for example, by selling building plots where people know that what they build on the plot will belong to them, as an illustration of the problem in Greece, and where they know that the state will not constantly be intervening with non-tariff trade barriers to limit their growth, as an illustration of the problem in France. We can only increase our competitiveness by overcoming the challenges on global markets and Germany is a good example of this. Markus Ferber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should stop acting as if we can save the world every time we get together in Strasbourg. Once again, we have a proposal on the table, and once again we are saving the world, the climate, our resources and who knows what else – even though we have already done it before elsewhere. It makes no sense to do the same thing over and over again. That is why I want to state very clearly that it makes no sense – as the Commissioner has said – to burden aviation, where we have a functioning emissions certificate trading system that we hope will also soon be effective internationally, with an additional tax. It makes no sense to include shipping, which has ideal alternative options, in this tax. It makes no sense to engineer a compromise between energy density and CO2
 emissions. Excuse me for saying so, but as an engineer, I must point out that high energy density means lower CO2 
emissions per kilometre travelled. Penalising this correlation twice is equally non-sensical. I therefore have to say that the Commission proposal has not been fully thought out. What the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs approved by a majority – against the wishes of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – only makes a half-baked proposal worse still. There is not the slightest chance that unanimity will be achieved in the Council of Ministers. That is why we need to be honest here in the European Parliament and say that we reject the report. We need to throw out this proposal. It is half-baked, unusable, and there are better ways of saving the world than through tax legislation. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Mr Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, once again, the Heads of State or Government are meeting to discuss growth, employment and competitiveness and to exchange papers on these subjects without actually taking any action. I can remember papers on the topic of youth unemployment at the end of the 1990s which identified that some Member States had lower levels of youth unemployment and others had higher levels, and which explained that it would be a good idea to look at what those countries with low rates were doing. Fourteen years have now passed and nothing has happened. When people say that we need to show solidarity, I would like to remind them that in the last 31 years, Greece has received more than EUR 100 billion from the Structural Funds. That is an expression of European solidarity. It has repeatedly been said that the money can be used, for example, to fund education and training, in particular for young people. I can remember initiatives in the region which I come from that involved attempts to introduce the dual educational system in different areas of Greece. However, this did not work. The energy revolution is still in progress in Greece and this and many other things could be financed using money from the Structural Funds. This demonstrates Europe’s solidarity. However, we also need to increase the pressure to ensure that the funds made available by the European Union are used for the purposes which will be discussed during the spring summit. Otherwise, this will once again be a summit with lots of interesting papers but no concrete results. Markus Ferber  (PPE
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Ferreira, I specifically referred to the European Union Structural Funds. However, I would like to ask for understanding on this point. If this funding had been spent in the same way as the Federal Republic of Germany used the money from the Marshall Plan, you would not need a rescue package today. Markus Ferber  (PPE
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to be a little bit more honest again in this debate. What was the situation like before the euro was introduced? What were the interest rates like in Greece when it still had the drachma? What were the rates in Italy when it had the lira, or in Spain with the peseta and Portugal with the escudo? They were considerably higher than what has to be paid on the financial markets at the moment. Those Member States within the euro enjoyed the sweet poison of low interest rates for a decade, and pursued a spending policy that they are no longer on top of. For them to now say that they want to continue to enjoy that sweet poison via the introduction of Eurobonds is precisely the wrong reaction to have. Many mistakes were made here in the past that now need to be corrected. Anyone who believes that this problem would be solved by making the drug that is low interest rates available on a sustained basis would be taking away the pressure that, thank goodness, is currently being applied to a number of Member States by the financial markets. As a second issue, I would point out that Europe would not be made healthy where the result of Eurobonds would be not to make the sick healthy, but to make the healthy sick. That is why we need to be honest on this issue, too. Eurobonds would not strengthen the European Union, they would weaken it. Then we have the craziest proposal of all in this resolution, namely to engineer a kind of self-funding reduction of debts through new debts via a redemption fund. What world are we living in? In real terms, what that means is that the debts that countries have run up would be refinanced thanks to the creditworthiness of others, with the costs being borne by those who kept their finances in order in that they have to pay higher interest rates for those who failed to do likewise. That is the communitarisation of debts. Anyone introducing this as a policy instrument endangers Europe much, much more than what we have currently put in place in connection with the rescue packages. I can therefore but warn against acting as if Eurobonds would enable us to solve all our problems. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Markus Ferber  (PPE

 Ms Goulard, I will just say, briefly, that that is not a judgment that I have put forward here. I would just point out that the last government bonds issued by Italy before it joined the euro bore an interest rate of 10%. There was no outcry in Italy at the time. Nobody said that other countries should take on the debt. It was natural for Italy to pay high interest rates. Yet now, all of a sudden, because we have had low interest rates for 10 years and got up to our ears in debt, because money was cheap – for investments just as for the public purse – we want to prolong that through Eurobonds. That represents a trap from which we will not escape, and I stand by what I said. Markus Ferber,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to join in thanking our rapporteur and all those who worked on the report because this is certainly not a routine task, even if this is the fortieth time we have dealt with competition policy on the basis of a report from the Commission. I would like to thank the Commissioner for his very comprehensive presentation – 2010 was, of course, the first year in which you had full responsibility for competition policy. Turning to something you mentioned yourself, I would like to ask that some practices in the area of public aid in the banking sector should be eradicated because the new stress tests required by the European banking supervision system indicate a need for further recapitalisation for the banks. I do not believe that it will contribute anything to the stability of the banking system if we still have a large number of unresolved or outstanding old cases on the one hand, while new cases are being created on the other because pressure is increasing to raise the equity capital quota accordingly, particularly in the area of private banks. Hence my urgent plea to you, Commissioner, to find a swift solution that will help stabilise the banking sector so that it can withstand the challenges of the international environment. The second major issue, the control of mergers, will continue to concern us increasingly in the years ahead. Here, too, I can only urge you to continue on the clear and transparent path taken by the Commission to date within the framework of merger control. It is in the interests of all involved, particularly the consumer, that we should ensure that competition is possible in the area of merger control, whether in larger or other structures, which is not for me to judge. With this in mind, I would like to thank all those who have been involved. I hope, Commissioner, that we will find a solution soon, particularly in the banking sector. Markus Ferber  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I can only agree with all of those who have congratulated the Council Presidency. Not only were you an honest broker during a difficult time; you were also a European broker. That was very nice to see during these difficult times in which we are seeing political trends in a number of Member States that suggest to the people that it would be possible to achieve more alone than together. You focused on what unites us. It was also very refreshing to see that, with this clear European agenda, you also received the support of the people in Poland on domestic policy matters. That was not particularly easy in this context. Therefore, I have the highest respect for what you have achieved. In this six-month period, we were also able to get a few things under way in the area of financial market regulation. Allow me to highlight just one area in which I was able to join in the negotiations myself, namely, the question of the regulation of short selling and naked credit default swaps in connection with government bonds, where the Commission did not have the confidence to propose a stringent regulation and with regard to which all the Member States said that we would not succeed, and where, thanks to the Polish Presidency, we did succeed in imposing sanctions against a highly speculative instrument and, where necessary, prohibiting it, so that we could help to bring greater stability to the financial markets. I would particularly like to thank your Finance Minister and the Secretary of State, who got this off the ground during a difficult discussion process between Parliament and the Council. That is an example that shows that we can do something together in the interests of security and stability in Europe. I would like to express my sincere thanks for that. Markus Ferber  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Dowgielewicz, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, we ought to focus once again on our task here today. I have now listened to eight speakers and eight different solutions. That demonstrates the problem that we have here in this House. I am, of course, pleased that there is a more united approach in the Council and that things can be brought together more quickly than the many proposals that we have now heard from the various political groups. If we need to be clear about one thing, however, then it is that we need to make immediate and united efforts to put in order what the Member States have so far prevented us from sorting out. It was easy for the US to establish a European regulation because the country already had institutions at a Federal level. We needed jointly to establish these first, and we have done that together as Parliament, even in the face of opposition, for example, from the United Kingdom. By tightening up the Stability and Growth Pact with the Governance Package, we have shown that we are capable of action here and are able to strengthen Europe to enable it to function. However, Mr Barroso, I also have a very strong point of criticism: we cannot now talk about accelerated procedures if we still have no proposals from the Commission for the majority of the necessary regulations. We are waiting for the regulation of financial markets and the Market Abuse Directive to name but two, which will probably not be tabled until next week. We cannot adopt something that is not even on the table! Therefore, my sincere request is for the Commission to press forward with these matters. All of this was intended to be done in the first half of this year. It is now October! You cannot accuse Parliament of not doing its job. We are genuinely doing everything possible to find appropriate solutions. Therefore, please table the proposals and then we will adopt them. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add my thanks for the clear affirmation you have given to the European project, Mr Tusk. I believe that now, in the 21st century, it makes sense to make a concerted effort to address problems that one country cannot resolve on its own and to find a good solution in the interest of our citizens. Thank you very much for your clear expression of commitment in this area. The tasks facing you in the second half of 2011 are enormous. The key one has already been mentioned, namely, the Greek rescue. I believe that it is right and proper that the European Union should take the lead here, rather than allowing the credit rating agencies to set the pace and direction for our actions. We shall also have to adjust our internal mechanisms if we are to remain capable of action and ensure stability. Unfortunately, Mr Farage has left us, but I would appreciate it if continuous attacks on our common currency from within the European Union would stop, even from those who are not part of the currency union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to answer this question. If we continue with this debate for the next few years, then the Americans will decide on the world’s environmental protection, the Chinese will dictate consumer protection and Europeans will have no protections whatsoever. Our job is to work for the people. (Applause)
 I wanted to briefly point out that we also have a number of problems to resolve in the area of the regulation of the financial markets, both in terms of the governance package and in relation to financial services. I look forward to working with you and hope that we Europeans can play a significant role in stabilising the financial markets. We have a particular duty in this regard and I am optimistic that we will succeed admirably under the Polish Presidency. Markus Ferber,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is right for us to debate this important proposal from the Commission here in plenary today and for us to lay down our position as the European Parliament tomorrow, because discussions in recent weeks – with all respect to the Hungarian Presidency, which has tried very hard to bring the Council and Parliament closer together on this – have shown that the Council of Ministers still needs to be motivated into adopting rules that allow what is necessary, but which prohibit what is not necessary. Let me say quite plainly that I can hardly stand to hear the word liquidity any more. If there was one problem that was to blame for leading us into the financial crisis, it was that there was too much liquidity that was invested in products that nobody needs and which then collapsed and took us into the crisis. I ask you therefore: who is it that needs insurance against a government defaulting on its commitments? Only those that hold such government securities, and they should indeed have it. Anyone speculating on a country being unable to meet its commitments, however, should not be able to use such instruments to do so. That is why these products must be prohibited. When it comes to the short selling of shares – in other words, selling shares that one does not have – it is a matter of drawing up rules that prevent highly speculative behaviour. I believe we have achieved a reasonable compromise here, and in this respect discussions with the Council have been very constructive. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding work. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive discussions, and also the Commission, which has played a very positive part in achieving this. Moreover, I hope that, for its part, the Council – which is unfortunately not represented here today – will be able to agree a sensible resolution of this matter with us as soon as possible. With that in mind, I am pleased that we – as Parliament – are now sending out a clear signal as regards this important dossier. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is actually about innovative financing, but we have already heard something about that. Innovation does not simply mean inventing new taxes or re-labelling what has always been there, such as national debt. I would like to concentrate very briefly on what this debate is really about. It is not about the introduction of Eurobonds – and the CDU/CSU parties will certainly speak out against that – but rather it is about learning the lessons of the crisis in the financial markets, and that means quite simply that speculation must be taxed too. It also means – and I will state this quite clearly – that if this cannot be done worldwide at the G20, then we must do it at European Union level. There is no alternative; that is why I am not simply looking for applause now, Mr Bullmann, but for a clear, strong vote by the European Parliament tomorrow. In this, Commissioner, the Commission must act as our ally against the Member States – particularly against the Member State that we have just heard speaking so loudly about what the City of London thinks. I will simply say to you, Mr Farage: look at the unemployment figures and look at the economic decline of your country, which has concentrated on financial market products. If you still built cars – as we do in Bavaria and in Germany – then you would be doing somewhat better now. That is why the financial transaction tax must be called for and introduced now as a matter of urgency. It is our duty as Europeans. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).

 Madam President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that today is a good day, not only for the European institutions, but also for the people of Europe, because we have succeeded, two years after the collapse of the Lehman bank, in creating a structure that, although not eliminating all of the problems that could arise in the financial market, will help to make the excesses that have occurred in the financial market no longer possible in the European Union. We can be proud of ourselves for this. I would like to express my thanks to the Belgian Presidency, because we had the feeling – and I can endorse what Mrs Goulard said – that the Council was not making much of an effort in this regard at the beginning. Although the Council adopted a unanimous resolution at first, it did not solve the problems. It was thanks to the European Parliament that a solution was found across the group divides which is truly viable and which will ensure that we have stable supervisory structures as well as a range of instruments that can be used in crisis situations to stem excesses and thus help to stabilise the financial sector. I would like to thank you most sincerely, Mr Reynders, as you have personally shown a great deal of commitment to this matter. However, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the Commission, which ensured that, in a fair dialogue, the two positions represented by the Council and Parliament, which were very far apart to start with, could be brought together. Thank you very much. That gives us hope with regard to further legislation. Markus Ferber,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the second and third Postal Services Directive, I am, of course, particularly pleased that this subject is also on the agenda during this parliamentary term, because I believe it is also important to show what we have achieved since we tabled the Green Paper in 1992, as the Commissioner mentioned. We have managed to significantly improve the quality of postal services throughout Europe. I can still remember that, two parliamentary terms ago, I said in this Chamber that it was usual for holidaymakers to arrive home before the postcards they had sent home to their loved ones. That situation has now changed. We have achieved a significant improvement in the quality of cross-border postal services. We have achieved a significant improvement in the quality of postal services within the Member States. With the obligation for a universal service that is uniform throughout Europe, we have also managed to significantly improve the availability of postal services, or in areas where it was already good, we were able to maintain this level. That is also important, and it was mentioned by both the Commissioner and our committee chair. Of course, in implementing the third directive, which for the majority of Member States specifies 1 January 2011 as the date for complete liberalisation, it is now important to safeguard this universal service on a permanent basis. I would like to emphasise what is stated in the question regarding the simultaneous requirement – and that was the Conditio sine qua non
 for the third directive – that it should not result in a deterioration in working conditions, but that existing social standards and protection mechanisms should continue to apply in the Member States beyond 1 January 2011. We will, of course, ensure that this is the case. We will not only have the oral question today, but the Commission also has obligations to provide us with reports. We will read these reports very carefully, Commissioner, and if necessary we will also formulate the appropriate conclusions. Markus Ferber,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, one could wonder what we have actually now achieved after a year spent in discussions, debates and many sessions in the trialogue, and I could have certainly imagined doing something nicer than spending my time there. One year on from the European elections, when we announced in public how we wanted to bring the finance markets into line, we are now at a point where our success rate ranges from very little to none at all. The problem has already been explained. We are dealing with markets which operate globally nowadays. Member States still believe that they can use their national supervisory structures to apply rules in this environment. The fact that this did not work was not what actually triggered the financial crisis, but it contributed to Europe being affected by it as well. This is why I would ask when this realisation, which is often mentioned in grandiose speeches, will be converted into political action, where it is suddenly about protecting stock exchange centres and banking structures and no longer about protecting citizens. This is the task to which we have committed ourselves as the European Parliament. I hope that Member States will commit themselves to this task, too, because we share the responsibility for implementing proper supervision regulations for citizens, which will ensure that individuals’ savings are also permanently secure. I would of course hope – and I am now addressing the Commissioners – that every effort will now be made by the Commission so that we can achieve a good outcome as quickly as possible, for the benefit of people living in Europe. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).  
– (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is this all about then? The question is quite simply how can the financial markets help to reduce the costs that they have incurred for states, societies and the economy? That is the crucial question that we must answer. I think that together, we have developed a very balanced text. I am also very grateful to the Commissioner for the way he has worded it. On the one hand, we cannot pretend that Europe is the Island of the Blessed where we can do what we like without the global financial markets reacting to it. Things must be coordinated internationally. On the other hand, we must also ensure that the sector makes an appropriate contribution to overcoming the crisis. That is why I would caution that we must stop coming up with a new item every week that we can use to solve all the problems of the world. A couple of months ago, it was an additional levy on airline tickets that was going to solve all our problems, now it is the tax on financial transactions and next month, somebody will think of something else. That is going too far. It is a question of involving the financial markets in an internationally coordinated manner. If a sensible solution to this can be put forward by the Commission and introduced into international negotiations, then we will be on the right track. We should also be honest with ourselves. Those who maintain that we can stop speculation with such instruments are clearly deluding themselves. What we want is for speculators to make their contribution to the risk and to overcoming the risk. That is the right approach. In doing so, you have our full support Commissioner. Markus Ferber  (PPE
).

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to begin with, it is right that common procedures should go with a common currency. It is right to consider how these common procedures, which have not yet been implemented everywhere in the Single Euro Payments Area, might be enforced a little better. On the other hand, I will say quite clearly that we still have to adapt the rulebook in a few places. I myself come from a country where the direct debit procedure is a very widespread procedure, in order to facilitate the processing of certain regular payments. The procedure that is currently planned in the rulebook is a very bureaucratic, very complicated procedure and therefore, I would be very pleased, Commissioner, if, with regard to a final date – something we all want – this area in particular is tackled once again. On the one hand, there should be no vulnerability to fraud – that is a problem in the cross-border area – but on the other hand, it should also be possible for local charges to be debited, and for any magazine subscription, any insurance premium, any mobile phone bill, and so on to continue to be collected in a simple procedure by the companies concerned. That is my request and there is also a corresponding passage in our motion for a resolution on this subject, so that we can contribute to ensuring that procedures that have proved successful in the Member States can also be guaranteed after the final introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area.

 Madam President, Commission President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, what is tomorrow’s vote all about? It is about doing what many people in this House cannot do and others do not want to do. It is, in fact, about taking responsibility for Europe. I would like to highlight one point. Mr Barroso, I am very grateful to you for mentioning this again in your interruption. It is about taking responsibility for Europe’s ability to act during a difficult time, in order to overcome all the problems which have been the subject of justified criticism from citizens and also from this Parliament. I believe that today’s debate has helped to clarify the issue of whom Europe can and cannot rely on in future when it comes to taking political responsibility in the years to come. However, I would like to point out, Mr Barroso, that there is, of course, a whole series of subjects on the agenda which need to be dealt with and you have a great deal of responsibility in this area because you have a monopoly on launching initiatives at a European level. I would like to look at one more subject which seems to me not to have been covered in sufficient detail in the debate so far and that is agricultural policy. In this area, we are faced with several new challenges. It is not enough simply to mention the fact that the agriculture ministers came to a resolution in the autumn of last year. It is not enough that we have begun a programme of comprehensive agricultural reform, because when the basic conditions change, you must, of course, take a corresponding initiative to help farmers in the European Union. My request is that you take the Commissioner for Agriculture on one side and point out to her that her model will not succeed in guiding this important sector out of the crisis. We are prepared, and I am speaking on behalf of my colleagues here, to take over responsibility for Europe in the interests of the European Union and the people of Europe. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Along with a large majority in Parliament, I have voted against the ACTA. Today it is a case of ACTA ad acta
. Tomorrow it will be a new start for increased market protection. In its current form, the ACTA was beset with too many errors and a lack of clarity. It confused people and resulted in a large amount of public pressure in the social networks and new media, the latter being something positive. I also still find it annoying that for years the ACTA was kept secret and was only made public at a late stage following intensive pressure from the European Parliament. We MEPs were expected to rubber stamp everything in a fast-track procedure. That is not acceptable. Many mistakes were made that we can only correct by making a completely new start. The clear ‘no’ to ACTA is, for me, an unqualified ‘yes’ to global protection against ‘commercial-scale counterfeiting and piracy’, which is actually the key concern of the agreement. Without effective, global coordination of copyright protection, Europe has a great deal to lose. Intellectual property is Europe’s most valuable raw material. Our decision today clears the way for the development of a new, better and transparent agreement under European leadership. This process can and must take place in dialogue with all ‘stakeholders’ – with the focus on people and ethics. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, there is a German rhyme: Ein kleines Dorf im Frankenland ist durch sein gutes Bier bekannt
, which tells of regional pride in a brewery, and this demonstrates a problem that we have created today. If this brewery or its distributor is 107 kilometres away from where I live, then in future, it will no longer be able to supply me with its products unless it buys a new tachograph and complies with new red tape. That is why I voted against this resolution today, because in my view, we should not be overburdening our small and medium-sized enterprises. There are many points that we have managed to incorporate which were positive. After all, it was planned that a radius of just 50 kilometres should be accepted for regional suppliers. The Commission was being quite absurd there. A distance of 100 kilometres may be just about feasible. However, what if the distance is more than this? I therefore consider it to be excessive. One final aspect: as a representative of an employees’ organisation in the German CSU party, I would also say that this regulation represents complete control of workers. Why? It is because the entire working day of those distributing construction materials or drinks from the breweries is completely controlled via GPS. For data protection reasons, too, therefore, I feel that what we have decided today is highly questionable, and I emphasise once again why I voted against it. Martin Kastler  (PPE

Madam President, I voted against the Ferreira report for a number of reasons. Reading our newspapers in Germany – only today, one of the big dailies says that the German chancellor is asking whether anybody still sticks to the rules in Europe, or they say that Cyprus is the next candidate for a bailout – I ask myself: ‘What next?’. Just as the previous speaker said that after the ‘six-pack’ comes the ‘two-pack’, I believe that after the ‘two-pack’ will come the ‘zero-pack’, because we no longer know how it is actually supposed to work. I am very concerned that we, the elected representatives, will be the last to find out the secret plan that the European Commission and the institutions have for how we carry on with Europe. I am firmly convinced that in the future, we will have to consider how we carry on at all. The mood among the population of my constituency is so bad that it is clear: we want to help, but we also want to have rules, and those rules should be adhered to and checked. I cannot therefore vote for further debt, for a Europe of debt, a transfer union, which is what we already have in many areas. I am against eurobonds. I am also against project bonds, because I do not think that they will help us to act usefully in this area in the future and make progress together. I hope, however, that at some point, the European institutions will tell us transparently and openly about this so-called secret plan, so that we find out what it involves. Martin Kastler,

 Mr President, Mr De Gucht, your statement was very informative. Thank you very much. Sometimes, figures say more than words. Up to this point, as you have mentioned, the European Patent Office has granted almost 2 000 patents for plants and almost 1 200 patents for animals created with and without the use of genetic engineering. I would like to mention two prominent examples. The first is the approval of patents on barley which has been genetically modified and modified by breeding. This applies to the entire chain from the seed through to the plant and, therefore, affects both our farmers and our brewers, both producers and consumers. This example shows the devastating scope of the patenting processes. The second example concerns the so-called long-life tomato, which is not to be confused with the long-life oil in the engines of your diesel cars. The ploy used by the applicant, the US company Arcadia, enabled it to obtain a patent by circumventing current EU regulations. It was not the tomato that was patented, but its genetic material, in this case, selected enzymes. This shows the lengths that companies will go to, despite the fact that, as you have said, Mr De Gucht, Article 4 of the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions of 1998 clearly states: The following shall not be patentable: (a) plant and animal varieties; (b) essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals. We are of the opinion that this definition should be made more precise. Technical processes used to support conventional breeding activities must not lead to patentability. We would like to make it quite clear that there must be no patents on life. We need to send out a clear signal that there needs to be a more ethical approach and greater honesty with regard to creation. I repeat: we are opposed to the patentability of life throughout Europe. Therefore, Mr De Gucht, we are calling for a clear statement from the Commission that patents on genetic material and genetic resources are, and will remain, banned. Secondly, we are calling for a clear position on Article 4 of the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions: no patents on life. Thirdly, Mr De Gucht, on behalf of many farmers and breeders in Europe, we are calling for the breeders’ and farmers’ privilege to be clearly enshrined in all legislation. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Today, I have voted in favour of the resolution on the Statute for a European cooperative society with regard to the involvement of employees. It is good that we are focusing specifically on the subject of cooperatives in the European Parliament, as this is the International Year of Cooperatives. In the European Union, there are around 160 000 cooperatives, which are owned by more than a quarter of all Europeans and employ about 5.4 million people. In my home region of Bavaria alone, there are over 1 200 cooperatives and cooperative enterprises with more than 2.7 million members. Cooperatives are one of the cornerstones of our economy. Their achievements are even more obvious in times of crisis, because cooperatives involve taking joint responsibility. For example, during the financial crisis, cooperative banks demonstrated how sustainable and resilient they are as a result of their cooperative business model. They have not lost billions in the crisis like other banks. On the contrary, their balance sheets show an increase in revenue and growth. They provide 5.4 million high-quality, crisis-proof jobs throughout Europe. Cooperatives have their roots in the regions where they are located. They represent a model for the future, for our regions and for Europe. If we promote the cooperative model as part of EU development policy, we can make a contribution which will really help people, actively involve them and encourage them to be independent. We need more incentives for cooperatives. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I can only support what my colleague, Mr Posselt, has already said: Strasbourg is the capital of Europe, the seat of the European Parliament. I propose that we should close Brussels, that we stop shuttling back and forth between Brussels and Strasbourg, and that we finally invest here. We own the buildings here, but not the ones in Brussels. This is the seat of Parliament. I have to ask myself: we entertain so many visitors here in Strasbourg every month. We explain how Europe works to them. Why are we building a Parliamentarium, a museum of European history, in Brussels? That belongs here in Strasbourg. It is for this reason that I voted against this report. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I have voted against the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the feasibility of introducing stability bonds. The name has been changed, but the content remains the same. These are Eurobonds. We have now reached a stage in Europe where we need to ask ourselves the fundamental question of how Europe is to go forward. The Italian Prime Minister, Mr Monti, said today in a guest article in Germany that we need to ‘rethink democracy’. To this, I would add that we must ‘rethink Europe’. We must do this if we want to carry the citizens of Europe along with us. I believe that referendums are an important instrument. We need citizens to become increasingly involved in Europe, not only in the Member States, but also at a European level. This will enable us to discuss the major issues currently facing us which have led us into this crisis. It will take us further forward than simply tabling new motions for resolutions to distribute ever larger debts among ourselves. Every country is responsible for its own debts. We should not be transferring debts from one state to another. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me preface my remarks by saying that I am also greatly in favour of freedom of movement and I believe that it is a really important achievement for the European Union that we can move around this single market freely in the service sectors, indeed in all sectors. However, there is also a principle that applies not just within the European Union, but also under the rule of law, namely: pacta sunt servanda
 – treaties are to be honoured. According to the Treaty, a clause applies to the free movement of workers, setting down a period of three years, plus two years, plus two years. Accordingly, I was unable to support this resolution today, as it is just a symbol of a willingness to alter treaties while they are still in force. In my opinion, it should be up to the Member States themselves to decide. This is what it says in the Treaties. That was correct. Nonetheless, when the Treaties lapse and all restrictions run out, there will be no wave of mass migration to the old Member States from the other Member States. I am absolutely convinced that it is by working together that we will achieve progress in the European Union and that no more barriers should be imposed. Martin Kastler  (PPE

Madam President, I was happy to vote in favour of the report on the mid-term review of the strategy of the European Union for occupational health and safety today. I would like to emphasise three points that I consider particularly important. The first is paragraph 82, which we approved today. I would have preferred it if we had given an even clearer signal in regard to work-life balance, everything relating to occupational health and how we regulate work, the rhythm we provide workers with, including, above all, the protection of Sundays as a day of rest. I myself have launched an initiative in this regard and I believe we can all play our part in supporting March 3 next year as a Europe-wide day for Sunday as a day of rest. I also believe paragraph 16 is particularly important. After all, burnout is one of the illnesses that generates the highest costs in Europe. We urgently need a burnout strategy, and next year the European Commission is to publish a relevant study, as well as holding out the prospect of a Green Paper. This is something we urgently need to discuss in Europe. Finally, as the rapporteur for the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations 2012, I would like to make the following call: let us work together in Europe to ensure we respect everyone, both workers and employers alike, in health, vitality and dignity.

I voted against this report today. No one could disagree with the common objective of the EU Member States of halving the number of road traffic fatalities. Almost 100 people are still dying on Europe’s roads every day. The goal is clear – the question is how to get there. Transport policy is, and remains, a national, regional and partly local issue. Successes are only achieved if they are closely based on the reality of people’s lives. Europe is not the right arena for this. Even if all the proposals were scientifically based, this is still not a matter for the EU. The best example of this is the scientifically-based proposal that, in future, children under three years of age should only travel in secure, rear-facing car seats. As a young father, I am well aware that no child aged two or three will want to sit facing backwards on the rear seat. What is more, drivers can no longer see their children, so who knows what might happen. This own-initiative report is superfluous. Signals like this are counter-productive, particularly in the current climate of crisis. We must concentrate on essentials. Martin Kastler,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, next year will be the first year in which there will be more retired people than workers in Europe. This is a major turning point in Europe. It is a good sign that we are today voting to make the year 2012 the European Year for Active Ageing and for solidarity between generations, and we will also duly celebrate it and present it to the public. At this point, I would like to thank the Commission, the Council and the shadow rapporteurs most sincerely for the fact that we were able to reach a compromise together at first reading, and this is the compromise that we are presenting here today and will jointly adopt. I would like to refer you to an amendment that I would ask you to support. A European Year also requires a certain amount of publicity and for that we also need money. We have fought for a budget line for this so that a certain amount is available in order to present to the public the subject of solidarity between generations as well as the subject of active ageing. Thank you very much and I would ask for your support. (Applause) Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have voted today on the report by Mr Goerens and I believe that this report is moving in the right direction. For the first time in the history of the European Union, we have done away with the unquestioning belief in budget support in the field of development aid. This means that for the first time we have stated in a report that we should not simply give money to administrative bodies, to states or to governments without sanctions and without criteria that can be monitored. This is the right way forward. However, in my opinion one thing is missing. This concerns an amendment which I have tabled and which was unfortunately voted down. The amendment stated that we in the European Union must impose sanctions when a state can be proved to have disregarded the criteria which form the basis for the provision of development aid. We must change this situation so that we can maintain our credibility and make it clear to our voters and our taxpayers what we are spending development aid on. Martin Kastler  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the few of you who are still here, visitors to the European Parliament, in conclusion, I would like to make some brief remarks on the subject of misleading directory companies. I have voted in favour of the resolution because it is important for us in the European Union to make our opinion clear on this. This is a part of organised crime in Europe which involves bogus companies taking money from people and from small and medium-sized businesses over the Internet. We must make every effort to prevent this from happening. The Commission has made many soapbox speeches calling for genuine support to be given to small and medium-sized companies and for the amount of red tape to be reduced. One important aspect of this is to bring an end to this type of organised crime. The resolution represents a step in the right direction, but only a small one. We must take action and, therefore, I am calling on everyone to continue with this work, not only those Members who are not here, but all of us who represent the citizens of Europe in Parliament. Martin Kastler  (PPE
),

 I voted in favour of this report as I believe that businesses have a social responsibility – towards their employees and customers, the environment and society at large. A new term has been added to the German dictionary: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). This is – and should remain – a voluntary matter. In our globalised markets, CSR entails much more than making a donation to the local football club. Businesses that operate in a globally responsible way help shape foreign policy and development policy. They are Europe’s ambassadors to the world, flying the flag for Europe’s social standards worldwide. We should support CSR, not regulate it. In this case, Europe’s role should be that of a moderator, not a regulator. This principle must be applied if the European Commission is to get serious and take up the topic of CSR once again: we do not need excessive regulation. We have underlined this position with this report. Martin Kastler  (PPE
).

Madam President, I also voted in favour of this report and of this resolution – in favour of Macedonia. However, if we are being honest about this, then there is one detail that must be mentioned. We cannot tell people and ethnic groups in other countries to rename their language because other countries do not like what they call it. That is laid down in international law, and as Europeans we must be sure that we remain honest about this. I was consequently very annoyed that unfortunately, one amendment was passed that I voted against, which stated that Macedonian should not be allowed to be called Macedonian. Macedonia is a country with great prospects in Europe mainly because it also has great economic prospects in the Balkans, a region that has genuine difficulties, is prospering economically, and is conducting the negotiations with élan – which is very positive. In view of this positive attitude, I would like to thank all the Members who voted for this resolution, as well as all those who worked with the parliament there as part of the European Parliament delegation. We should make these prospects clear to the people there who want to be part of Europe. Let us work together to that end. Martin Kastler  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I have voted in favour of the Oomen-Ruijten report and would like to emphasise two points. Firstly, when we see that in some countries in Europe too many pensions are being paid out too early, but these countries are getting into difficulties and the others are having to bail them out, that is unfair. This unfairness cannot, of course, be refinanced via the EU. We need European coordination in this regard. The second point that I am very pleased with in this report is the fact that it makes it very clear, according to the principle of subsidiarity, that the Member States themselves are responsible for pension provision. That is indeed the case. I therefore consider this report to be a step in the right direction in that, on the one hand, we in Europe are recognising that our citizens want more coordination in the social sphere because they feel unfairly treated and, on the other, we are making it clear where the main responsibility lies, namely with the Member States. This report represents a step in this direction. We will do everything possible to ensure that the White Paper continues to push ahead with this. Martin Kastler  (PPE
),

 It is shocking that Christians throughout the world continue to be persecuted and murdered. It is an indictment of Europe that the foreign ministers of the Member States in the Council cannot manage to respond to this. They treat the will of Parliament with contempt. The EU must do something. I call on the Council to show responsibility for the basic right of freedom of religion, to swiftly draw up an implementable strategy to protect Christians throughout the world and to establish a separate unit for intercultural and religious matters in the European External Action Service. These things need to be done now, not some time in the future. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Today’s vote on the European citizens’ initiative is a milestone for more democracy in Europe. I welcome the compromise and I will support it, because the report produced by Mr Lamassoure and Mrs Gurmai is the first step in the right direction. Ladies and gentlemen, we must not be afraid of citizens having more opportunities to express their will. We must give the citizens of Europe more codecision rights, not just every five years at the European elections. This needs courage, stamina and strength. Courage to keep returning to the dialogue. Stamina, because decisions cannot necessarily be made more quickly and strength because our representative democracy includes, at last, in my opinion, more participative elements. Our goal must be to increase the dialogue in Europe between the citizens and the politicians. I am pleased that we are moving one step closer to the Europe of the citizens today with the European citizens’ initiative. I am convinced that one day we Europeans will take joint European decisions, in the form of citizens’ decisions. Martin Kastler  (PPE
),

 I have voted in favour of the amendments and against the Berlinguer report, because I am not sure that it provides adequate support for subsidiarity. I do not believe that we should be able to delete important details just because this is a large package of directives. This is a strategy which will backfire. For me, the crux of the matter is paragraph 40, which, in the form that it was adopted today, together with other components of the Stockholm Programme, will provoke conflicts of jurisdiction. In specific terms, there are doubts as to whether we should use family law for the mutual recognition of civil status documents, in other words, marriage certificates, and, therefore, whether we should take into account the decision-making authority of the Member States with regard to the definition of marriage, following the procedure outlined in Article 81(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. While this remains unclear, there is a risk of a conflict between the simple procedures of civil law and the complex procedures of cross-border family law. A sentence corresponding with Amendment 3 would have been sufficient to defuse this conflict. This is a detail which, unfortunately, was not supported by the majority in Parliament today. I remain of the opinion that marriage and family life are under the specific protection of the state. They are exclusively a matter for the Member States. Therefore, I have voted against this own-initiative report. Martin Kastler  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I would like to respond briefly to what Mr Hannan has just said. It is, of course, essential for this Parliament to have a seat, but the seat is established by our treaties and it is here in Strasbourg. You are right to say that we need to save taxpayers’ money and that we must work towards being based in one place. However, the refuge of parliamentarianism, Mr Hannan, is here in Strasbourg. This is where we as Members of Parliament and representatives of the people can work together. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, the Estrela report yesterday covered a very important topic. I would like to say at this point that it was rather difficult for me to vote in favour of it. As a young father, I was present at the birth of both my children and I have to say that I do not know why I would have needed a holiday then, because I did not give birth, my wife did. This is all about maternity leave and we have included fathers. It is difficult point. Nevertheless, it is important for young women to have the opportunity to have a child and then to return to their professional life. I believe that this will be possible under the new system. Although I would personally have preferred 18 weeks, I did eventually vote in favour of 20 weeks in the final vote. We must now ask ourselves whether this will bring more justice and more children in Europe. Family policy in Europe is an issue for the future. I hope that we are sending out a signal that we have taken action in this area. Now we just have to hope that the Member States take corresponding measures. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, incarcerating people in labour camps because they do not share the same views as a governing regime is a crime against human dignity. Slave labour camps, re-education camps and internment camps – these are all anachronisms that have lost none of their repugnance in the 21st century, wherever in the world they may be. I am truly disappointed that the European Commission, against our better judgment, has failed to present any concrete measures to the Members of this House to deal with the Chinese case and has not explained how it envisages future cooperation between the EU and China. If the US has lists of businesses and if books exist publishing the names of businesses that are known to be a front for internment camps, then why is it that you do not have them? Why are you taking this blinkered approach? You and the Commission are making yourselves share in the blame for the misery suffered by those who have been imprisoned, mostly without due legal process. No one could want this. The rule of law is one of our fundamental principles in Europe and in the European Union. As an MEP, I am ashamed to have had to listen to what was said here today. Nonetheless, I am pleased, on the other hand, that we have drawn attention here to this principle of the rule of law for liberty and for human dignity on a cross-party basis. I would like to thank the House for this. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are taking a new and important step forward in the field of animal welfare by providing more protection for animals used in scientific research. We have heard a great deal about animal welfare. We have also heard that Europe is an important location for industrial research and innovation. However, there is one issue which we have not talked about enough. This concerns a fundamental value of the European Union, namely human dignity, and the question of how we handle it. I believe that we must not, on the one hand, improve animal welfare and, on the other, expose ourselves to risks in an area which, at least in part, runs counter to our European values. Why am I saying this? The European Commission has referred to alternative methods in its documents. These include five methods relating to research into and use of embryonic stem cells and, in particular, human stem cells. In my opinion, this is immoral. It is something which I cannot ignore when it comes to voting today on the proposed compromise between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Therefore, I would like to call on you and, in particular, on the Council, the Member States and the Commission, in the form of the so-called Regulatory Committee, to take a highly sensitive approach. When we show concern for human dignity, this does not mean that we are opposed to animal welfare. On the contrary, we want both of these things. We want to cooperate to protect the dignity of living creatures, whether they are animals or humans, in a way that corresponds to our European concept of dignity, so that we can work together to defend and support it. One of Europe’s trademarks is that we are prepared to fight for human freedom and dignity. For this reason, I will not be able to take part in today’s vote, because in moral terms, it is not possible for me to do one thing and ignore another. Discussing this subject today was the right thing to do, but the third dimension of human dignity has come off rather badly. Martin Kastler  (PPE

I welcome the report on the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States prepared by Mr Őry. Why is that? In this report, the European Parliament has made it very clear what we Europeans can expect in the coming years in the area of work and employment. In addition to the questions of migration and demographic change, the potential for employment in Europe in the area of the so-called ‘green economy’ is a very important issue. This potential can only be exploited successfully if there are sufficient qualified jobs available. This offers a unique opportunity for women at management level in particular. Both men and women have equal opportunities in this dynamic and still relatively new area of business, something that is sometimes more difficult in other areas. It is necessary to ensure that it is possible to balance work and family life, for example, by creating family-friendly jobs and by providing childcare facilities. It must be possible to establish individual models for working hours, as well as part-time arrangements, particularly for those in management positions. Unfortunately, this is not yet possible in all parts of Europe’s labour market. Martin Kastler,

 Mr President, in 2007 and 2008, Libya voted against the United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for a moratorium on executions, and the repeated questioning by human rights organisations elicited no official statements either. It is therefore very important to us that the names of the people who have been executed are now officially revealed at last. Any execution is one too many. We condemn the use of executions and the death penalty. They are inhumane and cruel, and any execution is one too many. In our resolution, therefore, we clearly ask that we change this situation and bring it to light and that we now work together to bring about a change here. No more underreporting. Instead we want transparent information on what happens here and a humane penalty for genuine criminals, but no excessive punishment for those who criticise the regime in Tripoli. Martin Kastler  (PPE

Madam President, around 75% to 80% of all those suffering religious persecution worldwide are Christians. We in the European Parliament are fighting specifically for human rights throughout the world. For me, religious freedom is a central concept of our human rights policy. Therefore, I regret that those on the left and the liberal left in the European Parliament often join together to keep silent about the fate of Christians. At the same time, I am pleased that we are jointly tabling a resolution today about the dreadful situation in Pakistan. Of the 156 million people in Pakistan, 95% are Muslims, around 3% Christians and around 2% Hindus. As a Christian, I would like to focus once again on the situation of the Pakistani Christians, who are subjected to severe persecution. Anyone who allows violent attacks on Christians to take place must receive a response from the civilised world. Therefore, the EU should introduce a criterion in its development policy and economic cooperation which covers this issue and allows sanctions to be applied if necessary. Martin Kastler  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I have voted in favour of this report and I would like to congratulate Mr Mikolášik on the excellent work he has done. I believe that today is an important day, because we have ensured that donors and recipients of organs will have consistent standards and greater safety.

 Mr President, the citizens of Europe are right. They like honest foods and they like honest politicians. I respect public opinion of this kind. We cannot simply ignore public opinion and we cannot simply dismiss it as populism. That is not the case. We must take notice of what our citizens are saying to us. If our constituents and our citizens are of the opinion that real meat must be real meat and that it must not be made of pieces of meat glued together, then we must make sure that it is not possible for meat to be processed in this way. This is why I have voted against allowing thrombin to be used as a food glue. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted against this report for two reasons. Firstly, I am disturbed that Europe is increasingly taking a scatter-gun approach to development policy and that more and more resolutions and requests are encouraging this approach. Secondly, I have voted against the report, because I believe it is a bad thing for us to try to impose family planning policy on developing and emerging countries in the form of a sort of cultural imperialism. Abortion is not a solution and I regret the fact that some Members of the European Parliament refer euphemistically to ‘reproductive medicine’ when they mean abortion. This does not change the fact that abortion means killing an unborn child. Therefore, I have voted against this report and I hope that in future, we will not use the same euphemistic terms in every resolution and own-initiative report to describe aspects of cultural imperialism. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of those people who has brought one of the first citizens’ initiative petitions into being, specifically, on the subject of protecting Sundays. Today, we have the pleasure of debating – and then deciding upon – a potential way of involving the citizens in the process of Europe’s political work. That means that this is a potential way to bring about more democracy and to counter Europe-fatigue. That said, I am not here just to give praise. Rather, I have two requests to make of you, when you now take this Regulation into its final phase. Firstly, we Europeans are technologically advanced people. I would like to ask you to make the Internet the definitive medium so that a citizens’ initiative with a million signatures is also admissible with electronic signatures, which are also legally binding. Secondly, I would like to point out that what we are doing here is just a first step. I would like to go a step further. We now have a right of initiative for the citizens. It would be my wish, however, for us to also have referendums, as we have in my home region of Bavaria, at the European level in future. What happens is that there is a petition for a referendum, then, when enough people have put their name to it, there is the possibility of a referendum. It would be my wish that we should also have this in Europe. Martin Kastler,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is regrettable that a number of States around the world still, in this day and age, conduct or permit this inhumane kind of punishment for serious criminals. I believe that nobody has the right to decide about the life or death of another person, be it at the beginning or the end of that life, and certainly not in connection with punishing a criminal act. This barbaric punishment by execution has no place in the modern world. The unforgettable, great Pope John Paul II pointed out that, above all, atonement, the chance for reconciliation, must be possible. With an irreversible act such as the death penalty, that is not possible. That is why, as parliamentary groups, we are joining forces to call on our colleagues in South Korea to take up this subject in their parliament and to join with us Europeans to campaign for the abolition of the death penalty, as a mark of humanity. I would like to call on all Members to support this joint motion for a resolution unanimously. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say on behalf of part of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and, above all, on behalf of my colleague, Elmar Brok, that we are shocked that the House has today rejected the amendment which would have included Christians and other religious minorities in this report. I think it is truly outrageous that, although we are constantly making statements on human rights issues, we do not believe it is worth protecting parts of the population who are being persecuted because of their religious background. It is a great pity that we could not accept the amendment which concerns a subject that is of great importance for the future of the world. If we are not able to protect minorities for whatever reason, we no longer have the right to claim that the European Parliament is the home of human rights, of fundamental rights and of this struggle throughout the world. I have voted against this, because religious minorities should not be excluded. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am somewhat surprised that, in this House, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) stands accused of forcing this topic, which, although urgent, is probably not to the liking of any member of the Left majority of this House, onto the agenda. I doubt that they constitute a majority in this House. I simply had to ask that question. Like all the other groups, our group is also perfectly entitled to raise this matter. Even though Mr Chávez, who is currently in power, might be some kind of chum of yours or of the previous Spanish Presidency-in-Office, we still simply have to ask what action is being taken in this regard. I am quite amazed that somebody like Mr Chávez can possibly say things like ‘Twitter is a terrorist system’. I am sorry, but anyone in this day and age who describes Twitter as a terrorist system is living in another world, back in the stone age. Let me tell you this, as well: We, the PPE Group, will not be cowed by this accusation. We denounce violations of human rights everywhere. I personally denounce human rights violations when it comes to freedom of the press. On that score, let me just say that Venezuelan journalists are spoon-fed and dictated to and that judges are thrown into jail if they release someone who has been wrongly arrested. As Europeans, we must have the courage to speak out against such practices. I will not allow Mrs de Keyser and others in this House to pin this accusation on the PPE Group. Like anyone else, we are perfectly entitled to designate violations of human rights and freedoms, whether in Europe or anywhere else across the world, as topics worthy of debate. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, I would just like to draw your attention to the fact that all the groups have endorsed this motion for a resolution. That is as it should be, because this topic is very important. In contrast to the previous speakers, I would like to say that we must ensure that we do not merely promote freedom of expression and freedom of the press in this country, but that we also actively demand them, now that we are examining ways that we could help things proceed towards a, hopefully, peaceful election. We have to ensure that we, as Europeans, establish freedom of the press in all areas, with all the financial assistance that is needed to make that possible. We also have to provide full support and endeavour to act together to provide financial assistance, within the scope of the agreements which we have with this country. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 It is commendable that the new Macedonian democracy has made further progress in all areas of society and business. I very much welcome the fact that the presidential and local elections in March 2009 went smoothly. This is an indication of the growing democratisation throughout the entire region which was reflected in Macedonia. Macedonia has met all the criteria for liberalising the visa regulations and, therefore, from 19 December 2009 onwards, its citizens have visa-free status. This represents a major step forward. However, Macedonia still has a number of reforms to implement. I very much hope that we can use the experience which we gathered during the first phase of the eastern enlargement of the EU to help it in this process. In this context, I am thinking of the implementation of institutional reforms, where political foundations and a range of different NGOs have achieved so much. There are two areas where we should strengthen our cooperation with regard to transformation and EU standards. These are reform in the public administration, in the judiciary and in the police. Personally, I would like to see the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece put aside in the immediate future. It is important that progress towards the unification of Europe is not brought to a standstill because of bilateral disagreements. Martin Kastler,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the massacre on 23 November of last year in the Province of Maguindanao in the Philippines was a black day for human rights and a barbaric act of terrorism. Fifty seven people were killed, women were raped, people were injured – they convey a bloody message. As a journalist, it struck me, in particular, that there were 30 journalists among those killed. According to the renowned International Crisis Group, in no other case on record have more journalists ever been murdered at one time. For this reason, it is appropriate for the European Parliament to make a clear statement, as we are doing today in this draft resolution. However, as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we request that the present text be toned down in three places through a split vote, because we ought to support the Philippine Government in its fight against terrorism and violence and therefore dispense with overly accusatory remarks directed at the government. Therefore, on behalf of the PPE Group, I request a separate vote on recital F. This accuses the Philippines of showing all the signs of a non-functional legal system. In paragraph 2, we would like to delete the insinuation about what are referred to as initial delays in the investigation. Finally, in paragraph 6, it is claimed that some missing persons are locked away in Philippine prisons. This, too, is currently an unproven insinuation and should, in our opinion, be deleted.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be voting in favour of this report, as I think that the deepening of cooperation between the European Union and the ACP states within the framework of the partnership agreements is important. That said, I would like to point out that this report contains the wording ‘protection of sexual and reproductive health’. Yet what is behind this phrase? Does it, first of all, mean ensuring people’s physical and mental well-being in relation to all areas of human sexuality and reproduction, for example, by combating sexual violence and genital mutilation? Does it, secondly, mean access to information about what has come to be called family planning? Or, thirdly, does it also include abortion? In the past, the Commission and the Council have made it clear in relation to questions from MEPs that this ‘sexual and reproductive health’ does not include abortion. That is exactly how I see it. I therefore think it important to establish that the term ‘the sexual and reproductive health of women’ is not in the context of abortion and I am therefore proposing a clarification to that effect in the text of the agreement. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what does freedom of religion actually mean? The answer is quite simple. It is the freedom to practise religion. Freedom of religion is not freedom from religion but the freedom to have religion. Freedom of religion does not create a religion-free society, but rather gives people the right to practice their religion openly within society. A crucifix in the classroom does not force anyone to believe, or not to believe. Therefore, it does not violate the freedom of religion. Nor have I ever heard of a right entitling someone not to be confronted with religious symbols. If this were the case, we would, in fact, immediately have to prohibit all crosses on gravestones and all church spires. The crucifix ruling of the European Court of Human Rights is therefore not only an attack on the principle of subsidiarity, but it also violates the right to religious freedom itself. We, the European Parliament, cannot and must not accept this ruling. The European Court of Human Rights should administer justice and not become a puppet for ideological and anti-Christian interests. Otherwise, we will have to seriously consider whether this Court actually still has a purpose at all. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have also voted no, because I am of the opinion that Turkey must first fulfil all the criteria, before we can make such a positive statement here. In particular, I would like to highlight the border dispute between Cyprus and Turkey, which has still not been settled this year, and the illegal occupation of Cyprus, which has not yet been brought to an end. However, I did not want to vote against the other accession candidates. I would particularly make an exception in the case of the Balkan States which I would like to welcome here in this House as soon as possible. Martin Kastler  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is often the case that good intentions cause problems. No one here would question the fact that non-smokers need comprehensive protection. However, the compromise motion for a resolution on smoke-free environments on which we will be voting on Thursday goes far beyond the protection of non-smokers. Even though the current draft explicitly supports the principle of subsidiarity, it also undermines it. The motion calls for strict and legally binding regulations at EU level. It abuses valid concern for health protection in an attempt to transfer invalid authority in the field of health policy and of work and social issues to a European level. We all want a Europe which is close to its people and the principle of subsidiarity is the key to this. The Member States or, in the case of Germany, the federal states, must have their own discussions on the protection of non-smokers. This is the only way to identify solutions which suit each country’s traditions and culture and are therefore close to its people. For these reasons, I would ask you to vote against the motion for a resolution in its current form on Thursday. Martin Kastler, 
 on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, on 2 October this year, the Iranian police stopped a man from boarding an aircraft at the last minute. The lawyer, Abdolfattah Soltani, was due to receive the International Human Rights Award for 2009 in my home town of Nuremburg for his courageous work on behalf of victims of political persecution. Despite having a valid passport, the Iranian powers refused to allow Mr Soltani to leave the country for no legal reason. His wife was allowed to leave. She rightly stated, and I quote: ‘It pains me that in a country that calls itself a theocracy, acts are committed that have nothing to do with God’. Iran is bound under international law by its ratification of the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which stipulates the human right that everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own. I find it scandalous that Iran is trampling this right underfoot. I am therefore lobbying for the Soltani case to be included in our joint resolution today, in our resolution on Iran, and I ask for your support. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

Mr President, first of all, I agree with fellow Members who have said that old accounts that are still unpaid must be settled. We should do so promptly in order to avoid additional interest which would make them even more expensive. It will not enhance our credibility with the public if we cannot disburse funds that they have applied for and have been granted and to which they are legally entitled.  That is why the amending budget must be formulated as a matter of urgency. The problem that we face for 2013, however, is that if the budget is too low, the amending budget will ultimately be even higher, for the previous year’s commitment appropriations will come back to haunt us, with all their financial implications. I have every understanding for the difficulties posed by crises, but if we genuinely want to make changes, we will have to talk about the commitment appropriations in connection with the multiannual financial framework, and that includes discussing how they should be dealt with. However, the past cannot be dealt with by questioning the law. I am most grateful to the Council and the Cyprus Presidency for engaging in such intensive negotiations. Monika Hohlmeier,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the PPE member responsible for Parliament’s budget, I also want to offer warm thanks to my colleague Derek Vaughan for the close and very fruitful cooperation we have had with all the other shadow rapporteurs. Although Croatia is now also a Member, which has imposed extra costs on the European Parliament, we have managed to stand by a 1.9 % rise, i.e. one that is actually below the normal rate of inflation. To that end, we have also made clear savings in a very wide variety of sectors, which means that we have managed to adopt a draft budget for the European Parliament that is also agreed with the Commission or in line with the Commission’s views. At the same time, however, I would ask those colleagues who may not mean any wrong but basically think we need more and more cuts to the European Parliament’s budget to remember that MEPs must be able to operate under proper working conditions and must also have the chance to review the documents presented by the Commission and proposals such as those put forward by the Member States at the European summit, and then in the end to be able to live with them. We need a competent Parliament, which is why we also need sensible, good and solid funding. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Schengen is one of the greatest achievements in the European Union, however I am also aware that our Member States are sensitive of their borders and are likely to remain so. I am aware that the problems that exist between the Member States in relation to Schengen cannot simply be ignored. These problems are many and varied. Ignoring these problems does not make them any better or easier to resolve. I live near the border with the Czech Republic and no one on our side would ever dream of simply closing the border again when problems are encountered. I would also call on the Commission to offer support in this area, rather than restrictions and rebukes. Dragnet controls were incorporated because we wish to ensure security while still allowing freedom to travel. If we are to be successful in implementing dragnet controls at locations that are frequent crossing points for drug dealers, such as the Czech border in particular, then I believe it is best for the German and Czech interior ministers to sit down together to find a joint solution to the problems that exist at the border. The Commission should not adopt a regulatory role here, but rather a positive supporting role. We wish to rein in the populists, but also to resolve the real problems in a concerted approach. That is why I am also calling on the Council to seek a solution together with Parliament, so that we can successfully conclude the Schengen dossier, upholding freedom to travel while also ensuring the security of our citizens.

 Madam President, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, today, I would like to focus, in particular, on the subject of the agencies. I have noticed that there is no specific focus on financing for the agencies in 2013 or in the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020. To give you a few examples, there are the new supervisory agencies: the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). If these agencies are to do justice to the job which we were discussing once again at the weekend, then they need to be equipped to do it properly, because otherwise, we will ultimately not be able to implement all the plans that we have put in place. Another example is Europol. Europol manages its budget very carefully. In 2011, it had particularly high levels of transfers because some programmes had begun later. The fact that Europol is now being punished with a 10% reduction and is supposed to establish a cybercrime centre with its current funding is simply impossible. We need to ensure that the agencies are properly financed and, at the same time, we need to monitor the management board structures, because I believe that the large number of members on the boards sometimes means that the agencies are managed less efficiently. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to discuss the subject of development aid. The question of budget aid has been a concern for us in the context of development aid for many years. I would like to express my thanks to the Court of Auditors for its numerous very sensible suggestions on this subject. I would also like to thank Commissioner Piebalgs for his increasing efforts to regulate budget aid in a sensible way. Budget aid is appropriate if there is a degree of certainty that the local administration is capable of using this budget aid to implement the projects undertaken in cooperation with the European Union. Secondly, we need to come up with a consistent concept in the area of development aid. I find myself repeating at every discharge hearing that all development aid spending needs to be introduced into the Commission budget at the same time and not just because we want to avoid exceeding the 1% limit. The money will certainly be spent. The question is simply whether it is spent in a coordinated, consistent and mutually agreed way and whether the European Parliament can play a role in spending decisions, rather than just monitoring spending. It is for this reason that I believe it is necessary to focus on the question of long-term and short-term measures in the context of development aid. We need long-term sustainable measures that will lead to improvements in the relevant countries as the years progress. Naturally, we also need short-term measures that can provide rapid relief in response to disasters, such as earthquakes, etc. However, when it comes to long-term projects, we cannot allow standards to be relaxed simply because the conditions in a particular country are not what they might be. Our projects need to make sense and have a purpose, otherwise we will find ourselves spending money for no good reason. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

Madam President, to begin with I would like to thank the European Asylum Support Office which has now started to take highly efficient measures, to give serious help to Greece and to play a very effective role, in particular with regard to what many Members have just called for, in other words, providing reasonable asylum accommodation. A few days ago the Greek Parliament decided that additional accommodation which meets European standards should be built. The European Union will or should give support for this, with the help of the European Asylum Support Office. I believe it is important that we in this Chamber do not constantly talk only about the dreadful things that have happened or the difficulties. Instead we should make it quite clear what we want to do and explain that we are not demanding that Greece comes up with a perfect solution overnight, given its disastrous internal situation. We will be applying realistic standards to the country and to what it is able to achieve. I also think it is sensible that many countries have stopped returning refugees and will continue to do so in future. Secondly, it seems to me to be important for us to extend our cooperation with Turkey. Ms Malmström has said that we are making an effort to do this. I think that amalgamating visa policy and return policy will cause significant problems. However, one possibility might be not to opt for the larger framework for visa policy, but instead to focus only on students and those in similar situations, including business people. This could be a solution for the countries which may currently still have difficulties in this area. Thirdly, we should agree on cooperation between police forces with regard to returning refugees, because this is about combating criminal people traffickers who are making money at the expense of poor refugees. It is not about disagreements with Turkey over questions of content. I hope and believe that Turkey is ready to start cooperating with our police forces on these issues.

Madam President, I believe that we must attempt, in collaboration with the European Asylum Support Office and the Greek authorities, to identify which of the people who have come to Greece could possibly be transferred to other countries within the European Union, firstly, because they can definitely never return to their home country and, secondly, because they may have potential and qualifications which are appropriate and useful. However, this is essentially also about helping the Greeks to register and identify these people more quickly, so that help can be provided sooner and so that those people who do not have qualifications or the entitlement to live in Greece or the European Union can be returned to their home countries, because they do have the opportunity of remaining there.

Mr President, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, ITER is a long-term research project. This means that we cannot simply shelve the treaties that we have entered into and the future plans that we have made in the important area of energy research every time we encounter a crisis or financial difficulties. We cannot decide not to comply with these treaties any longer and to turn a technology of the future into a technology of the past. I was somewhat suspicious about the claim that this technology should be a thing of the past. I was suspicious because we did not make smooth progress during the 30 years of research simply as a result of the fact that 30 years ago we did not have the computer capacity that we have today, which we needed both for materials research and for managing the high temperatures. This is why we have only been able to forge ahead rapidly with the ITER research in recent years. When we launch large projects, we must ensure that they are on a sound financial footing right from the start. This is a lesson which we need to learn within the European Union with regard to a variety of projects. When we start projects, they must have a professional project management team from the very beginning, an accurate and realistic estimate of costs, not simply one which sounds good in political terms, detailed financial controlling, a professional tendering process and a project support and monitoring function which can guarantee us an overview of the actual costs in the short and medium term. This is a long-term research project. It will not be completed in a short period and this is why I believe it is necessary for us not only to continue with this project, but also to acknowledge its future prospects. I have been to Cadarache myself and I have a different impression from yours, Ms Durant. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to give my sincere thanks to Mr Vaughan, the main rapporteur, and also to my fellow rapporteurs. We have worked very closely together and shared detailed information in the attempt to identify sensible solutions which would allow us to take the first step towards producing estimates of revenue and expenditure. I believe that it is very much worth mentioning that the increase in funding for the European Parliament is below the rate of inflation and that we will be carrying out an intensive and systematic evaluation of Parliament’s spending between now and the autumn, in order to identify further potential for cutting costs. In this context, we want to make it very clear to the public that while we are aware that the European Parliament needs a sensible level of resources to be able to work effectively, we also want to exploit every opportunity to introduce savings. From my perspective, this also involves making careful use of money where we take measures relating to the building. In this respect, it is also important to mention that we have already made some initial savings and that we have been able to bring about a significant reduction in some excessive rents. As far as bringing everything together on one site is concerned, I would like to suggest that we calculate the costs and the consequences of moving to one site, rather than just quoting the fictitious costs resulting from the journeys caused by being based at different sites. This will be necessary in order to carry out a useful analysis, since there are officials who do not have to travel at all, because they have no direct connection with Parliament and its work. Under these circumstances, moving to one site would not bring any benefits. We simply need to analyse the situation carefully and impartially. I would like to thank my fellow Members once again, because I believe that we are submitting good estimates. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the nature of the debate in this House shows that we represent the entire spectrum of opinion: on the one side, we have those who do not want restrictions of any kind, while on the other are those who associate any form of immigration with the risk of a massive influx of people. These are the two extremes to be found within the House. Family reunification must be viewed with a great deal of common sense and rationalism. On the one hand, problems genuinely exist in Member States with excessively restrictive policies. After all, we cannot put so many obstacles in the way of reuniting families that, in the end, reunification becomes an impossibility. On the other hand, Member States are fully justified in demanding language skills and integration, for example, or at least a willingness to integrate within a state. Secondly, the Member States naturally have the right to point out the problems that arise with family reunification, problems that should not be swept under the carpet. If countries like Greece, Malta, Romania or Italy are no longer permitted to indicate the problems they experience in this context, then I am not certain that we are taking a democratic approach by simply ignoring problems. We do not need another new directive. We should debate the problems carefully and then consider how we can remedy them. The continuous production of new directives will not lead to an improvement in the directives or their implementation. We are currently experiencing implementation problems in some areas. I completely understand that we need to engage in debate first, rather than drawing up yet another new directive and adding something to it before we have thoroughly discussed the old directive and the associated problems. I am in favour of listening to the Member States and of respecting the basic right of family reunification. If this is done in a reasoned and understanding way, then we will also achieve some progress. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by sincerely thanking my colleague, the rapporteur Mr Vaughan, for his excellent cooperation and his readiness to discuss the various problems in depth and to find a solution. We already presented an austerity budget last year, in which the actual original budget only rose by 0.8% and, in view of the additional costs incurred through the accession of Croatia and the Treaty of Lisbon, we still remained below the inflation rate of 1%, achieving 1.9%. This year, we are again publishing guidelines for an austerity budget, seeking to show that we are aware that we are in an environment in which it is not possible to make enormous financial leaps forward, but rather that consolidation is the order of the day, so that the budget will need to be examined in terms of efficiency and the potential for cutting costs. I also welcome the convening of a working group that is to bring in external experts as deemed necessary and useful, to work in this direction with the Bureau, the Secretariat and Parliament’s administration. I also believe it is right for us to further strengthen interinstitutional cooperation and that we should further optimise the way in which Parliament works in terms of organisation, efficiency, the use of financial resources and personnel. This has enabled us to save EUR 21 million in the area of translation and interpreting alone in a single year and we want to continue in this vein this year. As Mr Vaughan has said, we are freezing travel costs and day-to-day expenses and, with regard to buildings policy – after all I am the rapporteur on buildings – I believe it necessary for us to examine closely what we have agreed to see whether buildings policy and construction projects are being managed in a professional, cost-efficient manner. The particular aim will be to save costs in the medium term, in particular annually recurring costs, and to exploit the relevant synergies. We also expect the other institutions to join us in our efforts and to offer their support. I believe it is necessary for us to navigate a course in which the precise work of Parliament is linked with efficiency and good organisation. I would like to thank the Parliament administration, the Secretariat and the Bureau for their excellent cooperation and hope that we succeed in presenting a reasonable, solid and well-considered budget.

We voted against the report on the recasting of the regulation on public access to documents. The report goes far beyond the objective of achieving greater transparency by improving public access to documents. Existing legislation and interinstitutional agreements are ignored and the protection of intellectual property, sensitive and personal data is treated with contempt. Administrative processes and decisions, including those relating to personnel issues, should be published. The same applies to the protection of trade secrets and sensitive information within the framework of approval procedures, court proceedings and competition procedures. The report contains definitions that are vague, lack clarity and cast their net too widely. Any data or content connected in any way with the policies, measures and decisions of all bodies and institutions of the EU is defined as a document. This largely also includes preparatory, confidential and secret documents, as well as all associated information. Thus, the definition covers not only documents, but also information. The publication of information from ongoing interinstitutional processes, such as informal trialogue negotiations, enables public access to the procedure. This would open up the possibility of external influence. Lobbyists would have direct access to the legislative process. This report does not benefit our citizens. It would lead to a deluge of useless information, leading to a greater lack of transparency and rendering our work impossible. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, Ms Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control have both paid great attention to ensuring that in future the ITER project will be well managed, its finances will be monitored, its funding will be properly evaluated and the financial increases will be kept within reasonable bounds. However, I believe it is a major problem, in the case of a project established jointly by the Member States, which the Member States have decided on in the Council, when the Council opts in the same breath to increase research funding and extend the financing available for research and this results in cuts in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, in order to make more money available for ITER. This was not what was originally decided on by the Member States. Agreement was reached in the trialogue and my admiration goes to the rapporteur who showed the patience of a saint in attempting to ensure that progress was made in the negotiations. I would like to know how we in Europe are supposed to improve our global reputation when we demonstrate that we are lacking in unity and unable to agree in the context of a large international project. Making a note of this kind in the minutes about an amount of EUR 360 million, which retrospectively calls into question a joint compromise reached in the trialogue, is a simply disgraceful way of presenting ourselves to the rest of the world. We should see ITER as a really important project and Parliament is prepared to do this. However, in this case the Member States need to make some sensible proposals on financing the decision that they have reached, without once again interfering with the field of research.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am rather bewildered to hear some fellow Members saying that this directive would allegedly encourage unchecked mass immigration. The reality is the exact opposite. We are talking here about those with a proper work and residence permit, and if they are doing the same work as an EU citizen, then such people should also receive the same usual types of social benefits within the European Union as any other person would get. This safeguards those who work properly and with the right papers; it is not opening any floodgates. I also find it most amusing that some Members are complaining that too many groups are excluded, while others are complaining that mass immigration will take place. I congratulate the rapporteur. She seems to have found the golden middle way between giving the Member States the necessary individual powers of differentiation in certain decision areas and, on the other hand, providing a certain guarantee of social security for those working according to the rules. It should be a matter of course that family benefits depend on length of stay, but that someone who has earned a pension is able to take it with them if they have worked according to the rules. I therefore find it rather strange that people’s concerns that many workers will be crowded out of the labour market are being fuelled here. This directive has nothing to do with that.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in contrast to the previous speaker, I would like to begin by observing that, in my view, the European Parliament does not wish to express a resolution of no confidence in the Council. In other words, the motion that we are tabling does not mean that we have a lack of confidence in the Council or assume that funds are misspent. I do have a concern that the Council should give much more consideration to stronger cooperation with Parliament and collaboration between the three institutions. I will illustrate with an example. I am the rapporteur for real estate. It would be highly beneficial if the three institutions would coordinate with each other much better when it comes to buildings. The taxpayers would also be grateful, as perhaps then we could act more effectively and more in concert instead of as three institutions doing everything separately. The same applies, as I see it, to interpreters and other areas. We should work together. The general population can no longer be expected to understand how we do not even answer each other’s questions. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to thank Bulgaria and Romania for the impressive efforts that they have made. They have not only fulfilled the technical details of the Schengen Agreement, but have also taken very specific measures at their borders in order to safeguard the external borders of the European Union. The claim that they have only met the small-scale technical requirements is simply wrong. Everyone can go to these borders and see what Bulgaria and Romania have done to bring about a massive improvement in standards and in education and training and to see the measures that have been taken to secure the external borders. In my opinion, their efforts have been significantly underestimated. Secondly, the subject of corruption has repeatedly been mentioned, together with organised crime. I think it is right for us to discuss these matters and I also think it is right for us to take serious measures to combat corruption and organised crime within the context of the Schengen Agreement. However, laying the responsibility solely at the door of Bulgaria and Romania is wrong. There are also significant problems relating to corruption and organised crime within the Schengen countries. Therefore, against this background, and with regard to securing the external borders, I am calling specifically for the fulfilment of the Schengen Agreement in all the Member States to be evaluated, because it is necessary to ensure that all the Schengen countries meet the requirements, not only those which want to join. We need long-term safeguards and not simply short-term demands on two Member States. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur and Mr Klinz and, in particular, our coordinator Mr Karas, who has ensured that this is not only a balanced report, but also contains many passages that make worthwhile reading and that are essential for the future of the European Union and its 27 Member States. In today’s climate of global competition, it is no longer possible for every Member State to go it alone. I believe that competition is an important and necessary instrument. However, I also believe it is important for our 27 Member States to have joint strategies for the globalised financial markets and in relation to our major competitors on the other continents. I am not in favour of more Europe across the board, but I do advocate more Europe in areas where the 27 can only succeed by pooling their efforts. In this context, we have discussed key points in relation to the financial markets, pointing out, in particular, that we cannot achieve greater economic growth simply through financial trading, but rather that the answer lies in coordinated and sustainable economic activity. For this reason, I find this to be a very good report. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Mr President, I would like to raise two points in relation to cohesion policy and regional policy. The first is the dispute regarding the so-called intermediate category, which runs very much along national lines. I believe it is essential for us to consider the following points in relation to this discussion: regional policy and economic development policy must offer an incentive system so that the relevant regions can develop. If the system is set up in such a way that a dependency on continuous subsidy develops without requiring effort among the regions to obtain the relevant resources, then I believe that such an intermediate category would be an unmitigated disaster because it will always be a bone of contention and offers no rationale. However, I do believe that it makes sense for Objective 1 regions that lose their Objective 1 status to continue to receive special support. I also believe it makes sense that a region that is experiencing financial and economic difficulties for specific reasons should also receive support. What we do not want is a continuous subsidy mentality; instead we should offer help and support to the regions that need it. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by saying something about the comments on the House of European History. As rapporteur for buildings I would firstly like to say that the figure of EUR 136 million is definitely incorrect. Secondly, we are not talking about a prestige project here; after all, we are constantly complaining that people know nothing of European development since the Second World War, and we now want to make sure that two to three million people a year get to know these developments and find out more about them – so that perhaps they will be less Eurosceptic. We should debate together the level of the operating costs and the synergies that may be able to be realised with the information centre. A great many Members have taken part in the debate. However, the debate has only just become public, with the result that some Members do not yet feel they have been adequately informed. I will be happy to provide assistance with such discussions or requests for information. I consider the project to be necessary and useful, because people need to find out more about European development – otherwise there will be more and more Eurosceptics. Secondly, on the subject of development aid. I would first like to thank Mr Staes warmly for the fact that we have genuinely achieved a joint report in many, many respects that I can categorically support. I consider it essential that we set development aid priorities in the areas of infrastructure, health, education and particularly agriculture, and in particular I think that perhaps we should consider introducing an evaluation of projects after 10 years. It is not our aim to start only short-term projects that in the final event have no lasting effect. Moreover, we should make sure that we achieve better coordination of development aid with the Member States and also are able to implement once and for all the integration of the entire development aid budget into the EU budget, because it is incomprehensible why only part of our development aid is included in the EU budget.

 Madam President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, the House’s budget for 2012 is set against the background of a difficult economic and financial situation. That is why I see it as a positive development that we have agreed in the basic guidelines that Parliament’s budget is to be drawn up carefully within the framework of only modest increases and that adjustments should not exceed the inflation rate. I believe the target mentioned by Mr Fernandes, in relation to youth employment is very important because in our last budget we were very concerned that more money should be provided for youth than was previously the case because it is young people in particular who are affected by unemployment or who need special support, including from Europe. That is why I believe the additional EUR 100 million is a very positive approach. As the rapporteur on buildings, I would particularly like to point out that I believe it is extremely important for us to maintain a high level of efficiency in relation to the financing of our buildings and to monitor the financial situation with care. In this context I believe it is right that financial resources that cannot be spent on Parliament’s budget over the course of the year should be used as prudently as possible to avoid interest payments. In this regard it is also necessary to ensure that the monies are not spent in a mad rush at the end of the year, but rather that they are used to pay off buildings more quickly and more economically. In relation to the House of European History, we shall ensure that the operating plan is carefully examined once again and that the construction costs are closely monitored so that, crucially, an orderly budget can also be presented after the building is complete following notification in accordance with Article 179(3).

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks for the many talks we were able to have with the rapporteur and also with the Commissioner and shadow rapporteurs. This enabled good compromises to be reached in some areas. As Mrs Malmström just mentioned, this includes the compromise on free legal assistance, in particular, for the special protection of minors. Other achievements include the fact that we were able to agree on which applicants were particularly worthy of protection and, in our talks with one another, we were able to find a sensible compromise. Over and above that, we also found a compromise with regard to the subject of safe third countries. The aim is to fundamentally improve the quality of the administrative procedures so that there are fewer hearings in court in the second and third instance, in order to provide asylum seekers who are genuinely facing persecution with as rapid and as consistently effective assistance and protection as possible. I am strongly in favour of there being appropriate minimum standards in all Member States. Unfortunately, however, both the Commission’s text and some of the individual amendments intended to amend the Commission’s text to a certain extent do the opposite of what this good intention is striving to achieve. Many opportunities have been created to delay procedures or even to massively abuse asylum law. I will give you a few examples of this. For example, an applicant can make three inadmissible applications and has the right to go through the full procedure three times. Only then can an accelerated procedure be carried out. A procedure cannot be accelerated if someone is clearly not recognised as a refugee under the Geneva Convention. In this regard, I would simply mention the subject of Tunisia and also that of economic migrants. Another example is the fact that an accelerated procedure will also not be possible if subsequent applications are made without any relevant new content. What I consider to be even more serious, however, is the subject of disappearing. If someone illegally disappears, his application can no longer be closed with a negative decision. He has to countersign the letter. Therefore, if an asylum seeker were expecting news of a negative decision, all he would need to do – if we were to adopt the motion put forward by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – would be to refuse to accept the letter or not be there to receive it. The consequence of that would be that he could prolong the procedure indefinitely. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the 2012 budget is set against the background of a difficult economic and financial situation in the 27 Member States. For this reason, we will certainly not be able to afford to do everything that we would like to do. I believe that the report tabled by Mrs Balzani is a workable compromise. However, I also have a few critical remarks to make. In my opinion, more money does not necessarily mean more solidarity and more Europe. What is important is to improve the quality of what we get in return for the money spent and above all to ensure that the objectives we set ourselves are actually achieved rather than the money merely being paid out regardless. We must always examine the question of our potential new own resources with a critical eye, too. These own resources must not lead to the additional burdening of citizens or of businesses that need to be, and should be, able to compete with the rest of the world. I also think it is important for us not always to emphasise the fact that the EU budget amounts to only 2% because, at the end of the day, many States cofinance the corresponding European funds, thus, of course, making a considerably larger volume of funds available on the basis of EU programmes. I think it is particularly important for us to make progress in terms of research, education, sustainability and strengthening economic growth. In light of this, I think it is also important for large-scale projects such as ITER – and in this regard I would like to thank Mrs Jensen for her comment – to be fully and clearly financed and clearly managed, because otherwise the Americans, who are currently implementing the same project, will be appreciably ahead of us, and we Europeans should not always take second place.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to express my regret and dismay that neither the Secretary-General nor the two vice-presidents with responsibility for the European Parliament are present. We normally expect from the Commission that its responsible members should be present; we should also expect the same from our most senior representative. Secondly, I would like to address the subject of the management of the House’s buildings. I welcome the fact that the KAD project in Luxembourg is making progress, that it would seem that the costs are under control, and that things are going according to plan. When the KAD extension project is complete, bringing staff together under one roof should lead to greater efficiency and synergy, as well as reducing annual costs, because eight offices will be closed. It is essential that this target should be met as we need some of these funds for other purposes, as Mr Fernandes has pointed out. I believe that the House of European History is an important project because it will attract many visitors, who will be offered an insight into the significance, aims and purpose of the European Union in the context of European history in a very effective way. Thirdly, I would ask that the staff appointed in Luxembourg should be relocated to Brussels. Because they frequently need to work in Brussels, they are constantly travelling back and forth, also causing problems for the Members. This only applies to a small number of sub-areas and relocation really should be considered on efficiency grounds. Fourthly, I think it a very good thing that the European Parliament is only making provision for moderate expansion. The fact that other areas are only expanding on a modest scale should not be taken by the EEAS as a reason for massive expansion. I would call on all institutions to cut their cloth to their measure in these times of economic and financial difficulty. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, it is important that the EU comes to grips with the problems of migration and the right of asylum. The Commission has submitted proposals in this area. However, there is currently no accurate analysis of the implementation of existing legal provisions. There are also hardly any detailed calculations and analyses concerning the new proposals. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wholeheartedly supports the right of asylum and the right to protection for people who need it. However, when we look at the actual situation, it is unfortunately clear that people are applying for asylum for very different reasons or even systematically abusing the system. The right of asylum and subsidiary protection is not a tool for general migration into the 27 Member States. We must ensure that the organised people traffickers do not have the opportunity to make billions of euro in profit out of people’s fates as a result of our right of asylum. Asylum procedures must be fit for purpose and they must be implemented with great care. Victims of persecution must be guaranteed a refuge in the EU. This is why the Commission’s obligations in this respect are laid down in the new drafts. I think many of them are appropriate, including interpreters, proper healthcare and taking into consideration special protection needs. However, I would also like to mention the points which I believe are problematic. The authorities in the Member States are being given far too few opportunities to prevent abuse. The option of the accelerated procedure and the border procedure should be restricted by applying charges. If an applicant commits a serious breach of his duty of cooperation, there are very few possibilities of imposing sanctions. On the contrary, if an asylum seeker disappears, the Member State cannot bring the procedure to a negative conclusion. If he reappears, he is offered an extended range of procedural options. Even if an application is obviously without any foundation, the use of the accelerated procedure will only be possible after the second subsequent application. This will lead to significant cost increases. The current Commission draft states that free legal advice will be available from a lawyer, which will also result in the Member States’ costs rising considerably. I would simply like the Commission to reconsider the practical consequences of its proposals, the financial impact and the problems for the authorities in the Member States. We want to see a system with high standards, but it must be workable and should not present already overburdened Member States with completely impossible tasks. Monika Hohlmeier,

 Mr President, thank you very much for allowing me to speak again briefly. I have a request for you, Mr Füle. I would like to start by saying that incorrect assumptions lead to incorrect cost estimates. At the moment, the number of asylum seekers is not falling, but rising significantly. This is a result of visa facilitation, for example, for Serbia and Macedonia. We are currently also seeing a massive increase in abuses of the asylum system as part of attempts to enter countries in the European Union. If you start with incorrect assumptions, in other words, that disputing the first instance in detail will save costs in subsequent instances, it will automatically seem as if all Member States have poor first-instance procedures. However, that is not the case. If overall standards are raised, the consequence will be cost increases. Improving the standard of quality for everyone and making the procedures more complex will, in reality, result in increased costs. I am more than happy to discuss this point. Therefore, I would like to ask you specifically to take the concerns of the countries seriously, because some of the practical reports from the countries have already been completed and will be distributed.

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to make it clear, following repeated claims in this House, that during the budget negotiations, we have not requested a single cent more than the Council had offered us. This means that we were completely in line with the Council’s wishes. On the subject of the flexibility instrument, we need it because the Council regularly gets us into difficulties with its decisions on major projects for which it has not made provision for the funding. We then have to attempt, together with the Member States, to find a solution for these projects, in order to be able to support them financially and to make sensible plans. We have also not demanded more than what is laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. Instead, we are calling for compliance with the treaty. Nothing else, nothing more and nothing less. On the subject of own resources, it is surely not asking too much for Parliament to say that it would at least like to discuss the issue, what form it could take and whether own resources are in place. They cannot simply refuse to talk about this and then put the blame on Parliament. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, later on, we will be attending the reception for the deepening of relations between the European Union and the United States. The fact that this is happening today of all days is particularly significant. All of us will then have the opportunity to tell the ambassador what we have just underlined here in plenary. We ought to take the opportunity to do this in person. The United States of America is not making our work particularly easy at the moment, and it is not making our friendship very easy, either. On many issues, I have the impression that what we are seeing is more like a bull in a china shop than a performance on the elegant political stage. The EUR 14 alone is certainly not a decisive factor. However, if a family with three children wants to visit the United States of America, it then becomes a considerable amount and may ultimately prevent them from travelling there. On top of that, if you have to give extensive details on the Internet about which airline you are travelling with, where you are travelling to, which hotel you are staying in and, in addition, you have to give your credit card number, it raises a number of questions as to why all of this is necessary. If, in addition, you then hear the accounts of some good acquaintances who have had to wait for hours at American airports and experience the discourteous security control, then you sometimes ask yourself whether the United States of America is actually aware that in many areas, it is currently treating its own friends rather discourteously and perhaps, in certain respects in relation to what people actually need and have to do, it is way off the mark. Furthermore, with regard to our close transatlantic relations, I have to say that we do have a close relationship with the United States. However, this should also mean that we are treated accordingly. I call on the Commission and on you, Mr Šefčovič, to make a clear demand for visa-free travel to be ensured for those Member States that do not currently enjoy this facility, and if this is not followed by an appropriate reaction, then please also demand that reciprocity be introduced. It is not a question of ‘an eye for an eye’, but we must negotiate on equal terms and we must not allow ourselves to be treated in the same way that a feudal lord would treat his serfs. We are not serfs; we are of equal stature. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I note that the Council does not wish to debate the multiannual financial framework. May I tell the Council that the European Parliament would very much like to debate it, and that the Council cannot act as if it is in a kindergarten by telling us that it will not answer our questions or comment on our proposals. Secondly, in this connection, I must ask the Council whether it wants to have Lisbon or not. Lisbon is not a mere technical adjustment; it imposes more competences and means there are more responsibilities to discharge – and that includes answering related financial questions. Moreover, the Council has taken decisions that result in new financial expenditure. That has been mentioned by many of my fellow Members. If the Council wishes to do this, and if it does not want more money to be spent, then it must also state quite specifically where and how it wishes savings to be made, where exactly these funds are to be shifted from – and not simply propose general percentages to be redeployed while leaving Parliament and the Commission with the unpleasant task of deciding where the money is to be taken from, especially since our opportunities for redeployment and budgetary revision are extremely limited. The additional responsibilities that you have imposed on us are so challenging that they do not involve small incidental amounts – I will merely mention the area of the financial solidarity of our Member States and their corresponding financial difficulties. If the programme is to be implemented, then we are not taking about small sums that can be redeployed without further consideration. The same applies to ITER, the same applies to matters of internal security, the same applies to significant matters relating to research, the same also applies to questions concerning Parliament’s priority areas such as youth training and research. We have to deal not only with shortcomings in implementation, but also with a lack of transparency when it comes to the disbursement of funds. We need to debate and work through all these matters quite specifically; the Council cannot simply keep silent on them. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all of the Member States of the European Union are suffering under the burden of huge debts and from the effects of the financial and economic crisis. However, they are also suffering as a result of the fact that, for years, high budget deficits – some of which are excessive – have been accepted and tolerated in a large number of countries. When we start to tackle the new 2011 budget it is not enough merely to reduce the budgets of the Member States. We also need to undertake a thorough review of the expenditure from our budget and also carefully review new expenditure. I would mention the European External Action Service, the structure and also the financing of which is still extremely unclear. There is no transparent structure. I would also call for cost-efficiency by using the synergies with national external action services. There must be clear rules regarding responsibilities and a transparent rendering of accounts to the European Parliament, and attempts should not be made to void the European Parliament’s codecision and supervision roles in more and more decisions. The European Parliament is cooperative and will also be supportive in difficult situations. For this reason, we must also involve the European Parliament in these matters as co-decision-maker. Furthermore, I think it is necessary for us at last to make the reduction in bureaucracy a reality, for example in agriculture and also for small and medium-sized enterprises, which urgently need to grow and to implement and cope with innovations. If we want to reduce budgetary deficits, as well as taxes, and increase tax revenues, we need to reduce the burden of bureaucracy on small and medium-sized enterprises and enable innovation, and we must finally reduce the merciless competition exerted by large-scale industry on unpopular small and medium-sized enterprises, and not encourage it. I also share the view of the Chair of our Committee on Budgets that we first need precise data regarding this budget before we can finally adopt it. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE
).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to discuss the problems with development aid that are nearly always emphasised by the Court of Auditors and to thank Mrs Ayala Sender for her good cooperation that was remarkably pleasant. Firstly, there is often the problem of budget support. That means that there is even suspicion that in countries where we are trying to help the population a little, budget support is partly being used by corrupt and totalitarian regimes to suppress undesirable population groups or even critics. I am extremely critical of this budget support. It should be reduced or stopped for countries in which we clearly have problems with the use of budget support. Secondly, now as before, we have the problem that the payments often contain errors, that there is a lack of coordination and targeting of development aid projects between the different institutions and levels in one country and there is no recognisable setting of priorities. It is essential that this is made a matter of priority, so that we can improve the sustainability and effectiveness of projects in those countries where people really are in dire need. Furthermore, now as before, I consider it essential that development aid and the European Development Fund in general are integrated into the overall budget. On pre-accession aid for Turkey I would like to say that I was surprised that the completely normal criticism which, in other countries, would have long since led to the blocking and withholding of financing, has led so quickly to a hiccup in the cooperation between Turkey and the Commission. I consider it completely normal that we firstly lay down the strategy and the goals, then the timeframes, the project orientation, the yardsticks for measuring and then the method of performance monitoring. However, if all of this is lacking and projects are implemented that are then declared successful, I have a problem with the way the programme is implemented. For this reason, I personally consider it necessary that at least part of the funding is withheld until it we have suitable assurances that the funds will be properly spent. We have now reached a compromise, but I consider it necessary to monitor the problem, since other countries like Bulgaria, Romania or Greece will be affected. I think it is necessary that everyone be treated in the same way and not differently. Therefore, I ask that in the area of buildings policy, provision be made for a medium-term building strategy by means of clear construction and financial planning. Large projects should receive their own budget lines and a reporting system related to construction progress, and we should not pay any more costs for bridging lenders. As we are such large institutions, we need buildings and they must be planned carefully and transparently. My last point is that I believe it is necessary to simplify the programmes as a matter of urgency, since that is how problems in the respective countries arise, and this must not simply remain a rhetorical demand, but must finally be implemented. (Applause) Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unlike the previous speaker, I would expressly like to thank both Commissioner Malmström and Commissioner Reding for their intensive efforts to take up the issues that have been raised by Parliament, as well as the problems that we see and have seen in the area of data security and confidentiality, in order to negotiate with the United States. I am also grateful that key issues – as mentioned by my fellow Members – have already been analysed or considered in the mandate and that, in particular, this also includes issues in the area of inspection as well as the area of reciprocity. On the matter of the erasure of data, I also consider it very important to be able to renegotiate the five-year period, since it is really not acceptable to hold data for such a long time. I also feel it is important to ultimately discuss the matter of penalties in cases of deliberate extraction to the wrong ends in sensitive circumstances, since that prevents certain things being extracted that we do not want to see extracted. The focus should only be on terrorism. To me, what is also important is the idea that we have to tackle our own TFTP and that in the longer term, we cannot transfer bulk data, that is to say, large amounts of data to the United States. That has nothing to do with mistrust, but the fact that in the long term, we ultimately want to take our own responsibility within Europe on an equal footing, and then exchange specific extracted data for the sole purpose of combating terrorism and finally maintain real reciprocity. In this context, I would again like to ask the Commission to indicate how the topic of our own TFTP is viewed within the Commission and in the joint discussion with the Council. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE
).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am astonished by the discussion on the part of fellow Members who, on the one hand, speak of simplifications for small and medium-sized enterprises, but who, when it comes to taking the very first step for micro-entities – and that is all we are talking about today, not about any other scale – are already inclined to say no again. We cannot always demand something and then subsequently say no. I have spoken with many micro-entities. They are hoping and waiting for this regulation. I have spoken to regional banks, who stressed very clearly to me that it would not be a problem for them at all if financial reporting was changed; they use other data any way. Furthermore, there will be absolutely no change in terms of transparency, because – as the Commissioner has explained – provisions will remain in force so that transparency is also maintained. Trade will not be affected, because the micro-entities do not have an impact on the European market in the sense of trading throughout Europe. I call on fellow Members to take this step with us and thank Mr Lehne and the committee for their excellent work. Monika Hohlmeier  (PPE

 My decision to vote against the interim SWIFT agreement is not a decision against cooperation with the USA on combating terrorism. I emphatically advocated that a new, compatible agreement that would allow European and US security authorities to work closely together and enable them to detect money transfers with suspected links to terrorism should be created as swiftly as possible. However, there are major flaws in the interim agreement, including inadequate provisions as regards data deletion, rights of complaint and access to information and onward transmission to third parties. Moreover, what I expect from a genuine partnership between the European Union and the USA is one which does not merely leave the responsibility for ensuring security of citizens within the framework of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (TFTP) in US hands, but which also provides a clearly defined time-frame for the development of a European TFTP, in partnership with the USA, within the European Union, as well. For this reason, I hope that an agreement will be negotiated, in the nearest future, which still provides a long-term basis for jointly combating terrorism worldwide, in terms of detecting terrorist networks and their financial transactions, but which respects citizens’ data privacy, as well.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the focus until now has been on the cohesion fund and this is certainly justified because of the size of the budget. However, I would now like to draw attention to an area in which only EUR 2.7 billion was spent last year, but which causes significant problems. The European Court of Auditors, which I would like to thank warmly at this point, has produced a semi-masterpiece, as it has succeeded in bringing transparency to the fragmented administration in the area of development aid and in clearly identifying the problems which continue to occur. I would not like to go as far as saying that this area has no universal principle and no transparent structures, but it does have considerable problems. There have been improvements, for example, in the payments for projects, but nevertheless it is still the case that no audits can be carried out on some of the projects because the receipts are missing, not to mention the fact that some receipts are not even provided in the first place or that there are no opportunities for follow-up audits. The subject of budget aid once again involves particular problems because it is not possible to follow up or trace the money and what it is used for. In my opinion, we should carefully consider finally integrating the European Development Fund (EDF) into the general budget, for reasons of transparency, traceability and manageability. This would allow us to combine and coordinate the EDF with other fields, such as development aid, foreign policy, neighbourhood policy and other policies in the same area, so that we could obtain a complete and transparent overview. This is my proposal.
