 Mr President, I would like to start from a local perspective. Last Friday I visited Blantyre in my constituency to talk to an alliance of Credit Unions in that part of Scotland. As the Commissioner will know very well, Credit Unions in some parts of the Union provide cheap and affordable types of safe credit to consumers through voluntary organisations carrying out voluntary effort in a non-profit way. They were very concerned early on in the process that they may be caught in some of the technicality of this directive. I am extremely grateful to Mr Wuermeling for the way in which, in Amendments Nos 4 and 62, he has sought to create an exemption for that kind of activity. It is really very important and my constituents were very grateful to learn just how much had been done in that respect. While there may be still issues among us about the exact balance between the consumer and the lender contained in the Wuermeling report, we are all agreed that it is vitally important to make safe the internal market so that there can be much wider trade, but not at the cost of unfairness to consumers. I congratulate him genuinely on the work he has done. While we will be supporting some amendments against him tomorrow, it will not be at the cost of backing the general project. The same goes for Mrs Gebhardt's proposal. We are talking about consumer rights. No rights without remedies is a good old slogan and I think that the point of the new regulation of which the Commissioner and Mrs Gebhardt have spoken is very much to secure that there are adequate and forceful remedies for rights that we all support. Likewise, if I may say to Mrs Ghilardotti, the idea that we should begin to develop a jurist prudence of fair-trading in the European Union is a grand one. This will be done, of course, in a negative sense by generating a general duty not to trade unfairly. I congratulate Mrs Ghilardotti for all the work she has done. There may be one or two points of disagreement in the vote tomorrow, but the point is that we are all piloting the boat in the same direction.

 Mr President, on a technical matter, I want to add the words 'and to the Commission' to Article 4 of the Schulz immunity report. I would make the same request in relation to the Lehne report. To explain, as Members of the House will know, Article 9 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of Parliament confers an immunity on Members of Parliament for expressions of opinion and votes cast in the exercise of their office. We believe that part of the German MEPs' Statute is incompatible with that. We request, in paragraph 3, that the Commission should verify whether clause 5 of the second sentence of that Statute is compatible with Community law. However, in Article 4, we omitted to refer the matter to the Commission in the properly formal way. Members will also wish to know that this concerns a case in which two Members of this House have been subjected to an injunction at the instance of Bild-Zeitung
 to prevent them holding press conferences in this House criticising the conduct of Bild-Zeitung
 in relation to the Members' Statute. (Applause)

 Mr President, in supporting Mr Miller's general line about this report and in particular his points about water, I want to draw special attention to Amendment No 13. It would be a very illiberal doctrine to say that liberalisation should be pursued in an inflexible way, insensitive to local realities. We ought to look at, for example, the case of remoter parts of the European Union. We should therefore, for example, welcome the flexibility in relation to local transport services indicated by the recent Altmark judgment. Unfortunately, however, the Commission has said that this cannot possibly apply to ferries. Buses are not ferries – indeed they are not – but transport is transport, by sea and by land. Mr Miller mentioned the problem of Railtrack in the United Kingdom. Split the ownership of the rails from the ownership of the trains and you get a crazy situation. In Scotland it seems that we are about to split the ownership of the ships from the ownership of the companies that sail them. Railtrack by sea! This is liberalisation pursued in an extreme and inflexible way. Mr Bolkestein is a frequent and always welcome visitor to Scotland. I hope that on his next visit to the Hebrides he does not have to travel under an assumed name to hide his responsibility for the fiasco which is about to be wished upon us!
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mr Bolkestein offers to visit Skye. He is very wise! It is the only island of the Hebrides now joined to the mainland by a bridge and does not depend upon the services of ferries subject to public service obligations. (Laughter)

 Mr President, representing, as I do, a constituency which is associated with such products as Scotch whisky, Highland shortbread and Borders knitwear, I am fully aware of and sensitive to the points many have made about the evils of counterfeiting and piracy, which extend much more widely than just to products of the kind I have mentioned. I, therefore, strongly support the idea of introducing a directive of this kind. However, I do not agree entirely with Mr Byrne when he claims that a balance has been struck. That is not what we hear from the Generic Medicines Association, which is very fearful that extension of this set of remedies to patent law will damage its interests and thus the interests of the health services of Europe and beyond. A balance has not been struck. Patents must be excluded, and the point about the commercial scale must be extended to the whole of the directive, not just to some parts of it. Finally, I say with great personal sympathy for Mrs Fourtou that this case shows up a gap in our rules about declaration of interests. The issue of familial interests needs to be included. I say that without any personal discourtesy.

 Mr President, scarcely less important than passing wise laws is seeing that they are actually implemented and it is, therefore, encouraging to read the Commission's report, which my report addresses. However, as my report suggests, there is a real problem about the non-compliance with Community law among big states. The worst example – which is cited in the explanatory statement – concerns the treatment by the Italian State of a group of university lecturers, who, after 14 years, have still not had their rights enforced, despite two resolutions by this House. I have just received information that, despite the European Commission's decision to ask the European Court of Justice to impose fines of EUR 309 750 a day, the Italian Parliament has just passed legislation which enhances the illegal discrimination against these citizens. I find this outrageous. I hope the House will support my report. (Applause)
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 –
 Mr President, I wish to raise a point of order touched on in the debate this morning. It concerns declarations of interest in this House where an interest is a familial one rather than a direct personal one. This has been the subject of various newspaper articles, including a leader in the London Times
 – which at least used
 to be a serious newspaper. Mrs Fourtou has behaved with extreme honour and goodwill throughout, but has been put in the invidious position of bringing forward a report and then being accused of not having declared an interest. We must have clarity as to whether and when familial interests have to be declared. (Applause)

 I warmly thank Commissioner Fischler for that very direct answer. It is extremely important that this allegation of abuse of dominant position should be investigated. A particular concern is that the breeders of juvenile fish, or smolt, are mainly based in Scotland and Ireland and are dependent entirely on sales to the ongrowers who are in turn affected by the feed manufacturers. The feed manufacturers and the ongrowing concerns are heavily dominated by Norwegian interests and that is where the abuse of dominant position within the market arises. One particular risk that it gives rise to is that a particular asset currently in the hands of EU-owned salmon breeders is the genetic data and genotyped brood stock, which is of fundamental importance, as I am sure the Commissioner well realises. In conducting his further investigation, with which I will be very happy to cooperate as much as I can, will he take a particularly close and concerned look at that aspect of the situation?
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 – 
Commissioner, you will forgive me for finding the situation unsatisfactory, as I am sure you do too. We were assured, at the time the European arrest warrant was introduced, that effective common minimum standards would follow hot on its heels. We now discover that they are not going to. Those of us who suggested building a European habeas corpus 
into the arrest warrant find ourselves reinforced in our belief that this would have been wise. Can you concede, Commissioner, as one who has been a doughty fighter in this regard that, if the new Constitution were to come into force, the Member States would in future find themselves subject to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union when executing European arrest warrants, and that this would be binding law because in implementing European arrest warrants they would be implementing European law?

 Mr President, at Dundrennan, in my constituency in the south-west of Scotland, there is a firing range where depleted uranium shells are used for practice. I receive many letters of complaint and concern about this. One recently drew my attention to the fact that over the years nearly 29 tonnes of depleted uranium have been deposited in the waters off south-west Scotland, therefore also affecting the Irish Sea. I have been asked to draw this to the attention of Mrs Wallström and shall certainly be writing to her about it too. I am glad she is here today and that the Irish presidency is also present. It is a matter of serious concern that this dangerous substance is being fired in considerable quantities into waters which drain tidally into the Irish Sea, affecting at least two EU Member States, in probable violation of the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by the Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972, as extended by recent protocols.

 Madam President, I wish to thank Mr Dimitrakopoulos for his work on this report and for the scheme he has brought forward. However, my Group and I will be voting against the report if Amendments Nos 6 and 7 are not adopted. We think they are important. The quality of a democracy is measured by its respect for its minorities. It is very important to note that the d'Hondt proportionality, which governs the composition of our Bureau, does not, and cannot, guarantee that all political positions represented in Europe – far less represented in this House – will take part in the decision-making. This is all the more objectionable when the rule is that parties seeking funding need only be heard on some issues rather than on all issues that come before the Bureau. These are points I take very seriously. It is also important that in discussing the funding of political parties it is necessary that all voices should take part, even though we accept that the d'Hondt proportionality means that only some of the parties should be participants as voters on the Bureau. I hope these amendments will be accepted, because if they are not we will certainly vote against the report. As I have said, politics is also about the representation of minorities. I slightly disagreed with what Mr Dimitrakopoulos just said about political parties being institutions, which build in with parliaments and commissions, etc. Above all, in the political tradition to which I belong, political parties are voluntary associations of like-minded citizens. All the better that they should now become voluntary associations of like-minded citizens collaborating right across this great continent. However, voluntary associations are not the same as institutions, even though the maintenance of satisfactory democratic politics requires, in contemporary circumstances, that there be some public support for political parties. I speak in this House for the European Free Alliance, for the parties representing minority nations within Member States – regions, as they are sometimes called: not very accurately, in my judgment. The increase in size of the Union, with the welcome arrival of many small states, makes it ever harder for a party like the European Free Alliance, which has been in existence for many years, to satisfy threshold requirements of the kind that are now being set. Every time we come to this House it appears that the hurdles are set yet higher in favour of the large political groupings, while neglecting the fair and legitimate interests of minorities. Therefore I call upon the House to accept this report only if at least Amendments Nos 6 and 7 are adopted.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I am sure that Mr Corbett did not intend to misrepresent my position, but he accidentally did. I strongly agree that the Bureau should decide it; but when the Bureau sits to decide these matters, it should have among it representatives of other parties. That is what I said and I think that is correct.

 Mr President, it is a pleasure to address you tonight on this important theme. This afternoon I had the fortune to chair a meeting in which we were discussing the proposed directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights. In that discussion, what came out most clearly was that the biggest difference among the legal systems of the European Union is actually the difference concerning procedure, rather than the substance of law. Proposals for the approximation of procedural law are amongst the most difficult to achieve effectively. That is something that we need to bear in mind. As you well know, I represent an area of Scotland in this House. We, in Scotland, have the unique good fortune of having a legal system that is more or less half and half, i.e. an amalgam of the civilian systems of mainland Europe and the common law system of England, Ireland and Northern Ireland. Perhaps the Commissioner should devote her time to studying Scots procedural law as a potential bridge between the two great different systems of this continent. However that may be, in my Group we certainly support the idea of moving from conventions to regulation. Mr Medina Ortega is entirely right to say that the regulation is the right instrument to deal with these problems of harmonisation. Finally, in relation to small claims, all that is in the Gargani report is admirable. However, I should particularly like to underline, in regard to the service of documents, paragraph 6(i) that states: 'service should effected by specialised personnel with legal training capable of explaining every aspect of the procedure to the debtor'. Much of what we have done in the way of harmonisation is defeated at the moment by bad translation, lack of interpretation and lack of clarity. I beg to support that point.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, with great respect to Mr Alyssandrakis, I have to differ with him. In common with most other colleagues who have spoken in the debate, I think this directive is going in the right direction and that we should all be pushing it as well as we can towards a conclusion. There are points of difference between us and these are important points. The grand idea of simplification, of bringing 15 different sectoral directives together into one overall scheme, is really an extraordinarily important one, not just for the reasons which Mr Harbour and others have mentioned, because of the completion of the single market, but also because of our responsibility as a Union to supply our citizens with reasonably clear and intelligible laws. If we can bring together the whole body of law concerning recognition of professions into a single coherent package, that is in itself a good thing in terms of the quality of the laws that we produce in this Union. It is important not to lose the particular protections that apply to different professions. It would be a very bad thing if you over-simplified, as Mr Bowis pointed out, to the point that you get rid of essential protections. For example, in relation to the provision of services in the health professions by health professionals. All of us have to confess, taking the example that he gave, that we can have very good professional qualifications and professional disciplinary tribunals and still people such as Dr Shipman can get through the net. That just shows the point, and it is a point which Mr Zappalà was making, that the relationship of professionals to other members of the community is a curious one: someone who goes to a professional for advice gives herself or himself over to the power of that person because the professional necessarily knows more about the client or patient's problem than the client or patient does or can. You would not have professions otherwise. That power relationship between professionals and citizens is one which requires regulation of the kind we have been talking about. It requires proper structures  for example, the kind of structures that would emerge under some of the proposals from the committees and subcommittees that will deal with particular professions within the grander overall framework. Mr Alyssandrakis said that we are engaged in an effort of levelling down. I beg to differ. As a lifelong provider of a kind of professional training, as a professor of law, I would be the last to disparage the importance of on-the-job, in-practice training as well as the importance of the kind of work that I have spent a lot of my time doing  classroom teaching, tutorials and so on. What is important, and Mr Harbour mentioned this, is the maintenance of the five levels that we already have. There have been some proposals to refine these yet further. I would certainly deplore that. I think we have an 'understood' set of five levels and these should be retained. They should also be clarified. Having read Amendments Nos 192 to 196 in the name of Mrs Kauppi, Mr Harbour and others, I think that does a rather elegant job and, in any event, between now and the final vote, it is up to us to try and bring it together in such a way that we get a clear, intelligible and workable package at the end of the day. The engineering case has been mentioned. There is a point here which we all share. With great respect, it is too soon to go as far as Mr Zappalà is suggesting at this stage. It is important that we get the engineers to a better condition of mutual understanding in the different countries and that we achieve a better situation so that someone who is entitled to call themselves an engineer in Italy can feel that the same applies to a chartered engineer in the United Kingdom, and vice versa
. We need to develop a common platform. Across the House there have been indications of movement towards agreement, and very important that is. It has been said that it is important in the single market to have free movement of labour to provide services. I agree with that. Since the beginning of my time in this Parliament, I have been involved in the case of the foreign language lecturers at Italian universities who had four judgments in their favour over 14 years and who are still not guaranteed or granted adequate rights of access to employment on the same terms as Italian nationals. That is just one example of why the work we are doing is of such vital importance if we are to have equal access to work and equal opportunity to provide services, with adequate protection for citizens and consumers across the Union. I strongly support the direction in which we are going and hope we manage to get home to port at the next plenary.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, it is customary for a speaker in my role to assure rapporteurs that we are right behind them, but in this case that would not quite be appropriate. In this case, the cart is firmly behind the horse, and she is leading us – as well as all the Members of the Committee and Parliament – in the charge. We are very grateful to Mrs Echerer for having given us that lead. As was said in the debate, there is a kind of tripod involved in relation to copyright and related rights. One leg of the tripod is the copyright legislation that has already been adopted by Parliament. The second leg is the enforcement provisions that we are currently debating, and the third leg is the issue of collecting societies and the administration of copyright in the interests of rights holders. As Commissioner Bolkestein said, these are monopolies, but they are in principle benign monopolies because of the territoriality of copyright. It may be – and perhaps Mr Harbour and Mr Karas will explain this to me one day – that collecting societies can operate in competition with each other within a given domain or within a given country, but I find it difficult to see how that would work. If I am right, the point made by the Commissioner earlier assumes tremendous importance, namely that we need to look closely and critically at the governance of these societies, which are in a position to 'rip people off' by charging unduly high fees for providing services to artists, authors and others. I am delighted to hear that the Commission is to follow up the Committee's initiative by bringing forward a proposal for a legislative instrument concerning the good governance of collecting societies. It is a proposal I await eagerly. I would like to make a point in response to what Mr Harbour said that also provides me with an opportunity to declare a minor interest. I am an academic author and a very modest part of my annual income, as anybody who reads the Declaration of Members' Interests will know, comes from rights management on behalf of myself as an academic author. Looking at it from the point of view of an author of that kind, the notion of the reader as customer is not as significant as Mr Harbour said. The critical notion – and this also applies to the arts – is surely the reader or consumer as audience. One is concerned about getting ideas across to people and getting them engaged in debate about ideas. From that point of view, it is a matter of total indifference to an author what or how much they get paid. Quite the reverse. I and authors like myself have no chance of getting ideas to a wide public unless there are effective publishing systems – that is to say publishers who get paid for their activities. In that sense, this whole business of collective rights is for us more a means to an end than an end in itself. We should not think of it simply in terms of customers, but as an essential feature of the single market. We are delighted with the Commission's proposal and, like everybody else, I am so pleased to have worked with Mrs Echerer on this.

 I wanted to suggest to Mr Roche – and it is a great pleasure to see him here after many exchanges at the Convention – that the issue Mr Ortuondo Larrea raised, and with which we are dealing here, is a profound one. It is about the role and place of countries within Member States. The Irish presidency, not least because of its interest in the problems of Northern Ireland, but for other reasons as well, ought to give its mind and invite its colleagues to give their minds to the issue of the adequate and improved representation of countries of that kind.

 Mr President, it is a particular pleasure to be called to speak immediately following Mr Rothley, who has done so very much during the whole of this Parliament to bring the matter to the conclusion that we seem now to be at the point of reaching. He has paid compliments to other colleagues, so let me pay a very warm compliment to him. It has been a great pleasure to work with him on this matter. It is something to be welcomed by us all that, provided the Council keeps its eye on the ball, we shall have a proper Members' Statute before the next elections. It is absolutely critical to these elections. I shall not be a candidate myself, so I speak without a personal interest in the matter. Indeed, I will be 63 when I retire, but not on this pension scheme. (Laughter)
 It is essential to have a proper expenses regime and to have a common salary. I have been rapporteur several times on privileges and immunities under the existing protocol. It must be said that it is an extremely labyrinthine and arcane system and not a satisfactory basis for the privileges and immunities of a House of this kind. Therefore, although this matter is not going to be brought home at this stage, I would echo the proposition that we must work hard in the near future to get the whole issue of privileges and immunities put on a proper footing as well. (Applause)
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 –
 Mr President, my Group asked me to give an explanation on its behalf. Simply and briefly it is a point which concerns paragraph 2(b). As I said in the debate in the morning, we are very strongly in favour of reform of the Protocol concerning Privileges and Immunities. The existing rules relating to privileges and immunities are unsatisfactory. However, as we said in the debate leading up to the decision on 3 and 4 June, the text that was approved then is unduly extensive in the privileges and immunities it prescribes. So we voted against paragraph 2(b), not because we oppose reform but because it is too generous a model for reform.

 Mr President, on the last occasion we met I raised a question about the Scotch whisky industry which was of considerable public concern. You very kindly, on behalf of the House, took it up with Commissioner Byrne, who is fortuitously here present. I am glad to report that the Scotch Whisky Association has reached a consensual settlement of that difficult question for the time being. I hope that it will be possible for the whole matter to be resolved through satisfactory industry standards. The attention that this House and other public bodies paid to this matter was instrumental in reaching a solution, so I thank you and encourage you all to celebrate the New Year of 2004 with an appropriate beverage! (Laughter and applause)

 Mr President, you will no doubt recall as vividly as I do the late nights in Luxembourg in June 2001 when we last went through this exercise, followed by the heated third-reading debate in this House shortly thereafter, which was lost by a tie. It is worth reminding ourselves that although technically we are now at first reading, this is in fact a fourth reading, even just for those of us who have participated in the present Parliament. We have been through this a long way and I myself am one of those who think that if we can bring it to a successful conclusion this time, then we should do so. I take the point made by Mr Huhne and Mr Bolkestein that there are further problems we did not have before. It is perhaps a little like the story of the Sybilline Books. The first time they were offered as a set of 12 and Tarquin refused them. Three of them were then burned and they were offered as a set of nine at a higher price: each time the price goes up and the quality goes down. Maybe that is so, or maybe not, but we are now in a position where we have to make up our minds. My Group is firmly of the conviction that we must take full and proper account of employees' rights in this context. Employees are not just pawns on the chess board. Employees are the people who make companies work and make them function effectively. Their interests have to be taken fairly and fully into account. Their right to consultation and information has to be taken seriously. On that account, my Group will certainly vote for the sets of amendments agreed between us, the GUE/NGL Group and the PSE Group when the vote is held tomorrow. Thereafter we are of two minds: some of us are firmly of the view that we should adhere to this to the last, and that if they are not carried then we will vote against the directive in its present form. If that means the compromise collapses then it will simply have to go to second reading, and so on. Others - and I am one of those others - think that the time has come to reach a conclusion. I shall vote for these amendments, but at the end of the day I shall try to get this through at this reading.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I agree with what my friend and colleague, Mr Miller, was just saying. At the moment it is a pious platitude to say that the polluter pays - polluters on the whole do not pay or pay only a small part of what they should pay. It would be a great thing to move forward to a situation where it becomes a principle of law and not a pious platitude that polluters have to pay. I was grateful for Commissioner Bolkestein's remarks about Amendments Nos 48 and 61. It is important to take account of permits and state-of-the-art. However, as the common position indicates, there are permits and permits. The degree of detail and specificity of what is permitted varies from situation to situation. In these circumstances, to have an all-or-nothing principle - either something is covered by a permit and, therefore, exempt from any liability, or it is not covered and fully liable - seems like a mistake. It seems right to adopt a principle of mitigation so that there is a sliding scale taking account of the variability of permits and circumstances. The Commissioner also talked about nuclear liability. I happen to be the rapporteur for the still stalled report on the reform of the Paris Convention. I take his point that this will expand the range and level of liability of nuclear operators, but it remains the case, unhappily, that nuclear power still travels in a boat of its own, subject to a rather special exception to the 'polluter-pays' principle - the polluter pays quite a lot, but not necessarily everything in that case. My Group resents the special treatment of the nuclear industry. We said that during the Euratom debate and there will, no doubt, be other occasions to say it. We are also concerned about going too easy on the GMO cases. That is another example where deliberate economic activity aimed quite laudably at profit and gain can cause exponentially spreading damage of a most alarming kind, and not to bring that within the scale of this directive would be to create an unjustifiable exemption. There are other points I could make, but there are many speakers in this debate. We are very strongly in favour of this directive and hope that it will leave this House in a really strong form.

rapporteur
.  Mr President, I am a little uneasy about the proposal that my report on the immunity of Mr Gargani be brought forward. The Secretary-General of my Group stated that she would have liked to have had the opportunity to discuss that report, along with other reports, at our group meeting before the part-session. We understood the report was being deferred until the second December sitting in Strasbourg, and so we did not have the opportunity to discuss it. Furthermore, I learned that there was a defect in paragraph 2 of the report as it was adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, but I have not seen any of the adjustments to it. As I am the rapporteur, I would have liked to have seen such adjustments. On these grounds, with the greatest respect and with regret to my colleague, Mr Gargani, I ask that this matter be deferred until the next Strasbourg sitting.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I should like to address a theme raised by the President-in-Office of the Council which nobody else has yet spoken about but which, for more than one person in this House, is of great moment and significance. The President-in-Office mentioned that the question is being raised as to whether the minimum number of MEPs per state is too low. Is it wrong to retain a relatively low basic membership in a new and enlarging Union? Let us pause and reflect upon this. At the moment, in Britain  which is composed of three nations, England, Scotland and Wales  Wales is currently represented in this House by five Members. After the new Constitution comes into effect, if it does, the number of Members representing Wales in this House will drop to four. Malta will have five. I do not object at all to Malta having five Members: it is a fine thing for small countries to have proper representation. As a Scot, how could I think otherwise? We must not forget, however, that the principle of degressive proportionality has a deep justification. Degressive proportionality says that every state in this Union must be represented in this House by a sufficient number of MEPs so as fully to express the political diversity of that state. Rightly, therefore, even the 400 000 citizens of Malta should have at least five Members, but perhaps no more. If you insist, rightly, on keeping a maximum ceiling of membership, the upshot of increasing yet further the degressive proportionality threshold above five will be to cut the representation of significant parts of existing Member States. In the debates we had about the competences of the Union, Mr Lamassoure reminded the House of the importance of partner regions, countries like Flanders, Galicia, Euskadi and, indeed, Scotland. These are significant parts in the Union. If you cut their representation you deny them the degressive proportionality on which you rightly insist for countries such as Malta or Cyprus. Do not do that. This is not a trivial point. At the Convention, as a Member representing Scotland, I tried many times to alert colleagues to the significance of entrenching certain aspects of the common fisheries policy that are unacceptable to us. I was not heeded. The upshot of that is that it will be impossible for me, as a strong supporter of this idea of a European Constitution, to persuade my political colleagues in Scotland to back ratification of the text because I now know that on that point it will not be changed. My appeal was neglected. Had I been representing a larger force I might have been heard. What a pity! Do not neglect degressive proportionality for the components
 of the states of the Union in insisting on it for the states.

 Mr President, my report is on the proposal for tripartite contracts and agreements between the European authorities and the Member States, and local and regional authorities. This is, one might think, rather a mouthful for what is essentially a simple idea. The point is, as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy pointed out in its opinion on this matter, much of the implementation of important aspects of European policy  environmental policy, regional policy and other policies, including transport  is carried out in Member States at a level of government below that of the centralised state government. And yet there is a danger of inadequate connection between the Commission, at the centre, and local and regional government. Any steps that can be taken to improve these connections are greatly to be welcomed and much to be encouraged. The Commission's proposal on tripartite contracts and agreements is a proposal for precisely such an improvement, and therefore my Group strongly welcomes it. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and the Environment Committee also welcome it and wish to carry it forward. One of the first pilot arrangements in terms of a tripartite agreement was among cities. It was based on the idea of a sustainable city  for example Birmingham, Stockholm and other cities in the Union. It was about trying to figure out ways to make sustainability make sense. One of the interesting facts I discovered in reading a report on that pilot project was that the city of Birmingham could write to the central government in London and go for weeks or months without receiving a reply. Central governments in Member States are often very bad at maintaining adequate contact with local and city authorities and with city regions. If we are going to make progress in implementing policies in Europe, it is obvious that we must make sure there is interaction between central government, local government and government at the European level. It is important to stress  and I address in particular my friend and opponent Mr Bradbourn on this point  that this suggestion for tripartite contracts and agreements is not only a suggestion about regional government  of which I know Mr Bradbourn disapproves  it is also a suggestion about local government, of which I rather think he and his party strongly approve. We must ensure that there is real contact and connectivity and that we get things moving. Sometimes in this House we use the word 'region' in a very misleading sense. For example, Scotland, the constituency which I represent, is for some purposes called a region. But most of the inhabitants of Scotland think it is a nation within a multinational state. And Scotland itself has extremely varied regions. Only yesterday I was visiting the South of Scotland Partnership, who were discussing some of the particular problems facing the rural south of Scotland, which is very different  linguistically, culturally, socially and agriculturally  from central Scotland and from highland Scotland. They raised with me the problem of the town - the old borough. Nowadays it is very difficult to sustain small towns. Cities and regions have great identity but towns, in our local government system, have lost that. The sustainable city is currently being trialled as a pilot project. What about the sustainable town? We must look at governance in Europe at many levels: the region, the locality, and entities which are lower than the locality in terms of current governmental structures. All these things matter. The report adopted by the Constitutional Affairs Committee needs to be amended, not in such a way as to break the spirit of what was agreed in that Committee, but in a way that completes that spirit by building in some of the points agreed on by the Environment Committee, all of the points agreed on by the Legal Affairs Committee, and some of the things which have emerged from the pilot projects under way. I strongly commend the report in its amended form to the House, and I very much hope that it will be carried in the vote tomorrow.

 Mr President, I hope I will be forgiven for moving from matters of life and death to more commercial matters. This House, in its role as legislator, is deeply concerned about intellectual property and the need to protect holders' rights in the interests of consumers and of fair play. It is all the more alarming if the holders of the rights themselves abuse the rights to the disadvantage of consumers. I regret to say that this is what is being done now in Scotland by Diageo, the multinational spirit drinks producer, which produces Cardhu whisky. The supply of Cardhu single malt has run low. However, now Diageo is producing something called Cardhu pure malt whisky. Not all Members of this House may be aware of it, but there is a very big difference between pure malt whisky – which is a blend of various malts – and single malt, which comes from a single malt distillery. It is vital to the health of this Scottish and European industry that consumer trust is maintained and that sharp practice by producers is eliminated as quickly as possible. This industry has often sought and obtained the support of the European authorities. We should insist that they themselves play the game. Mr President, please write to the chief executive and get Diageo to stop this!

 Mr President, I share the opinion already expressed by many in this House. I have to say that during the Convention, in which I was proud to take part as an alternate member, I respected - though I did not always agree with - the positions taken by the United Kingdom Government representatives. They made their position clear, they sometimes took an unpopular stand, but on the whole they stood on a given ground and we reached a conclusion and compromises. Sometimes I would have liked them to have taken a different line, for example, a stronger line in relation to the unsatisfactorily readjusted sections on fisheries in parts I and III. As Mr Corbett bravely pointed out, although governments could have voiced reservations or come forward with different views on matters that were central to the discussion at the Convention, nothing was said. Both Mr Duff and Mr Méndez de Vigo made the point that these matters were extensively, not inadequately, discussed at the Convention. Now, suddenly, on the core issue of the budget, the ECOFIN Council and, I am afraid, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer with it, says that the Convention's entire proposal makes no sense and that a completely new order needs to be brought about. That, surely, is about the most unsatisfactory way of conducting things that can be imagined. I criticise the UK Government –
 it is not the only government at fault –
 but we should all be calling upon all governments involved to get their acts together and get this thing finished reasonably quickly and on the basis of the Convention.

 Mr President, I want to pay a compliment to the four speakers before me in the debate who took part in the negotiations on this interinstitutional agreement and particularly to commend, as Nick Clegg did, Monica Frassoni's report and its explanatory statement to the House. However, I want to slightly disagree with some of the points that have just been made. When we talk about better legislation, it seems to me that suddenly there descends upon this 21st Century parliament the feel that the late-18th Century Beccaria and Bentham walk the stage with us. Legislation is a science which can be improved, because we all know what the good of the human condition is and all we have to do is devise technical means to achieve it. We know, as Mr Medina Ortega has just said, that this is not, in fact, the case. The duties of the members of a democratic legislature are not to seek a single institutional view. The judges of the members of a democratic legislature are to address the dialectic of contemporary politics, to express the points upon which we disagree and not the points upon which we agree. Out of disagreement or debate comes perhaps, in the end, wisdom and decision, but we do not start out on the assumption that there is one right answer and it is a technical question of how to achieve it. Nor can we reasonably start out from the assumption that impact assessment is easy. We have 'legislation missiles' which make impact as they land and through that we can tell what the impact is. Everybody who has studied the sociology of law is well aware that this is not true. What legislation has actually brought about remains controversial for years after it has been passed. There are many strands in the effects of legislation. We do not even always agree on the juridical impact, far less the economic impact of legislation. A week or so ago, we had a huge argument about the Copyright Directive because people were not sure, not about the cost, but what it would actually mean in its implications before the courts of law. Legal certainty is a myth and an illusion. The most that good legislators can do is diminish legal uncertainty and we should approach our task with due modesty in that regard. That brings me back to the point about subsidiarity which matters to us all greatly. Impact assessment taken on the grand scale seems to suppose that all law impacts equally and in the same way on all parts of this vast and diverse Union. What an absurd view. It is not true. Every time you look at a real case, you find that it impacts differently in different places. This is what makes subsidiarity so important. I strongly commend Monica Frassoni's report and its explanatory statement. I shall vote for it, but I express some doubts about the underlying suppositions of this debate.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, many of the amendments - and certainly all those to which my group has given its name - are clearly and directly aimed at preventing any leakage from this directive into the patenting of computer software itself. That is very important to us. It is quite clear that a body of intellectual property law which protects computer software by copyright, and leaves patents for other purposes, works well from the point of view of the software industry, and of the creative minds which develop computer software. Neither Mrs McCarthy nor Mr Bolkestein disagrees with me on this point. Nobody wants a leakage resulting in the patenting of pure software. There is some risk that genuine inventions which involve a software element would not be adequately protected without a new directive. So be it. But then the burden of proof lies with the Commission to show us which of Parliament's proposed amendments would over-protect us against the risk that we see and under-protect against the danger which the Commissioner is anxious to avoid, namely the danger of 'real' inventions not being adequately patentable within the European Union. The strategy of those of us who are amending this directive is to prevent any leakage into software patents as such. That would be a real disaster. We have been lobbied heavily about this, but we have been lobbied heavily because we have very many able, hardworking constituents who see the leakage which I have mentioned as a threat to their livelihood. Let us be absolutely sure that what we send back from this debate and from tomorrow's vote - and Mrs McCarthy has worked very hard on this report - really does provide a completely watertight seal against such leakage and protects what Mr Bolkestein wants to protect without creating the danger which so many of us have been taught to apprehend by our constituents.

 Mr President, I was very happy that Parliament gave such resounding support to the Ebner report. My own ancestral languages in Scotland – Gaelic and Lowland Scots – have suffered severe discrimination and neglect over a couple of centuries. Indeed, as we know, many of the Gaelic speakers were driven out during the horrible period of the Highland Clearances. In these circumstances it is a matter for rejoicing that the annual National Gaelic Mod (Am Mòd Nàiseanta Rìoghail) will take place for the one hundredth time in the town of Oban this year. I am very glad to have a constituency office there. It is a great tragedy that the languages of Duncan Ban MacIntyre and Robert Burns have become more or less foreign languages to the children of Argyllshire and Ayrshire respectively, and other parts of Scotland. These are examples from one country of a universal European problem. I am very glad that at the Convention I had the chance to help put respect for linguistic diversity into the objectives of the Union, if we adopt the draft Constitution. The Charter of Fundamental Rights is helpful too. But we need proactive help and that is what the Ebner report promises. I hope that the Commission will take that up. I am very pleased with the result of that vote and to have taken part in it.

 Mr President, I am surprised that for once my political group is the first to be called in the debate. I recently had a long and interesting conversation in Scotland with the Consul General for India and we were reflecting upon the problems in trying to constitute a polity which is continental in scale and multilingual in character, with citizens of many faiths and of none, with memories of historical antagonism between religious communities and which tries to sustain a working democratic constitution and to live at peace with its neighbours. We were thinking both of Europe and of India and it is humbling to us in the European Union, as we work towards improving our constitution, to think that India has achieved this continent-wide polyglot democracy in a secular polity for more than 50 years now. We have a lot to learn from India and we should approach today's debate with a certain sense of humility in that regard. However, evidently, as the horrifying events in Mumbai show us, all is not well in India. The issue of the capability to sustain a secular state with religious tolerance is now before us, as is the question of whether the tension with Pakistan will be cooled and whether intercommunal relations in India will become peaceful. That sets the background to this admirable resolution which is before us today. Some of it in a sense merely states the obvious: of course we condemn the bomb attacks in Mumbai; of course we deplore the targeting of civilians; of course we feel great sympathy with the victims. We support the Indian Government in its fight against terrorism, but there is more to be said than that and some of it is said in my group's amendment to the resolution where we call for further steps to be taken to enforce Indian constitutional law properly and to prevent communal violence inside India. We are particularly aware, for example, of recent Amnesty International reports on problems in Gujarat and the responses to the 2002 massacre there. The Indian National Human Rights Commission has itself called for improved vigilance by the Indian authorities and for effective protection of constitutional rights. At the same time we welcome the Pakistani Government's assurance that it also deplores and has no time for the terrorist act in Mumbai. Times are critical, but we must also be critically sympathetic to the Indian state. Things are going wrong which will call for resolve in India to make them better. We should carry this resolution and the amendments to it tabled in the name of my group and of the ELDR Group.

 Mr President, following on from what Mr Fatuzzo said, it is worth remarking that the concept of 'region' is radically ambiguous. For example, when it comes to constitutional affairs the ancient nation of Scotland currently counts as a region of Europe. However, when it comes to the funds which we are discussing, Scotland itself has several extremely diverse regions. For example, the Highlands and Islands include some of the most isolated islands in Europe with extreme problems of transport because of weather and tidal conditions and the costs involved. The Highlands is one of the most underpopulated mountain regions in Europe. That contrasts with the Central region of Scotland and again with the Borders region, which is sparsely populated and has its own particular problems. I am delighted that what we did today in these two reports was to reject proposals for radical renationalisation of Structural Funds. The United Kingdom Government has been leading the charge on that. I was glad to see that the European Socialists, including the UK Labour Party, today apparently deserted Mr Brown's proposals about renationalisation. We came to good conclusions about the need to sustain structural funding at European level and to take seriously the problems of territorial cohesion and permanent geographical disadvantage.

 – Mr President, with regret I would like to raise the issue of whistle-blowing. I am referring to the case of a constituent of mine, Mr Robert Dougal Watt, who formerly worked for the Court of Auditors and who over a year ago communicated to many MEPs a deep concern about certain aspects of the conduct of business in the Court of Auditors. Subsequently he went on sick leave and following that he became subject to disciplinary proceedings. As his representative, I contacted the Secretary General of the Court of Auditors, not to express an opinion on the correctness or incorrectness of the points which Mr Watt had raised, but simply to draw to the attention of the Court that in my opinion, Mr Watt was, whether correct or incorrect, a public-spirited person acting for what he understood to be the public interest. He ought to be treated with the respect that is due to those who do so. I understand that subsequently the disciplinary board recommended that he be demoted, but, on 13th July 2003, I learned that he had just been dismissed. This is the first opportunity I have to mention to colleagues my profound distress at the matter. I believe that this House should look into the question of whether we have adequate protection for whistle-blowers in the European Union. The rules have been changed and tightened but I am not satisfied that the situation works satisfactorily and I say this with great regret. Those of us who believe most profoundly in the virtues of European integration have the greatest interest in ensuring that it is carried forward with unimpeachable integrity, taking into account the protection of individuals. (Applause)

 Mr President, at this late stage of the evening there is not much to be said, especially since we all agree on the virtues of the report and its underlying point. I just want to quickly address three principles. First of all, it is obvious that criminal law and criminal sanctions touch the liberty of citizens more closely than any other branch of the law and therefore, being absolutely certain that there is a valid constitutional basis for the use of criminal law is vital to liberty as a fundamental matter of the rule of law. One of the things that the report and its explanatory statement do is to show exactly to what extent there is a basis. Secondly, in a democratic Community, it is essential that the citizens' representatives get to vote on the question of whether the criminal law should be extended. That alone would cause us to regard Pillar III as a very suspect basis for any kind of intervention in the criminal law. It effectively excludes the democratic representatives of the citizens in this Parliament beforehand and in the national parliaments afterwards. Therefore it is excellent to discover, as Mr Koukiadis shows, that it is a matter for the Community Pillar. I should to like to underline the point in paragraph 7 about subsidiarity and proportionality. Again, it sends a message to the Member States to improve their criminal law in an appropriate way and to allow sensitivity to local traditions in law. That is absolutely vital. Those are three important principles in an excellent report. I welcome Mr Bolkestein back from his brief sojourn in Scotland, where he was very welcome.

 Mr President, as a member of the Convention I noticed that very early on it became a commonplace – at least certain governments tried to make it so – that the six-monthly rotation of the presidency of the Council leads to inefficiency, a loss of momentum, a loss of direction and, sotto voce
, that if too many small countries have the presidency it will not work. I congratulate the Greek Presidency most sincerely for having shown that this is completely false. It has been the case during the last five years that the small-country presidencies have proved to be models of how this system can work. We should take pride and pleasure in that and congratulate the Greek Presidency on it. Last Friday, at a meeting in London, a document produced by the London Office of the European Parliament remarked that the Convention was proposing that the Council should have a permanent, powerful presidency. Anybody who believes that ought to have a look at the draft text. The presidency of the Council will have no constitutional powers. The Council is denied any power of legislating. The Council may – and ought to – have influence, but the idea that the presidency will be 'powerful' is a great mistake. Since it will be a presidency chairing a meeting of prime ministers and heads of states, it will not be so much a case of primus inter pares 
as of less than par inter primos
, unlike the position of the President of the Commission in future, for which again I am glad. Although we have rightly heard a certain sense of alarm about the dual presidency, it may not be as bad as it sounds, like the music of Wagner. At the Convention I had the honour of representing – as alternate member – the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and in particular the European Free Alliance subset representing the stateless nations of Europe – the small countries. I rejoice, as I said the other day, to see the flags of the new countries that come in. But not all the little countries of Europe are as yet – or intended to be – Member States of Europe. It is therefore vitally important to ask ourselves, as we contemplate a new constitution for Europe, about the future position of Catalonia (comparable in size to Hungary), of Scotland (comparable in size to the Slovak Republic), of Galicia or Wales (comparable in size to Latvia). What will be the way in which this Union works? Mr de Gaulle was happy to pour contempt on the idea of subsidiarity. If we do not recognise that this is going to have to be a Europe of democracy at many levels, which takes subsidiarity seriously and takes it in a transitive sense right through the Member States, to all the countries of Europe, it will not work. I hope that will not be the case.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, there are some points I would like to underline in supporting what Mr Lehne said at the beginning of this debate. First, and most importantly, we are dealing with a matter of great public concern, but a matter that has been in the public domain for a long time. We are dealing with a course of events which Mr Cohn-Bendit has not merely not denied but has also publicly avowed. We are dealing with a course of events in respect of which Mr Cohn-Bendit was specifically praised by the trial court involved in the trial of Mr Klein some years ago, where the court drew attention to the courage and public spirit of the people who had assisted in getting that particular accused person to come out of hiding and give himself up to the public authorities. So this is not a case of somebody seeking surreptitiously to hide from accusations or from public justice, but of somebody who has openly avowed his actions. Mr Lehne was absolutely right to say that there can be no question of the public prosecutors in Frankfurt being themselves in any way deviously motivated. They have a public duty to take up a complaint that has been laid before them on ostensibly justifiable grounds. However, it does not follow that those who laid the accusation before the public prosecutors, thereby triggering that public duty, were themselves wholly lacking in any deviousness of motive. When account is taken of two aspects of the public interest here today – firstly, that there ought not to be unreasonable protection of MEPs or anybody else from public prosecution where circumstances warrant it and, secondly and importantly, that electoral debate and discussion should be able to go forward without unreasonable impediment or harassment of leading figures in it – the balance of the public interest in this case seems to be absolutely clear: the public prosecutors are doing their duty and we should do ours. In this case, that duty points clearly in the direction indicated by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to decline waiving the immunity.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
),  
rapporteur
. – Mr President, this is one of those cases concerning the immunity of a Member of Parliament which raises in a very sharp form the issue of the immunity or non-immunity of Members when they are indulging in political activity outside Parliament. It is very clear law that expressions of opinions or votes cast in this House can never be the subject of legal action or prosecution anywhere. That is an essential part of the liberty of discussion in a democratic assembly. However, in the course of their duties, Members of this House often indulge in political speech and political activity elsewhere, most particularly in their own constituencies and in their home state – for example at party congresses. The case we have before us concerning Mr Camre arises from a speech at his party congress in Denmark in 2001, shortly after the desperate events of 11 September. In the course of a speech to his party congress, Mr Camre made some very strong and, in my personal judgment, highly offensive remarks about Muslims living in the West. All the countries of the West, he said, are infiltrated by Muslims and some of them speak nicely to us while they are waiting to become sufficiently numerous to get rid of us, as they have done in Sudan, Indonesia, Nigeria and the Balkans. There are other similar or even more unpleasant remarks. Under Danish criminal law, section 226 b of the Danish Criminal Code, it is an offence to make statements constituting derisory and humiliating treatment of a group of people. In this case the accusation is that the statements made were derisory and humiliating treatment of people in Denmark, namely people of Muslim belief or family background. Under European law, the position is that a Member of this House, acting in his home state, enjoys the same immunity from prosecution and legal intervention as would a Member of the home parliament. Under the Danish constitution, a Member accused of a criminal offence such as this enjoys immunity from prosecution unless the Folketing – the parliament – waives that immunity. We are informed that normally the Folketing would waive immunity in a case of this kind. However, the European Parliament has always rightly said that we must have a common set of principles concerning the waiver of immunity that apply to all MEPs in all countries. Therefore, the issue is not would the Danish Parliament waive immunity? but ought this Parliament to waive immunity in a case of this kind? where the words complained of are certainly to any ordinary judgment very offensive – to put it mildly – but where they are also unquestionably statements made in the course of a political activity. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market instructed me – rightly – to look into the whole range of the precedents, the decisions that this House has taken about immunity in these sorts of situations. It became clear to the officials who looked into it, and myself, that Parliament has a universal practice of declining to waive immunity in the context of prosecutions where what is involved is a prosecution of matters which are directly the content of a Member's political activity. That being so, while I have to say that I myself have extreme disgust for the remarks that were made, I consider it to be my duty as rapporteur, and in any event it is the unanimous opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee, that in this case the Parliament ought to inform the Danish authorities that it declines to waive the immunity of Mr Camre and I so recommend. I must say, as I reviewed the case law, it did seem to me personally – and this is a purely personal opinion – that it might be that over the years we have cast the net of parliamentary immunity rather wide. It would not be appropriate or just to use an individual case arbitrarily to change the practice, but it might be worth the Committee on Constitutional Affairs reviewing the question of how far we ought to expect parliamentary immunity to extend, how far we should wish it to. I believe it would be appropriate for the Constitutional Affairs Committee to consider this if in due course it were invited to do so. But that is a separate issue. There is no doubt that the required course of justice in upholding the long-standing principles and case law of this Parliament is to decline to waive immunity in this case.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 –
 Mr President, it is a very important matter that we discuss tonight, as Mr Bolkestein said. He urged us, in his closing words, to make sure that we modernise and simplify European Community law and endow it with appropriate flexibility. With this I believe we can all agree. The issue is: which exact text will best achieve that? To establish the general orientation of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we thought that the Commission's original proposal was unduly timid and grudging on points such as the environmental and social points. We, and others in Parliament, urged a broader and more generous view – the one that was in due course confirmed by the Court of Justice in the Helsinki tramways case. That was a real advance. It was not just our view, but Parliament's view at first reading. Then we have the common position. To us, the common position seems to be in some measure a retreat from the high-water mark represented by Parliament's first reading position. We would like to see some aspects of that retreat again reversed. I accept Mr Bolkestein's point that the text, as it came to us from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, is internally inconsistent. I would put that down to the fact that in committee we had an unstable and varying majority, which meant that there was no clear golden thread running through the text that came from the committee. But there is a way of restoring it to consistency, coherence and environmental and social sensibility, which is to adopt the string of amendments, which will pull it back towards Parliament's first reading position and again exhort the Council and the Commission to take a bold step that will continue to serve these valuable goals of modernisation, simplification and flexibility. My own group will put forward two amendments in particular relating to Article 53 where, for example, we will object to the idea that it must be a tender most economically advantageous for the contracting authorities. We are told that sometimes social or environmental criteria are vague. That seems to be fraught with vagueness – the insistence that it be, as it were, self-referentially back to the authority which is contracting. That would give rise to all manner of disputes. Leave it as we suggest: various criteria linked to the subject of the public contract in question. Do not leave out characteristics, including those relating to production methods or the tender as equal-treatment policy. If these are unacceptably vague then the whole of Community law is unacceptably vague because we are exhorted in the horizontal clauses of the Treaties to attend to these very values! Let us be brave! Let us go forward, colleagues! Let us restore the kinds of values that we asserted in the first reading position. Let us get rid of the inconsistencies, but let us get rid of them in the right direction.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, I represent as you say, a composite group in this, the Group of the Greens and the European Free Alliance, and I would like to thank personally Jo Leinen very much for his colleaguely courtesy and goodwill in carrying out this work. Undoubtedly, unlike Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I think that what has been produced is a genuine attempt at a compromise and one which I believe a majority of my Group will be happy to accept, although other colleagues who will speak in the debate will draw attention to particular points of concern. From the point of view of the European Free Alliance which I particularly represent here, there are, however, genuine concerns about the way in which the criteria are chosen: the way in which one specifies what counts. Currently in this Parliament, the European Free Alliance represents a wide range of what we would think of as distinct countries within the European Union – Andalusia, the Basque Country, Catalonia, Flanders, Galicia, Scotland and Wales, to take them in alphabetical order in the English language – but of course, from the point of view of a criterion based upon States, that is only three States. When I look at the new flags beautifully adorning the podium there, I see that there are flags of many countries which are present or future Member States and which are actually, in terms of either territory or population or both, considerably smaller than the countries I have mentioned. So the kind of movement in thought – and it is a European movement in thought – which the European Free Alliance represents is actively discriminated against by a criterion specified simply in terms of a proportion of the total number of Member States. That really is something that needs to be reflected upon. A Parliament of this kind and a Union of this kind must have a very particular regard for the interests of minorities and for fairness to minorities and the rights of smaller groups. I know that the compromise has aimed to move in our direction and I appreciate that very much, but the fact of the matter is that there is still a serious difficulty from the point of view of this genuine European tide of opinion. The European Free Alliance has been recognised for a long time as one of the original Europe-wide political families, and yet we will stand on the margins of being excluded and de-recognised under these proposals. I am afraid we cannot support them in this form.

 President Pat Cox at the opening of today's session indicated that MEPs obliged to depart for Brussels on Convention business might lodge a statement of their position on the Member's Statute despite their necessary absence from the vote. Here is mine: With regret, I am unable to support the draft Statute of Members in the form in which Parliament adopted it on 3 June. I would therefore have voted against today's legislative resolution, and as shadow rapporteur I advised my Group in this sense. I am unable to go along with the rejection of the 'Belgium compromise' amendment that would have allowed national income tax on an MEP's salary, and the rejection of a strong statement on a revised and transparent expenses system. I also have grave reservations about the sweeping provisions suggested for Members' immunity.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, on a point of order, I hope I may be forgiven for raising two relatively domestic matters. Firstly, when I arrived I found my office was furnace-like in its heat: this is not the first time this has happened, but it is particularly acute today. It is really not appropriate to ask MEPs or their assistants to work in these conditions. The air conditioning system does not appear to be working properly. We set standards all the time which we expect other people to live up to, but the standards in these premises are not adequate. It is not fair to ask our colleagues and employees to work in conditions like that. Could we not get something done to improve it? Secondly, I cannot be the only one who is increasingly distressed by the amount of often off-colour or even obscene unsolicited email that keeps pouring through the system. Again, it adds an awful lot of work to colleagues who have to delete it every day. I hope we can get something done to make the email system work as it is intended to do – for effective communication and not for that sort of fearful junk!
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, I only partly agree with Mr Krarup. I agree with him in the sense that there is a democratic crisis. This Parliament is in a crisis because we come under permanent attack by many of the public media in all the Member States for the indefensible state in which we are made to work at the moment. We all know that people in this House doing exactly the same job are paid a huge range of different salaries for it. There is only one thing which has made this tolerable. That has been an expenses regime which would otherwise be totally indefensible because it is absolutely untransparent. We are greatly indebted to Mr Rothley for bringing us so far down the road. We must take the step that will make it possible for this Parliament to stand tall and stand legitimate with a proper scheme on a common salary and a common, defensible and transparent expenses regime. Putting it quite simply, I would like to see to it that we have a system that can be understood, that pays people the costs they incur and that pays us all a fair day's wage for a fair day's work. It should be slightly smaller but it would just have been gesture politics to retable the amendment we put in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market since it was obviously not going to be carried. I respectfully disagree with Mr Rothley on the issue of privileges and immunities. I would like to see it in the Statute in something like the way he suggests, but frankly the provisions there strike me as much too sweeping, covering far too much. Immunity in these Berlusconi days is a difficult concept and we should not challenge our electorate. It is better to stick with the regime that we have, with the primary law that we currently have. Most of the amendments that we, the liberals and others have put forward seek to keep that basis for immunities. With these crucial amendments, the resolution can be carried. Finally, with great respect to everybody here, I do not regard myself here as an employee of the European Union: I am a representative of my constituents. I do not ever wish to pay tax on my income at a different level or on a different basis from my constituents. The permissive Belgian compromise that would let Member States bring a Member's taxation liability to the level of his constituents is a good one. I hope that we can find a way of making it legally valid.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 – 
Mr President, like all my group I essentially welcome this proposal and the opportunity to speak on its behalf. As my friend Mr Lannoye said, it is, if not 'too little, too late', at any rate 'not very much and rather late'. But it is a step in the right direction and it is very important to establish the polluter pays principle. After all, most human activities have some impact on the environment. The issue is who tidies up afterwards – the person who causes it or somebody else? Like many members of this House I have received powerful representations from local authorities in my own constituency in Scotland, saying that if this directive is not carried local authorities and other public bodies will continue to have to deal, out of general tax revenues, with the problems which other people ought either to have prevented in the first place or be dealing with at present. It is worth reminding ourselves that the polluter pays principle is only half the story. The fact of the matter is that those who pollute are engaged in economic activities producing goods or services which other people want to buy, presumably at the price at which they are offered. If the polluter does not pay, the problem is that the price is too low and consumers get a kind of a free lunch for which they then have to pay afterwards in their capacity as taxpayers. We must try to ensure, therefore, that we have a regime which is genuinely directed at those producers and activities which can take better precautions and adequately insure against liability so that the pressure of insurance premium liabilities and the cost of insurance premiums reward those who are most careful and push up prices for those who are least careful, thereby creating a virtuous circle. With regard to that issue, I have had much doubt throughout the debates about the so-called state-of-the-art and permit defences, as there is a rationale which says that people should be able to work closely to the terms of, for example, a carefully designed permit and thereby guarantee themselves against liability. On the whole though, I have come to the view expressed in Amendment No 104 that these matters should be treated as matters of litigation rather than matters of exemption, which is a reasonable compromise to reach, so we very strongly support the directive on condition that the relevant amendments are carried.

MEPs sensitive to the views of their constituents share their grave concern about the menace of drugs and drug trafficking to our young people and to our societies in general. The police and prosecuting authorities, the courts, and the prison services bear a heavy burden in seeking to uphold and enforce the law and to protect our citizens from this menace. They deserve our support and they certainly have mine. We are faced today with a proposal to review objectively the question whether the UN Conventions of 1961, 1971, and 1998 relating to drugs are working effectively. It may be that, after full inquiry, the international community should adopt new approaches in relation to certain problems and anomalies. Whether this should happen or not depends on the evidence. We need an inquiry to establish which way the evidence points. Unilateral departure from the Conventions would, by contrast, be quite unacceptable. The law must be firmly upheld both nationally and internationally until such time, if any, as it is amended for considered reasons. On this ground I voted for the Buitenweg Report, and I previously signed Mr Cappato's declaration which provided the occasion for the Report. As Mr Cappato is well aware, I am not dogmatically pre-committed to the solutions he recommends.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

. – To participate in peacefully reuniting a once fractured Europe is a remarkable privilege. I voted for this with great satisfaction today. As a representative of the Scottish National Party, I was also very conscious that many small countries, which only recently re-established their independence, were among those we voted in today. By contrast, however, Scotland, one of the most ancient small nations in Europe, remains no more than a 'region' of a Member State as things are viewed from Brussels. In this new enlarged Europe, Scotland must surely aspire to more than that. The people of Scotland will pass a judgement about that on 1 May in the Scottish Parliamentary election. Enlargement from the outside is taking place. It may also take place from the inside. As the European Convention proceeds towards its conclusion, it seems clear that a future constitution will place no barrier in the way of internal enlargement. I hope this process will commence soon.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, it was a matter of huge satisfaction, I am sure to yourself as well as to myself, that the resolution on the crisis in the fishing sector was carried by such a vast majority as 508 to 7, with 27 abstentions. That really does represent a ringing endorsement by the European Parliament of the need to take decisive steps to give assistance to an industry which is in crisis and nowhere more so, as you well know, than in Scotland at the present time. I recently visited Eyemouth in the south of Scotland and will shortly visit both Oban and Campbeltown on the west coast. These are communities gravely affected by this crisis, but even worse is the situation in the north of Scotland. If we cannot do things adequately to help that industry it will collapse. Thus even when the cod stocks are restored, there will be no viable industry to go out and catch them. This is a vital part of a sustainable diet for Europeans in the future. We must have an adequate fishing industry. We must support it properly and, if we put up the money, our government in the United Kingdom must take it up. It has been said that they will not go cap in hand to the Commission looking for money. This is not cap in hand. The money is willingly being offered. Let it be taken up.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, we have just heard the latest act of that great opera ‘Così fa Fatuzzo’! More seriously, I sit here as a representative of Scotland in the European Parliament, and we have had the opportunity to debate and vote on the substance of the issue of the Iraq emergency. Our colleagues in the Scottish Parliament have also done so. Those at Westminster, shamefully, will be denied that opportunity even if a decision is made by Tony Blair to commit their constituents to war in Iraq. My commitment to this Parliament's resolution of this morning is unequivocal, above all as to its central point. There can be no lawful armed invention in Iraq without express United Nations authority. It is not enough for George W. Bush or Tony Blair to be satisfied that there has been a material breach of resolution 1441. Only if the Security Council so finds, and only if it resolves that action is to be taken, may action lawfully occur. I am glad to see that the article by the Prime Minister in today's Times effectively confirms that. We look to the United Nations inspectors to oversee effective disarmament by Iraq or to establish its clear breach of the resolution. They will need time for that. If this is old Europe, then old Europe stands up for the rule of law and for the peaceful resolution of conflict wherever possible. That is surely right.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, like other speakers, I am glad that in relation to the Napolitano report we have moved forward on some important points. It is recognised that, in appropriate constitutional circumstances, regions will have access to the Court of Justice. It is recognised rather clearly and in good terms that the principle of subsidiarity is iterative and applies down the line, not just between the Union of the Member States, but to the regions and local authorities as well. There are some points I regret. I particularly regret that the opportunity was not taken to comment about the odd composition of the Committee of the Regions. In future, for example, it seems probable that there will be five Members from Malta in the Committee of the Regions, as against 21 from Spain and 24 from the United Kingdom. That means that there will likely be five times as many Maltese as Galicians in the Committee of the Regions, if any Galicians get there at all – or Catalans or Scots. This is not a satisfactory situation. The Committee of the Regions is supposed to counterbalance the Parliament. The balance of populations and regions on the Committee of the Regions is not at all a reasonable one. This report will not convince those in my party at home who think that being an independent Member State would be better than being a constitutional region, as things stand.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, I also want to express my gratitude and satisfaction that the Parliament is today debating this report on an initiative which came from Mr Napolitano himself. Of course my group prefers the report in what we regard as the strengthened form in which it emerged from the committee, but which on some points Mr Napolitano thinks was pushed too far. No doubt that will be where the votes will be concentrated on Wednesday. However, it is a matter of common consensus that democracy in the European Union is necessarily democracy at many levels. The principle of subsidiarity is an iterative principle which works down the line and which should, as far as possible, enable people with local knowledge to apply that local knowledge, with common sense, to local circumstances, taking account of the purposes of the European legislation in question. It is often said that a characteristic of the European method of legal interpretation is its purposive quality, and I feel that to some extent the local enforcers of European law should act with regard to the purpose not only to the letter of the law. That is not to say that I wish to see a different law operating in different parts of Europe, but it is difficult to have the same law operating identically where there are very different circumstances. For example, very arid countries will necessarily apply the same water law in a somewhat different way than very wet countries because the circumstances that lead to the application of the law vary and these need to be taken into account. That surely is important. Another important matter is that the transposition of the directive should take account of the local circumstances; it is yet more important that the protocol on subsidiarity should encourage local and regional authorities to exercise a constructive discretion in enabling the directive to make the most possible sense at local level. There are other points that have been raised which we think are vital as well. The regional authorities should on occasion be able to take matters to the Court of Justice. Just at the moment, in Scotland, the government, the Scottish Executive, the opposition parties, are all of the view for example that a recent compromise reached at the Fisheries Council violates the principle of proportionality. Why should it be left to the fishing people to test that? Why cannot the regional authority responsible for enforcing the law test it itself? Many other such examples sprint to mind. There should also be opportunities to take things into account during the legislative process and before it. The EFA parties which I represent here do not just represent regions. Of course the countries we represent are regions in the technical constitutional sense. However it should not be forgotten – and Mr Lamassoure in his famous remarks about partner regions was not forgetting it – they are also among the ancient nations of Europe which deserve to be taken seriously. If it comes out of this Parliament, or out of the Convention, that there is nothing for a region between being a Member State and being nothing, then you know what answer you will get.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Just for confirmation, according to the final draft agenda, the vote is not tomorrow as Mr Méndez de Vigo implied, but on Wednesday. It has been changed back to tomorrow? Right, we need Amendment No 24 very quickly then.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 in writing
. – Today's resolution about the Copenhagen Summit congratulated the Government of Denmark for sustaining an excellent Council presidency, and for enabling us to celebrate today the largest enlargement in the history of the Union. This brings in ten new states, most of them relatively small, including six which have recently achieved independence by democratic means. We in Scotland are frequently told that as a small country we would have no great standing in Europe if we were likewise to achieve independence in Europe through democratic departure from a larger union. During the current fisheries negotiations, on the other hand, we have been warned not to expect too much since the UK lacks solid allies in Europe. There are five million Danes and five million Scots. I salute the huge achievement of one of the ancient small nations of Europe. I look forward to the day when my own ancient nation can play a similar role. The idea that small states count for nothing while large ones can cut the mustard has been shown up for the nonsense it is. My vote was motivated by these thoughts, as well as by a great satisfaction at seeing this greater Union safely achieved.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, I understand it is not possible to request a change, but may one protest against a change made by the Conference of Presidents? Today we should have been debating the Napolitano report on the role of regional and local authorities in European integration. It is a vitally important issue, and Parliament should have been ready to give its opinion on this to the Convention before the end of this year. For example, this week the Fisheries Council is debating cod stocks and the common fisheries policy. Scotland, which is hugely interested in that, at the moment has a walk-on role. The role of the regions in Europe matters deeply to people all over Europe and this Parliament has, by a stitch-up between the big parties, declined to debate it, although we have had it before us since July. It is outrageous that this has been taken off the agenda.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, this is a very acceptable suggestion, but there is a risk that, yet again, the Members' general opportunity to question the Commission at question time will be curtailed. Will question time be extended by a compensatory period please?
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, in reply to Mr Seppänen's point, I do not know many civil services in the world which are appointed only after a hearing by the Parliament and have to acquire the confidence of the Parliament to take office or which are dismissible as a college by Parliament. That is one of the important features of the situation as it obtains at the moment. As Mr Prodi has said, what we are looking for is a supranational democracy in Europe and that will be, in important ways, a democracy sui generis
, not exactly like that of any pre-existing state or society. I welcome a lot of what he has said today about the way the Commission should take office and hold office. This is an attempt to retain the kind of balance between the three institutions which ought to characterise Europe and which does not at the moment in anything like the same way characterise many of our Member States, where the government has become the controller of the legislature of the parliament rather than the other way around. That is a good feature of his proposals. Although Mr Hänsch has pointed very accurately to some difficulties and potential contradictions that will mean that these proposals have to be more fully thought through to deal with the question, what about the risks of deadlock in the system which you are suggesting? Another point that picks up what Mr Poettering said and which nobody else has spoken of is that a European democracy must be a democracy at many levels. One of the great disappointments of the Convention so far has been the tiny attention it has given to those levels of democracy which exist within and below the level of the Member State. If we do not take account, adequately and properly, of substantial constitutional regions with legislative powers - the internal nations of the Member States - then this Union will not work as a successful democracy. Mr Napoletano has prepared a report today to the Constitutional Affairs Committee of this Parliament. We have amended it in committee and we believe that we have strengthened it. He is not fully happy with all that we have reached there but I hope that the Commission and the Convention are going to listen to this because if they do not also attend to this vital level of democracy in Europe all will fail. (Applause)
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, I just want to endorse what my friend and colleague, Mr Hudghton, has said and indeed to endorse many of the things which Catherine Stihler said as well. In this area a great deal of the discussion among us remains bedevilled by different understandings of the legal background, in particular, of the continuing effects of the Spanish and Portuguese Treaty of Accession of 1985. That does need testing in a legal way and not just by political debate in the Parliament. I would like to take some steps to push that forward. As I mentioned yesterday, it does show one of the kinds of areas in which it would be very fruitful if it were the case that regions with legislative power had the right to seize the Court of Justice of questions because, after all, a parliament like the Scottish Parliament, which has legislative responsibility for these matters, should be able to test out the question of the legal basis and so should the Parliament of Galicia, might I add. This is not a particularly one-country point. It is to do with the thought that these are issues of law as well as of politics and we should be thinking of good ways of getting the law finally determined by a judicial authority.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, I would just like to express my profound sympathy with what Mr Nogueira Román has said. We, in Scotland, recently in the case the Braer
 disaster suffered a similar misfortune. But that is not what I wanted to speak about tonight. I would like to mention the currently hot issue about access to the Court of Justice, especially rights of semi-privileged access in the case of regions with legislative powers. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs discussed that last week and it will come before us in a fortnight's time as a hotly controversial point. Tonight's debate on fisheries brings up an interesting example which shows what the reality of the issue is. There are big risks for Scottish fisheries of the kind which Mr Nogueira in a different sense has alluded to. It could be that we want to raise an issue about the legality of current proposals under the primary law relating to the accession of Spain and Portugal. That really ought to be something which can be taken up by the legislature and executive which deal with this problem as a matter of European law, then the Scottish Parliament and Executive. Only if we get appropriate rights of access to the courts will that sort of question be answered in the proper place.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, to clarify this matter I would like the words 'and their constitutional regions' inserted after 'Member States'. This is a matter of real concern in many parts of Europe, including Scotland.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
), 
 in writing
. – I proposed an oral amendment to this resolution. I wanted to make it clear that within countries like Scotland and other so-called 'constitutional regions' there must be protection against concentrations of media ownership that threaten fair and pluralistic public debate. In Scotland today, there is a serious risk that the owners of The Scotsman
 newspaper may purchase its chief rival The Herald
. Other similar regions have similar concerns, for example Catalonia, the Basque Country and Wales. The serried ranks of British conservatism, together with their EPP allies, blocked the oral amendment that would have given a high profile to this aspect of media freedom. That lies upon their conscience. Even without the oral amendment, the resolution makes a vital point about the relationship between free media and real democracy. I therefore voted for it.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, on a point or order, I am following on from what Mr van Hulten said concerning Wednesday, 4 December. As a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I am well aware of the constitutional and practical importance of moving forward with the Statute of Members – even though I would not myself have chosen this particular way of doing it. However, I note that on the agenda for that day there are major debates on fisheries – the first for ten years – looking at the fisheries industry of Europe at a critical time. Constituents all over Europe will wonder what the European Parliament is thinking and doing about that. What the newspapers will tell them is that Parliament delayed discussing it until it had talked about its own pay. This is a scandalous state of affairs. I hope that if the Conference of Presidents persists with this agenda in this form it will change the order and bring the fisheries matter – which is of utmost importance – before and ahead of the debate on the Statute of Members. (Applause)
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, I want to put my voice mainly on the side of what Mr Harbour, Commissioner Bolkestein and others have said about the need to develop and improve the single market, particularly in the context of services and patents and other matters which have been discussed. We must, however, bear in mind that the confidence of our fellow citizens in this process also depends on proper observation of what you might call boundary conditions. For example, the single market could clearly be pursued in a way which ignored environmental side constraints. That is not happening, but it is vital that this situation be sustained. The same applies for certain social conditions and constraints. In relation to services, there is a nervousness among our citizens about public services and services of general interest. To what extent are these fully exposed to the single market conditions and to what extent are they properly kept aside? I was looking today at Commission document COM(2002) 208 and just reflecting on what we mean by services of general interest. I note the following definition, at 3.1.5: 'services of general interest are defined in the Commission Communication on ‘services of general interest in Europe’ as being services which the public authorities class as being of general interest and subject to specific public service obligations'. I do not think I have ever come across such a fine exercise in tautology in a public document. A service is a service of general interest if the public authorities say that it is in the general interest, and that is how they define it. Now, what that suggests is a certain conceptual lack of clarity. We have a notion that there is an area here which is subject to different conditions and constraints from that aspect of the market in services which lies fully in the private sector. If we do not get that right, we will definitely lose the confidence of our citizens. I have a large mailbag dealing with the fears people are now expressing about the way in which the general agreement on trade and services might be likely to go and the effect that could have on public services in Europe. As well as being clear about the need to extend and improve the single market and what the limiting conditions are, let us try to get out of the realm of tautology and into clear thought.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, on a point of order, on Monday I raised a point of order about Rule 2 and yesterday had the Minutes corrected to indicate the exact purport of that point. In my remarks on Monday I suggested that there was a risk of a certain meeting of Pesca Ministers having been intended to interfere with the independence of action of Parliament. Mr Jové Peres was one of the rapporteurs in question and he made a statement this morning. I fully accept what he said and if I caused him embarrassment I would like to apologise. (Applause)
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, might I draw attention to Item 12 of the Minutes, dealing with one-minute speeches on matters of political importance. My name appears twice in that list, but Members present will recall that I specifically made a point of order, concerning rule 2 of our Rules of Procedure. I therefore think that this should have been recorded as a point of order, while the point that I was making should be recorded in the Minutes.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
),  
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
 – On behalf of the Committee Legal Affairs and the Single Market, I want to draw attention to those items affecting the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance. It is not possible to sit through this process without realising how many desirable projects for expenditure the European Union has and that, with finite resources, all budgets have to be trimmed here and there, but Members must give very particular attention to the problem of our two courts. The EU succeeds in being a Union under law only to the extent that it has an effective set of judicial tribunals. This Parliament has the ambition that the Charter of Rights shall become judicially cognisable. This is a highly desirable project but one which will put heavy demands on the judicial resources of the European Union. The Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance both believe that they have reached the limit of their resources and that without adequate funding they will cease to be able to provide what the European Union needs. The European Union needs efficient, well-working courts without undue delays, without delays in court dockets. Because we are a polyglot, multilingual union, there must be speedy, clear and accurate translation of the courts' judgments into all the languages of the European Union in order that citizens and their legal advisers throughout the European Union are up-to-date on the law of this Union and how it is properly interpreted. If we do not reinstate the estimates that the Court of Justice itself made, we will fail more and more often. There are very specific points: we need referendaires 
in the Court of First Instance because the European Union has failed to fill vacancies for judges, we need upgraded posts and we need improved translation services. That is what the amendments by the Legal Affairs Committee amount to.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, on a point of order. As you know, Rule 2 states that Members of the European Parliament shall exercise their mandate independently, they shall not be bound by any instructions and shall not receive a binding mandate. I have heard on good authority that there was a meeting of the Pesca Group of Fisheries Ministers in Portugal on or around 15 September 2002, that is to say the Fisheries Ministers of Spain, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy and Portugal. I have further heard that at that meeting there was some discussion of three draft European Parliamentary reports, one by Mr Jové Peres and two by Mr Varela. If this is the case then that seems to me to be a most scandalous attempt to violate the independence of Members of this House in carrying out their functions as rapporteurs. I would ask you to draw it to the attention of the presidency of the Council that such behaviour by sections of the Council is unacceptable, and to ask the Chairman of our own Fisheries Committee that he should ask his rapporteurs to ensure that they act with independence as rapporteurs for this House.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, on a point of order, from the reply you gave me you have misunderstood the point I wanted to make. I totally agree with you that this House should always be delighted when the Council as such pays attention to our reports. However, the point to which I was drawing attention is that a subset of Council, the Pesca Group, is said to have held a meeting in which it discussed drafts of reports to this Parliament which have not yet been seen by the committee; in other words, that they have been "cooking up" reports ahead of their being seen by the committee. If true, that would be a grave infringement of the rights and privileges of this House and a breach, in effect, of Rule 2 of our Rules of Procedure. I wish to lodge a protest about that and suggest that it be taken up with the Presidency of the Council and with the chairman of our own Committee on Fisheries.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Following up Mr Titley's point, could I ask whether the Council would look seriously at the question of critically considering methodologies of impact assessment? In the years when I had something to do with this in an academic capacity, it was notorious that it was extremely difficult within the sociology of law to find reliable ways of assessing the impact of legislation which was in force. Predicting the impact of legislation which is going to come into force is yet more difficult. Does the President-in-Office agree with me that it would be wise for the Council to look into issues of methodology before we embark on expensive projects of this kind?
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, this is an important piece of legislation which will really help to improve and consolidate the single market by ensuring that we do not have excessive cross-border differences about sales promotion rules. It is justifiably a regulation because it simply removes certain sorts of bans on sales promotions while leaving it to the states to pursue their own particular legal, economic and political preference in other cases. So in this sense it is an important contribution to the consolidation of the single market and my group will support it in much the same spirit and also support much the same amendments as Mrs McCarthy has just done on behalf of the PSE. I would like to stress a few points. First of all, this is not an attack on consumer protection. Indeed some of the amendments make it absolutely clear that we want to see the maximum liberty of sales promotions that is consistent with proper consumer protection laws. Secondly, there is a degree of concern about the fate of small businesses faced with large retail organisations whose forms of sales promotion may be thought to encourage the closing down of the corner shop and the aggrandisation of the supermarket. We are certainly against that and we underline in the amendments we support and in those we supported in committee that the sales promotion laws must be seen to be wholly in conformity with competition law and with the avoidance of abuse of dominant position in markets. Given these safeguards, including the safeguards for minors, my group will with great goodwill vote for this measure today.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, it was a matter of great satisfaction to us all that the Medina Ortega report was adopted by such a decisive majority. It really is an important issue for many of our constituents to regulate better the timeshare industry and related activities. Many people in the European Union – and certainly many of my own constituents – have had serious complaints about fraudulent behaviour and mistreatment at the hands of sharks operating in this market. This is very unfortunate because there are many honest, decent and appropriate operators, for example those represented by the Organisation for Timeshare in Europe, from which I have received important help in relation to my constituents. I am sure others have too. The real problem is the regulation of fraudulent behaviour and making sure that people in particularly vulnerable situations are adequately protected against it. The risk of sectoral legislation about one particular kind of fraud is that you simply regulate one part and leave on the margins new forms of fraud, which is unregulated or left under only general criminal law regulation. It will be important for the Commission to study that carefully and bring forward stronger proposals to us. It is a matter of real concern to all our citizens that this should be done properly. We call upon the Commission now to follow up the excellent report of my friend and colleague, Mr Medina Ortega.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, I hope that the House will not accept this request for urgency. I was rapporteur for the legal basis issue when this report originally came before the committee and this House. At that time it was proposed to create a common market organisation for ethyl alcohol alone. In committee that was amended to cover synthetic as well as agriculturally originating ethyl alcohol. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, after studying it carefully, came to the view and reported back that there was no satisfactory legal basis that could be devised for that proposal. On that account the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development proposed to this House, and the proposal was accepted, that the project be withdrawn for reconsideration by the Commission. Instead there was very quick reconsideration, and a substantial change. The Legal Affairs Committee, having had a look at it last week, concluded that the same objection concerning the legal basis applies because there is still an attempt, under Article 37, to bring together agricultural and synthetic ethyl alcohol. This is unsatisfactory. Where a serious question has been raised about the legal basis, the committee responsible, upon considering a new solution to the problem, should surely once again ask for the legal basis issue to be properly looked at, not rush it through under urgent procedure.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, on a point of order, the matter came before the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market earlier this year. Against my own advice the Legal Affairs Committee held that further and clearer information was required and a letter was sent requesting such information, to which I understand no reply has yet been received. However, about a couple of weeks ago I raised this at the coordinators' meeting of the Legal Affairs Committee, saying that I hoped that a further inquiry might be made in order to clarify this matter one way or the other, as we ought, as speedily as we reasonably can. Mr President, a little while ago you very vigorously wrote to Air France protesting at conditions in which people travel to this Parliament. You received a very emollient reply from Air France assuring you that no such untoward thing would occur ever again. I should like to report to Members of the House, who I am sure will feel an agony of sympathy for me, that today, for the second successive occasion, on turning up at Edinburgh Airport in good time for my check-in for the Air France flight from Edinburgh to Paris to catch the Strasbourg plane, I was told the plane was overbooked and I should re-route myself via Brussels in order to arrive here for 5 o'clock. This is a pretty poor show and I have written a letter drawing attention to this shabby state of affairs – which will, no doubt, not receive as emollient a reply as yours did. I am sorry because I had hoped to raise a point about the agenda, which we have now adopted. Perhaps I will have a chance tomorrow morning.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
),  
rapporteur
. – Mr President, I am greatly relieved as rapporteur in this case to finally have the opportunity of presenting this report before the House, whether it be rejected or accepted in the end. I have been a Member of the House for just under three years and for nearly all that time I have been honoured to be one of the rapporteurs on parliamentary privilege and immunity for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. One of the earliest tasks assigned to me was a bundle of requests from Members from Italy, or from their lawyers, concerning their concern that prosecutions or other legal actions were taking place in Italy which violated their immunity. Our Rules of Procedure which will I hope be amended in the light of the Duff report make elaborate provision for the steps Parliament should take in order to decide whether or not to waive immunity on receipt of a request from the proper authorities of the Member State. The problem in the Italian cases was that no request had been received other than from the Members themselves and this gave rise to concern. If it were the case that privileges or immunities enjoyed by Members of this House were being ignored by a Member State that would be a serious matter. The point that I would make, and the Duff report makes here, is that the privileges and immunities of this House exist not to expand the rights of Members as citizens beyond those of other citizens. They exist solely to protect the dignity of this assembly as a European legislature and to protect the conditions of effective and free democratic debate in it. If it were case that Members could show that their position as Members of this House, as legislators on the European scene, was being prejudiced by conduct of a Member State and there was no way to bring this before the House solely because no appropriate authority in a Member State had sought to have the immunity waived, this would in itself be clearly an unsatisfactory state of affairs. The House possesses immunity under two different provisions. Under Article 9 of the Protocol of 1965, Members enjoy immunity from any form of enquiry, detention or legal proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in the performance of their duties. There are other immunities which arise in other circumstances where the immunity a Member enjoys is equivalent to that of a Member of a Member State parliament in their own Member State and in other Member States, an immunity from prosecution except with the agreement of Parliament. After a great deal of study, it became clear that what was at issue in all the cases before us was only an issue concerning Article 9 of the Protocol. It was the issue of whether prosecutions taken against Members for opinions they were expressing or had expressed violated the immunity they enjoy under Article 9. Our Rules of Procedure are silent on what we should do in that case. It seems to me that as a democratic legislative assembly, we must have some inherent power to draw it to the attention of Member States if the conditions of free debate are being violated in this House. Taking that view of the matter, the Committee looked over the cases and in all respects save one accepted the recommendations which I was minded to put forward. Looking at the cases as clearly and candidly as possible, it seems to me that Mr Speroni's was one where because matters were asked concerning an explanation of votes in the House he was clearly being called to account for an opinion expressed in the exercise of his functions. Mr Marra's case was one in which documents published by Mr Marra is his capacity as a Member had, in a complex way, given rise to prosecutions or judicial allegations. These seem to be clear cases where Article 9 was in issue. The Committee thought, but I do not think, that Mr Dell'Utri's case was the same. The reason why I differed from the Committee is that in Mr Dell'Utri's case, the statements made, whatever their truth and whatever their legal character, were made several years before Mr Dell'Utri became a Member of the House. I cannot see any sensible reading of a provision concerning opinions expressed or votes cast by us in the performance of our duties which relates to statements we make before we become Members. You cannot equate a candidate for office with a holder of office. This goes for ourselves in our capacities as candidates, by the way. I therefore recommend to the House that we take the action suggested in my report and that we draw these cases to the attention of the Italian authorities. My own Parliamentary group has moved an amendment to take the name of Mr Dell'Utri out of the report and I personally believe that it is the right course to take. I hope I have given an account to colleagues of why I think it is right course to take and that it is simply a matter of an objective and fair-minded reading of the Protocol rather than an attempt to engage in a political judgement either way about the state of affairs in the Italian Republic.

 – Mr President, on 10 April we debated the González Álvarez report on ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin. I was the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in relation to that report. It was withdrawn on 10 April because of an agreement that there was no adequate legal basis for the measure as it then stood. By way of an emergency, it was rushed through the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development yesterday in a new form without any reference back to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. That is an irregular way of proceeding and I request that Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market be asked, even it is asked to do it quickly, to verify that a legal base exists for this measure in its new form. While I am on my feet on the issue of Rule 63, a lot of the issues under the common fisheries policy reform raise profound issues of legal base, and hopefully that will thoroughly considered in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market as well as the Committee on Fisheries.

 – Mr President, Amendment No 1 in the English texts opens with the phrase 'Considers that there is a continuing democratic deficit in the European Union', and goes on to say that, 'we should democratise the institutions therefore...'. In some language versions, the English word 'continuing' has been translated as 'permanent' which, for example in Spanish, gave rise to some distress. English is the original text. Could the translation services please get it right in the other languages.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, I hope I am not too late. I asked in a note for an oral amendment to insert the word "by", so that it would read "or by the Committee of the Regions", and that would make a considerable difference.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, like others I take it to be a great privilege to participate in this debate – late in the day, though it is. My own group has two particular points that we would like to ask colleagues to build into the report before it finally sees the light of day. Firstly, just an allusion to the significance of the democratic deficit and the need, finally, fully to democratise the institutions of the Union. As long as we do not call it a "permanent" democratic deficit, I am sure that the PPE-DE Group will be with us on that, and I hope that will be written in. Further, we suggest – and colleagues on the left are very much in agreement with this – that a little more emphasis on the social, as well as the economic and political element – should be written in. Apart from that, we are really very happy with the way this is going forward and look forward to voting for it tomorrow. The key point Mr Lamassoure makes – and has made throughout – is that the issue is not one of needing to rewrite a new list of competences for the institutions but a need to draw to citizens' attention to the fact that there is already a very adequate statement of the different kinds of competences – the Union's own competences and the shared ones – and the fact that the principle of residuarity governs the rest. The states are responsible for what is not given to the Union. All that is clear in principle, but it could do with being stated more clearly in practice so that citizens are better aware of it. That is a very important point. In that context, we raise the issue of subsidiarity. Where competences are shared, it is important indeed that in all those areas where local knowledge ought to prevail, local knowledge does prevail. That is to say, that decisions are taken at the most appropriate level for them. Recital G makes a very important contribution to expanding and giving greater bite to the idea of subsidiarity, and that is also to be very greatly welcomed. We in our group believe much in extended subsidiarity. Subsidiarity does not stop at the front door of the Member States: it goes right down to the territorial entities within the Member States, to the local authorities within the Member States, and that is of critical importance to us all. We, along with the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Liberals, would like a little more strength to it, but we do not mind. This report as it stands now represents a huge step forward in the thinking of Europeans and of this Parliament. I repeat, it is a huge privilege to take part in this debate and in particular – and I say it in his presence – it is a privilege to have taken part in a debate led by Mr Lamassoure, who has done such an extraordinary job of setting up the architecture but being willing to adjust the sculpture, to borrow a metaphor of his own this morning. He has done a fantastic job, we are all greatly in his debt, and I hope my group will vote unanimously with him tomorrow. (Applause)

 – Mr President, my task is the ordinarily rather boring one of reporting that the Legal Affairs Committee considered this matter and found it not to be wanting. In fact, here we have a proposal under Article 37 which is fully justified as a common agricultural policy issue, and, therefore, the procedures are appropriate. Of course, it is important that we should check that there is an adequate legal base. We are now discussing in the Convention and elsewhere, the question of holding the Community organs to their proper competences and I am delighted that this regulation passes muster in that respect. It is also, as Mr Kindermann has said, a good thing to take this complex body of law and consolidate it into a single regulation that will give us a community of approach throughout the Community. I am not sure if I would have felt that I was justified in taking up the time of the House, had that been all that there was to the matter, but I want to add to the point we are discussing today. The importation of animal products for human consumption is intimately connected, as Mrs Lucas has just said, with the disastrous outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease that we suffered in the United Kingdom. In my own constituency, Dumfries and Galloway, we were as you know particularly afflicted in that case. If we were to move more and more strongly towards local production for local consumption, just as Mrs Lucas said a moment ago, we would avoid some of these dangers. It is vitally important that, in introducing these very necessary laws, we are careful to ensure that we do not create circumstances which themselves increase the pressure for excessive animal movement. I hope that will be taken into account. If I have strayed beyond the limits of the Legal Affairs Committee, at least I have not strayed beyond my time.

I have previously stated in this House how vital the Channel Tunnel link is to industry in Scotland and to the viability of Eurocentral at Motherwell as the northernmost end of a trans-European network. We must get the tunnel open again as a matter of urgency. This resolution could be even stronger but I give it my hearty backing. ***

. – Mr President, we have reached that time of the evening at which I am sure Commissioner Bolkestein, Mrs Ayuso González, you and I can all think of better things to do with ethyl alcohol than talk about it. However, we are fated to spend at least a few more minutes in conversation. I would like to express profound sympathy with Mrs Ayuso González for the amount of work and time she has put into this report, only to discover that it was not possible to construct an adequate legal base to bring in both the sources of ethyl alcohol. As I understand it, ethyl alcohol produced for industrial use comes more or less equally from agricultural sources and from non-agricultural sources, chiefly from the oil industry. In that context, it would be necessary to find a dual legal base to deal with both together. Personally I think she is right that it would be absurd for the Community to try to deal with this single identical substance differently according to the two alternative sources. On the other hand, the economics of production and the industrial circumstances of production are quite different, as I am sure Commissioner Bolkestein knows even better than I from his own manifold past experience. So it is quite an important question to try and find a way of dealing with the whole market in a way that is sensitive to both sources of production. It would have been objectionable – I know from contacts of my own with the oil industry in Scotland – to spatchcock the oil industry-produced ethanol into an agricultural organisation which had been set up without regard to circumstances in the other sector, so we need a two-handed approach to this. Thus it is absolutely right to suggest that the Commission should put its thinking cap on again and come back with a new look at whatever is needed in the way of keeping an eye on the whole alcohol market at this difficult time, dealing even-handedly with both sources of production.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, like everybody else here, I enormously appreciate the work which Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi did as rapporteur, partly because we appreciated so much her work as chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. I agree very much with the three points she wanted us to focus on, although on one I take a different view. We are all agreed about the importance of preserving a role for national offices. On the second point about jurisdiction, it seems to many of us to have been a part of the genius of the development of the European Community that justice was largely decentralised and that the role of the Community courts in matters particularly of private law and commercial law was an advisory or secondary role, with the main jurisdictions being localised. That is a vitally important principle to keep – if it can be done without destroying the patent regime. As Mr Lehne said, there are wrong roads that we could go down that would end up with a dispersal of Community jurisdictions and parallel jurisdictions between the national systems and the Community system. That would be a great pity. So I hope that the jurisdictional proposals will be accepted. Then there is the language regime, a question on which I differ, with great respect for Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, and so does my group. We believe that sustaining the existing system inside the European Patent Office is important. On the other hand, we also believe that people should be able to put forward a patent claim in their own language. We then believe that it should be translated into all the other languages – not the whole process but just, as it says in Amendment No 20(c), "issued in the language of submission and in the official language in which the procedure has been carried out, accompanied by translation of the patent claims and of a short abstract in the other official languages of the Community", and then paragraph (d), "translations shall be performed by the Translation Centre for the bodies of the European Union and costs borne by the European Union". Preserving the principle of linguistic equality is an important public good of the European Union. The Union should pay for that. It should not become a cost to patent holders. Therefore the objections about over-pricing the European patent would not apply.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, I would also like to thank Mr Deprez, and indeed the Belgian State, for this excellent report and excellent initiative. It is true that the scourge of violence, often organised violence, has plagued international sport, particularly international football, for too long. We wholeheartedly support initiatives that are aimed at increasing cooperation between authorities in different Member States. They are a vital tool in the battle to keep sport clean and to keep it as it should be. We like you to consider one small, but important, textual amendment. The proposed decision is flawed in one respect: it appears to assume that each Member State is represented by just one single national team. This is not so, as you well know. My own country, for example, is represented by an independent Scotland team, despite the fact that Scotland is, for the time being anyway, not an independent Member State. We have a long footballing pedigree and indeed the first international football match ever played was the game between Scotland and England in 1872. Scottish supporters – the so-called 'Tartan Army' which is tartan, but not an army – have for quite a few years now had an unparalleled reputation for good behaviour and good humour. It is for this reason that I and my EFA colleagues have tabled three amendments to the Council text. They will not change the substance but they will give recognition to the distinctive footballing and indeed legal histories of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England. Do not speak about the national team, but about national teams
. I see Mr Deprez accepts the point and I am most grateful to him for that.

The Barcelona Council, despite the big talk by Tony Blair before it, was disappointing and timid. The Council promised in the past to put sustainability in the forefront of European Development. This Summit has paid no more than lip-service to this commitment. The so-called 'liberalization' favoured by Blair's right wing caucus has hit the rock of French immoveability in relation to energy production in the domestic sector, so it remains the case that Electricité de France
 can take over companies outside France while protected from converse interventions. The rhetoric of liberalisation too frequently cloaks policies toward the single market that are dancing to the tune of monopolistically inclined interests of vast corporations. Adam Smith's vision of a free economy unhampered by interventions of massive aggregations of capital is far from the reality that we see in the contemporary globalised economy. In relation to Gibraltar, no one can fail to welcome progress between Spain and the United Kingdom. But there is no reference to the people of Gibraltar. What has become of self-determination?
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, I apologise for taking up your time. You are aware, as I am, of a campaign waged by the Daily Record 
newspaper in Scotland, in the course of which some extremely unfair things were said about our colleague Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, whose valuable report we adopted today – things which I deplore. It is the case, however, that this valuable report, which protects working people against noise in the workplace could have had unintended side effects on the music industry. I am very glad that Amendments Nos 23 and 25 were corrected, thereby saving the world of pipe bands amongst others. I think I am the only piper in this House, so I am particularly pleased about that! But I do want to say to Mrs Thorning-Schmidt that her Scottish colleagues regret the way she was unfairly pilloried in our press.

 – Mr President, Members of the House need no telling how useful to us the publication Recent and Forthcoming Work in Committee
 is. It gives us a way to plan forward. A week ago I was asked by a colleague who works as an advisor to the Scottish Parliament if there was anyway I could help her with the problem of foreseeing business coming forward in the European Parliament in order that committees of that other parliament should be aware of our work and able to plan in relation to it. I said that there was a marvellous publication and I would get it for her. My staff asked for it in Parliament this week and I asked the Parliament office in Edinburgh if they could provide it. I was informed that this is a rare work of which Members of Parliament get one copy each and which may not be copied for anyone else, and no further copies can be obtained. In these days of transparency in the conduct of our business, it seems to me that is a provision which ought to be re-examined. This very useful publication should be made widely available. A second point: Yesterday, we approved minutes which drew attention to Mrs Doyle's statement of Thursday, 7 February, that in respect of the Watson report the PPE-ED Group by mistake failed to vote in favour of the habeas corpus 
amendment. Had they not made that mistake because of a late change in numbering, that amendment would have been carried in Parliament. This is a momentous fact which I hope will be drawn to the attention of Commissioner Vitorino, the President-in-Office of the Council and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi as chair of the relevant committee of this House.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
) 
 rapporteur
. – Mr President. In these cases which are before us, there are very serious allegations levied against two Members of Parliament, which are stated on the first page of the explanatory statement of my report, which I recommend to Members to take a look at. The procedures were commenced in July 2000, concerning illegal arms trading, influence peddling, misuse of corporate funds, breach of trust and receiving stolen goods. This concerned the sale of arms to several African countries in breach of French law on arms trading by companies through which countless transfers and even cash payments were made to a string of different people. There is a charge against Mr Pasqua, but not against Mr Marchiani, which concerns illegal funding of an election campaign through acceptance of donations and funding of the European election campaign in breach of the provisions of Article L52.8 of the Electoral Code. These being the charges, the first charge concerning illegal arms trading, etc., against both Mr Pasqua and Mr Marchiani, the second against Mr Pasqua only, the examining magistrates are requesting the waiver of parliamentary immunity of these two gentlemen, so that certain judicial supervision measures may be taken against them. The Members would be forbidden to enter into contact with certain witnesses, or co-accused, or to visit certain countries and they may be required to put up bail. This notification order was forwarded first to the public prosecutor of the Republic at the level of the Court of First Instance, then through the public prosecutor at the Paris Court of Appeal and then from that public prosecutor to the Minister of Justice and by the Minister of Justice to the Parliament here. It should be noted, at the First Instance, that the public prosecutor of the Republic firmly supports a request for judicial supervision by the examining magistrates, stressing the gravity and nature of the case and describing it as necessary in principle. However, the public prosecutor at the Court of Appeal considered that, and I quote, "contrary to the view expressed by the other prosecutor, the present request for waiver of immunity gives grounds for reservations". On the one hand, the request for judicial supervision does not stipulate what countries the accused would be forbidden to visit and on the other, following a ruling by the Cour de Cassation
, the scope of the proceedings finally to be pursued is still to be determined by the relevant Court of Appeal. The Minister of Justice, however, forwarded the request for waiver of immunity, together with the forwarding letters from the public prosecutor at First Instance and at the Court of Appeal, without attaching any further remarks. This is the situation in which we have to take a decision. I want to say, first of all, that the crimes of which these Members are charged are serious ones. We have an absolute rule that we form no opinion either way about the merits of the charges but that the Members enjoy the presumption of innocence. The public prosecutor in France is entitled to pursue his duties under law and Parliament takes no side on that issue. They are serious crimes and of a kind that would not ordinarily attract parliamentary immunity because they do not relate to the ordinary and proper activities of a Member of this Parliament, or a politician operating in a democratic society. It does make it important that I should acknowledge that both Members strenuously affirm their innocence and denounce what they consider to have been abusive elements in the prosecution process. However, in the nature of the case, I can have no view and Parliament should take no view about these points. The present request for waiver of immunity, therefore, does not concern the issue whether these prosecutions may or should continue in accordance with French law. Under Article 10 of the Protocol of 1965, there is no relevant immunity, either for a deputy of the French National Assembly or, therefore, for a French MEP in the face of prosecution on charges of this kind. The issue of immunity and the request for waiver relates only to the issue of whether the Court may issue binding orders restricting the MEPs' freedom of movement, or their freedom in making contact with other persons. I would draw to the attention of all colleagues that if there are freedoms which are vitally important to the exercise of public representative office, especially in a Parliament of this kind, freedom to communicate with other citizens and the citizens of other countries, and freedom to move as one chooses, is critically important, as part of doing the job. In its present form, the request for waiver of immunity seems unacceptably precise and indeed the documents of the case seem to indicate that no attention has been paid to the recommendation for the request of waiver to be taken forward only on the basis of a more specific statement, concerning places and persons involved. There is one other aspect of the case which, I regret to say, gives rise to a suspicion that regard for the conditions of free parliamentary debate has not sufficiently animated the prosecution, and that is the fact, which was disclosed in the course of this, that the prosecutor at one point asked our President, your predecessor, for details of the voting records of these two Members in order that the possibility of their having exercised improper influence could be pursued further. Article 9 of the Protocol, as President Fontaine sharply reminded the prosecutor, makes us entirely free from any legal proceeding whatever in any expression of opinion of vote cast in performance of our duties as Members of this Parliament. In these circumstances, the Legal Affairs Committee, and I wholly endorsed its view, proposes that the request received from the French Minister of Justice for waiver of immunity ought to be rejected in the form in which it has been presented to the Parliament. I hope that decision, together with the explanatory statement, will be forwarded, if it is adopted by the Parliament. This may not be the end of this matter but, in the form we received it, this request for waiver of immunity was in the view of the Legal Affairs Committee unacceptable, and I commend that view to the House.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, I would like to inform the House that at the end of the debate yesterday afternoon, Mr Napolitano, in response to statements made during the debate by myself and others, made the following offer: he suggested that we ought to withdraw Amendments Nos 18 and 12 in order that he might, through the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, propose the bringing forward of a specific report on the issue of constitutional regions in the architecture of Europe. Many of us believe that is a very important question. Those who think it is important are divided at the moment between those who would wish to include it in this report and those who would wish to deal with it in another context. The best course – and my group agrees with this as I believe the Liberals do as well – will be for us to accept Mr Napolitano's generous proposition that this should be raised as a separate topic in its own right through the Constitutional Affairs Committee and that we should withdraw these amendments. I therefore propose that be done. (Applause)
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, I am content with that, but they are on different points. The other two amendments make this observation: there are exactly 15 Member States in the Union at the moment and that is not disputed. Whether there are more nations is a different question. However, in a spirit of goodwill I withdraw these amendments as well.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, I follow Mrs Attwooll as one of the other Members for Scotland in this House. I am very grateful to Mr Watson and to the Liberal colleagues who put forward the questions which promote this debate today. It is a vital debate. To try and make the point Mrs Attwooll was making yet more vivid, 30 miles away from the house in which I live in Edinburgh, midway between Edinburgh and Glasgow, at the town of Motherwell, lies the most northerly freight outpost of the trans-European network into the United Kingdom, the Motherwell Eurocentral depot. We have been told in recent weeks that the carrier out of that port, EWS, will not be able to afford to continue providing a service out of Scotland at the current available number of trains per day. It would be a crisis for Scotland, and therefore a crisis for transport across the Union, if that happened. It is well known, for example, that the Scotch whisky industry depends heavily on rail freight to get malt scotch and blended scotch into the European market. Heavy losses are being made on a vitally important trade. In these circumstances it is encouraging to be told that the Commission takes this matter seriously, but it is not encouraging to be told that all will be well by June, because the information we are receiving from the commercial parties involved is that they cannot last until June at present levels. This is a time when people throughout the European Union people are asking themselves the question: Do we obtain the benefits which we are promised from our membership of the European Union? These benefits particularly relate to the opportunity to trade freely across the Union. Other benefits which have been promised are those arising from intermodal transport – that not everything should go on the roads. That affects not just people in Scotland; it even more affects people down the motorway routes through England, if far too much heavy freight traffic goes down there. We need traffic on the railways. We also need traffic by sea. We are very grateful to Commissioner de Palacio for the work she has put into securing the new ferry link between Scotland and Zeebrugge, but if we are going to have a sensible transport policy which really does spread the load and save the roads from excessive use by heavy traffic, we must have this railway line kept open. I am grateful to colleagues who have raised this question. I am grateful to the Commission for taking it seriously; but I want to know as well what compensation will be available to ensure that those who have lost money are not prevented from trading altogether by the uneconomic conditions now prevailing on this route.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, all of us in this House are agreed that it is a good thing to move towards the creation of a common European judicial space. We are also agreed, particularly in respect of the arrest warrant, that it makes the adoption of common and high minimum standards a matter of urgency. Mr Watson and Mrs Terrón i Cusí have asked us today to take it on trust that it will be done as a matter of urgency. We have to take some things on trust, but I would be reluctant to take all on trust. Furthermore, standards alone are never enough because standards can be broken. The only thing that guarantees high standards being observed is effective remedies. One of the most effective remedies ever devised was devised by the English common lawyers – I speak as a Scotsman – in the way of making sure that those who are wrongly detained are brought to court and released if the jailer cannot show cause for keeping them there. That is a really effective remedy. In adopting the European arrest warrant each of our states makes its own judiciary the instrument of justice in another state. That is a good thing, that we help each other. But it should also be the case that if the powers of one country's courts are abused by misconduct of prosecutors in another country, they can be recalled with an effective remedy. An effective remedy must be a Europe-wide remedy and one that diminishes the risk of undue detention pre-trial like the old 110-day rule which we celebrate in my country. Let us have Amendment No 4 and make sure that we have remedies that are effective as well as standards that are high.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, when we are reflecting on the problems of improving procedures in the House it is worth noticing that an explanation of vote of this kind is one way one can reply to a point taken by the Commissioner at the end of a debate. At the end of the debate on the Watson report, Mr Vitorino said that the amendment relating to the habeas corpus
 order would risk confusing the issue and undermine respect for human rights. In that he completely ignored the point that the first condition stated for the operation of that amendment was for there to be a violation of human rights in the receiving state. The point I made in my speech in the debate was that it is not enough to have common agreement to respect rights; you must have effective remedies. That text of ours would have put in an effective remedy. Since Parliament in its wisdom (or unwisdom) chose not to adopt it, I voted against the Watson report on the Arrest Warrant. Other Members from the United Kingdom will come to regret that they did not too. Some of my colleagues in the European Free Alliance – a majority of them – voted for the Watson report; not that they did not also regret the absence of the habeas corpus
 amendment, but that they felt a strong commitment in conscience, as we all do, to getting the European judicial space going forward, and thought that necessary.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
),  
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market
. – Mr President, I should like to say, as draftsperson of an opinion, what a very great pleasure it has been to work alongside such a distinguished parliamentarian as Mr Napolitano, the author of this excellent report. There are few differences between the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and his report. In particular we want to endorse firmly the point in his conclusion that the so-called second chamber of the European legislature would be an unworkable third chamber and we are very glad that the suggestion has been so carefully refuted from inside one of the countries from which it emerged, namely the United Kingdom. On the report itself, the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs were largely adopted by the rapporteur in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. Our paragraph 1, dealing with collaboration among the parliaments of the Union, is well covered in his paragraph 10; our paragraph 2, on the importance of participation of representatives of the European Parliament and national parliaments in the future Convention, has been adopted by Mr Napolitano. This is very important because it speaks of the need for vigorous debate in the Convention to see whether we can produce a consensus. Some rumours emanating from the direction of Mr Giscard d'Estaing suggest that his idea is that there need not be a debate because all will be clear from the presidency. If that is so, we must disabuse him of that notion. This has to be a Convention that will debate. In paragraph 4, that reappears as paragraph 12 in the Napolitano report. Finally, the one point of difference between the Committee on Legal Affairs and Mr Napolitano was whether there ought to be articulate and express mention of the role of regional parliaments with legislative power in this report. I think strongly there ought to be. The Committee on Legal Affairs voted for it clearly and my own group has tabled some amendments. Mr Napolitano said to me privately that he thinks this could be taken up on a different occasion through the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. If he were able to make an assurance to that effect tomorrow, it might be possible for us to reconsider things. I shall speak to him privately about that. It would be good if we could go forward with maximum agreement. I ask, in the mean time, that Parliament concentrate on this paragraph 3 and the parallel amendments tabled by myself and colleagues.

 – Mr President, I should like to take up a point Mrs McKenna raised yesterday concerning electronic voting and the secret ballot. It is unhappily the case that the secret ballot arrangement by electronic voting is imperfect at the moment. It is imperfect because, even when one uses the device mentioned by Mrs Jackson yesterday of a paper to cover the screen, it is easy for one's colleagues behind and beside to see how one voted. When a secret ballot is important, Members should be protected from peer-group pressure. I would therefore like you to refer to the Bureau the question of whether the electronic voting system can be improved in order to really function as a secret ballot and protect Members from those pressures from which they ought to be protected.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, it is a happy coincidence that you have taken the chair this afternoon for it permits me to say with what pride it is that I share with you a constituency under our present electoral arrangements as a fellow Member for Scotland. You have brought credit on our constituency in the dignified and splendid way you have conducted yourself over recent weeks and we are very pleased with that. (Applause)
 In that constituency, as you well know, it is not taken for granted that what is publicly provided or done is bad and only what is privately done is good. Nor does the Commission take that view. But, as Mrs Wallis has just said, this debate focuses on the very question of what decisions are properly taken by the public authorities, by democratic procedures on the basis of public choice, and what must then reasonably be left to the market to deal with. It is crucial for that dividing line to be got right. Mrs Hautala asked a question which the Commissioner must answer when replying to this debate today. It is a question which can also be addressed to Mr Zappalà, who says that we should only take economic conditions into account, not, for example, environmental or social ones. If Helsinki or Edinburgh became seriously polluted with diesel fumes, that would give rise to costs. Somebody would have to pay to clean them up eventually. To say that is a non-economic cost is simply an odd kind of economics. So we turn the thing round: we ask who shall decide if the streets of Helsinki or the streets of Edinburgh need environmentally friendly and sustainable buses? Who can best take that decision? Is it best taken in Brussels? Is it best taken in Strasbourg by this Parliament? Is it best taken in London? No, it is best taken in Edinburgh or in Helsinki. We need a decision of that kind to be taken locally. Of course, we do not want that decision to lead to unfair consequences. It must be open and transparent. Who can come and bid for this contract and on what terms can they obtain it? That is fine, but do not exclude the local authority, the people of a region, from saying themselves what standards they demand of those who serve them. If that is to be ruled out by European law, Europe will not grow in popularity among its citizens. We must have this kind of clear responsibility for the public good taken by public authorities. I would like to hear the Commission's reply to that point.

 – I wonder whether I might say with real sincerity what a pleasure it is to take part in Question Time when Mrs Neyts is with us because she really does make an effort to answer the question fully and faithfully. That is genuinely appreciated. I hope you will pass this message to your Prime Minister and try to ensure, when the Council meets next week, that it really does address itself to the issue of democracy in Europe. We face a crisis of democracy in the Union and it will become in some ways yet more acute as the Union enlarges. If people in the regions and localities of Europe feel that their democracy means nothing, because all decisions are taken in remote places; if they are always merely told 'look to the constitution of your Member State if you are not happy with things', that will damage democracy in Europe, not help it. I therefore ask you most sincerely to try to ensure that the type of issue which my colleagues and I have been putting to you this evening is really thought about at Laeken.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, the Union already has implicitly in the Treaties the bones of a Constitution. We all look to the Convention to make it explicit and clear and to create the proper legal framework for a thoroughly democratic Europe. That, of course, will involve, as has been said in parts of this debate, fully recognising the prerogatives and powers of this great all-European Parliamentary Assembly. But democracy at this level will not be effective unless it is also fully effective at the level of the little battalions: at the level of the local authorities, at the level of the constitutional regions, the self-governing internal nations of the Member States. Now that means that the Convention must look to that question as well, and improving governance in Europe must, as the Commission has said, look closely at the proper involvement of regional and local authorities. I thought that the Commission was somewhat timid in what they said about that, but alas, Parliament argues yet further timidity and talks down all the references in the White Paper to regional involvement with the Commission. Recital M and Paragraph 26 are to be deeply regretted as currently phrased in Mrs Kaufmann's otherwise admirable report. We want to see these amended. We want to see a strengthening of the reference to the necessary involvement of the Commission and Parliament with the regional and local authorities, as well as with national parliaments. We do not want to subvert the constitutional framework of Europe. We want to improve it.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE

 – Madam President, a number of colleagues have remarked that it is a very bad thing to have so many votes on these occasions, but I would like to congratulate you on having kept us going. I do not know for what purpose my constituents elected me if it was not to exercise discretion and choice in deciding what things to vote about. I do not think we do a more important thing than cast our votes for and against proposals in this House and objecting to that is a very foolish thing. Moreover, if one looks at the votes cast today, there were very few foregone conclusions: there were close votes on all the roll-call votes and that seems to me to show the need to test these matters by voting. The idea that we should have fewer votes seems absurd. That said, I should like to make a remark about the Watson report. Once we have got to the point of having Community law, if that law is defied it seems perfectly obvious that there have to be within our nation States – and nations which are not States – criminal rules which uphold it, otherwise the States pass laws which they are not able to enforce and the Community becomes a laughing stock. Of course, that requires a proper safeguard and proper defence rights. These days we are thinking about defending our civilisation. Our civilisation is to do with giving people proper rights of defence and I am sad at recent developments in the United Kingdom that seem to be ending these rights.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – I am grateful for the President-in-Office of the Council's last remarks. I belong to a national movement in my own country, Scotland, which over the last 100 years has produced great constitutional change without a single drop of human blood being shed or a single act of violence occurring. There are other places, as she knows, where similar constitutional changes have taken place and are continuing. The Council and the President-in-Office of the Council are perhaps wilfully missing the point in Mr Nogueira Román's question. It is a great mistake to say that there are some ends that tend to attract terrorism and therefore to attack those ends in themselves. The truth is that a terrorist is someone who thinks that an end justifies any means. It is absurd to believe that if the end is noble any means can be justified. Those who believe that, make whatever end they seek ignoble. I wish the Council would be less selective in its attitude to such questions.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, there was a time when Europeans travelled all over the universities of Europe and studied what was still a common law based on the Roman law. Indeed, in my own country, Scotland, that lasted until the 17th century, during which 6000 members of the Faculty of Advocates of Scotland at various times studied in the universities of Utrecht and Leiden. That kind of interaction of lawyers is one of the things which contributed most to our civilisation and from which our legal civilisation has grown. So this is a very good project and the time-tabling suggested by Mr Lehne and the Commission is feasible and worthwhile. Nevertheless, as Mrs Wallis has said, legal traditions are valued objects. People concern themselves greatly about the coherence and integrity of a legal order. Therefore it must be with great sensitivity that we move forward in bringing back together again legal systems and legal traditions through the kinds of common definition that Mr Lehne is suggesting. With that in mind, I have one doubt and it involves a difference with what Mr Medina Ortega has just said. Clause 14 of the report suggests that a regulation is really the best way to take this forward. The difficulty relates to subsidiarity. If these things are to be done well, common definitions will have to be sensitively adapted and grafted into what are very deep and organic legal traditions. You cannot do that by thrusting a regulation down the throats of the legal community. We in the United Kingdom have two legal systems, rather distinct, and it is going to be absolutely vital for this development that both are adequately and properly represented in further discussions, as they have been on bodies like the Lando Commission in the past.
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – May I frame a question which I hope the Commission will feel free to answer simply yes or no. Wittgenstein told us that to choose a language is to choose a form of life. I think, therefore, that if we lose languages we lose forms of life. Does the Commissioner agree with me that it would be a tragedy for Europe if it loses languages such as Scots Gaelic, and Lowland Scots through neglect and that the lesser-used languages deserve greater encouragement than they get now?
MacCormick (Verts/ALE
). 
 – The Commission will no doubt have realised, from the shared language of these three questions, that they originate outside this House, and indeed Amnesty International has been pressing us on this point. I need not underline the significance and weight that attaches to representations by Amnesty International. I am very grateful indeed to the Commissioner for his assurance in response to the third part of the question about the steps that are being taken to try to bring this matter under reasonable control. It is a kind of irony, is it not, that the original idea of the CE marking was to give assurances about safety. Well, if I am at the wrong end of a safe piece of torture equipment, it is not a good place to be. Can you give us any indication of a timetable for the progress you hope to make on this?
