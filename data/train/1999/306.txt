 Mr President, my group strongly endorses the critical positions set out in the Belder report. There is an unacceptable situation in Chechnya, where the Russian army is engaged in gross violations of human rights. There are disturbing internal political changes within Russia, with what is termed ‘managed democracy’ increasingly taking on authoritarian characteristics, and we also take a highly critical line on Russia’s dealings with the new Member States of the European Union. The European Union formerly adopted a two-track strategy in its dealings with Russia; underlying it was the fact that Russia is – and must be – one of our most important strategic partners. A two-track strategy does not of course mean that we refrain from criticism – on the contrary; it is when strategic relationships are being developed that there has to be a central role for engagement with our canon of values, for the upholding of democracy, of the standards associated with the rule of law, and of human rights. At the same time, though, it was also our concern to achieve the sustainable mutual interconnection of Russia and the European Union, and not only by means of the partnership and cooperation agreement. I think this would not be the moment to put question marks against this strategy; in so doing, we would be letting go of the opportunities we have for really getting to grips with internal political developments or with the situation in Chechnya. Moreover, I believe, we ought to be far more serious about concerning ourselves with social conditions in Russia. The life expectancy of men in Russia has decreased by ten years over the past twelve years – a tragic development, and one that characterises the situation in many parts of that country. Although I endorse Mr Belder’s criticisms of Russian policy, I would have liked the report to have made more explicit what he said in his speech just now, with his trenchant criticism of the Council’s actions and of the European governments whose dealings with Russia are based on economic rather than strategic considerations. Ever since 11 September, many governments – and not only Mr Berlusconi’s, but also the German Federal Government – have been allowing the war in Chechnya to be trivialised as part of the war on terrorism, and so we keep quiet about it. I do not think it is enough to think of Russia as a strategic partner only in the economic sense or in terms of securing our borders and preventing trafficking in human beings. Our relations with Russia have to be characterised by mutuality and interpenetration.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if you have ever visited Afghanistan or endeavoured to become more deeply informed about it, you will know how appalling and how extensive is the damage that has been done there – materially, culturally, socially and in human terms. Civil wars, the power struggles of local warlords, the Soviet war of occupation, the Taliban dictatorship, and the Northern Alliance’s bombardments too have killed and maimed millions, destroyed the economy of what was already an extremely poor country and left much of its society in ruins. For centuries, Afghanistan was the plaything of foreign powers’ strategic interests. In my view, the present situation is above all the consequence of the wars sparked off by the Soviet invasion, and of the USA’s short-sighted policies, both of which gave the Taliban real military and political power in Afghanistan. The victims have always been Afghan women, children and men – in their millions. This report, however, is not meant to be about our differences on the past – although we certainly have them – but about our common position that the international community must take responsibility for providing, on a massive scale, political, financial and economic support for the people of Afghanistan in shaping a peaceful, democratic and social future for themselves. This aid, and the financial support provided by the Commission in particular, must not be cut back; it must be stepped up to take account of the prevailing conditions. It would be irresponsible of the international community, in the shadow of the war in Iraq and of the tragic difficulties there, to backtrack on its commitment to Afghanistan and weaken its solidarity with its people. I believe that it is precisely because of the situation in Iraq and the unilateralist approach to it that Afghanistan must be one of the international community’s successes, on the basis of the UN Charter and with a pivotal role for the UN. Significant and positive changes have been made since the Taliban were ousted. This has been principally to the credit of the political forces in Afghanistan itself. The constitution that has just been adopted is a particularly important indicator of progress, guaranteeing as it does fundamental democratic and human rights, doing justice to all ethnic groups and stressing equal treatment for women and men – the latter being immensely significant not only in view of the overthrown regime’s brutal oppression of women and girls, but also in view of the fact that the situation remains totally unsatisfactory today, with women and girls still at a massive disadvantage, excluded from participation in many aspects of social life and with dreadful violence against women a fact of day-to-day life, with thousands of incidents. The international community must, as we do in our report, demand universal human rights, with women’s rights included among them. Whilst not adopting an imperial approach to doing this, it must be consistent. Despite these – and other – advances, the situation in Afghanistan is extremely volatile. The most pressing problems are the non-existent or minimal security in many regions, the potential for conflict inherent in the unbroken military might of warlords, governors and drug traffickers; the disarmament process has ground to a halt, it is proving difficult to demobilise soldiers from the private armies and reintegrate them into society, the Taliban are regrouping in some parts of the south and south-east of the country and there has been a dramatic increase in opium poppy cultivation and in drug trafficking. As these problems must not be allowed to prevent the forthcoming presidential elections being conducted successfully, I appeal to all Members of this House, and especially to those belonging to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, not to support the amendments seeking to delete the description of these problems. Were we to do that, we would, I believe, be doing the people of Afghanistan no favours, nor would we be doing ourselves any if we want to keep Afghanistan as an international policy priority. Let me also remind you in this regard that, when we recently honoured the Secretary-General of the UN by awarding him and his organisation the Sakharov Prize, we did so in memory of the UN personnel killed in Iraq; the warning of a worsening security situation given as recently as 15 January by Lakhdar Brahimi, who was at the time the UN’s special envoy in Afghanistan and is now its special envoy in Iraq, must be taken seriously. I would like to thank all my fellow members of the Committee, and all the groups. I believe that we had a common will to make clear how much Afghanistan is a priority. Many thanks also to the EU Commission, to its staff in Kabul and to Francesc Vendrell, its special representative there.  (Applause)

 Mr President, there is no doubt that Mr Brok, in his report, has very carefully summarised the opinion of the majority in this House as regards the problem of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. I just have to say something that will surprise nobody, that being that my group is not numbered among that majority. I would like to clarify, though, that I do think it necessary for the European Union to really pursue a common foreign policy – in parts, indeed, a foreign policy along Community lines. Without one, as the example adduced by Mr Andreasen shows, we will find it difficult or impossible to get the world to give us a hearing. I would like to stress that one good thing about this report, in my view, is that it defines as a real alternative a new approach to security and puts the emphasis on multilateralism. Its actual tendency, though, does not have the rigour that it needs to distinguish itself from something that I regard as giving cause for concern. I would like to highlight two examples. Firstly, I regret the committee’s inability to tackle the problem of the maintenance, defence and further development of the weapons monitoring and disarmament system. How are we to put a stop to the continuing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction if our own draft constitution obliges us to build up our own military capacities or potential, the like of which is to be found in no constitution in the world and never has been? We are, in effect, committing ourselves to rearmament instead of setting ourselves targets for disarmament. The American attitude towards the control of biological and chemical weapons, the Test Ban Treaty and their threat to withdraw from the Outer Space Treaty make this a very live issue. The second problem is that the report explicitly highlights the need to build up military capabilities, despite the European concentration on civil approaches to conflict prevention. In Europe, we can currently see positive examples of how conflicts have not escalated into warfare, one example being the Caucasus. Why not analyse these experiences and apply them generally? That we are at last making a start on a serious debate about the European Union’s security strategy is something that I very much welcome, but it is lamentable that this debate is still, on the whole, an internal affair in which the general public are not involved. I call upon the Council and the Commission to involve Parliament in the debate more than it has been so far, rather than confronting us with ready-made concepts.

 Mr President, it is obviously not a matter of dispute in this House that we want a really in-depth partnership with Russia, and the EU, or the candidate countries, and Russia did indeed, in the past make a great deal of progress – and face manifest problems – in this regard. Reference has already been made to the issues connected with the Kaliningrad region, which I believe have still not yet been satisfactorily resolved, not to mention the failure of the Russian Government or the European Union to make purposeful, comprehensive or even strategic use of the opportunities that might result from this problem. ‘Strategic’ is, in my mind, the key word in terms of what I am talking about. I believe that we should be evaluating the European Union’s joint strategy from June 1999 – to which Mr Oostlander has already referred – in a much more critical light. To date, I believe, it has been neither joint nor – in the literal sense of the word – a strategy, nor is the far more modest framework for relations between the European Union and Russia that we actually have being adequately realised. I would like, in the first place, to highlight our responsibility and the chances we have of a strategic partnership in the area of security policy. I believe it to be of great significance that the European Union and Russia are, by means of the strategic development of their relations, contributing to multilateralism, helping to strengthen international law, to advance international cooperation, the UN, international agreements and disarmament. I can also see the present need for the UN to have a role in the reconstruction of Iraq. Secondly, there is a need for our economic relations with Russia to develop further in terms of substance and of quality. I regard the energy alliance as very important indeed, but as not going far enough. It should, I think, be quite consciously about the development of economic ties that would to some degree be mutual and on an equal footing. I believe that to make economic sense, and that it could make a very close relationship between the European Union and Russia irreversible. I believe it to be also utterly unacceptable that Russia’s exports to the EU are arranged similarly to what one would expect from a developing country that is rich in raw materials. I know it will be very difficult to change that. This makes political efforts by both sides particularly important. Thirdly, any strategic partnership demands that both parties be consistent in their commitment to democracy and the implementation of human and minority rights. One has to accept that this will be evaluated in different ways. What is not acceptable is that human rights and their role should be regarded purely in terms of economic cycles, as I believe they are by many EU governments, especially as regards the issue of Chechnya. I see that as also a sign that there is no strategy. Let me conclude by saying that I hope that we, the European public, and also those of us who sit in this House, will, in our dealings with the Commission, the Council, and the Russian Government, have the courage to speak rather more resolutely about the strategic and institutional objective of a strategic relationship between the European Union and Russia, so that the door may be kept open.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Simitis, the President-in-Office of the Council, quoted the statement from the summit to the effect that Iraq's territorial integrity must be maintained. I do believe though – and hence my dissatisfaction – that you ought also to have mentioned that this territorial integrity is at this very moment under the most massive attack and that our most important task is to end this war. It is my belief that we can see, from day to day, how it is becoming more evident that this war is becoming ever more inhuman and more contrary to international law. For Mr Rumsfeld, the American Secretary for Defence, to describe it – as he did yesterday – as a humanitarian act, is something I can regard only as cynicism of a fairly barbarous kind. I believe that when the USA started the war a week ago, it mounted an assault on the most important principle of law for civilised nations, that being the obligation to resolve conflicts by peaceful means. This is a tragedy, particularly because this was not merely an instance of obligations and international law being violated, but also because it wrecked a great and outstanding opportunity for effective peacemaking. I believe that any common foreign policy on the part of the European Union – something that has again been referred to today – must be not merely common, but also an alternative, countering the USA's unilateralism, military power politics, and disregard for law and treaties with a strengthened United Nations, with the defence of the UN Charter, of international law and of the international ban on the use of force. Any such policy must deal with conflicts – not only the specific conflicts themselves, but also their causes – and promote cooperation across the board. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like right now – and without repeating too much – to draw your attention to three primary problems. For a start, my group continues to insist that this war be brought to an immediate end. Even though the numbers of the civilians and soldiers wounded or killed by bombs and other military measures are bad enough, neither the statements by the Council, nor the statements to the press, nor the statistics make any reference to the thousands of Iraqi children who are dying even now as a consequence of this war. Secondly, there is no doubt that this war puts the USA in breach of international law. It is even now openly threatening to break international law again. Last week, and quite openly, Mr Rumsfeld, the Secretary for Defence, ordered that the armed forces in the Gulf region be equipped with CS gas. You are well aware, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that there is no exception to the ban on the use in armed conflict even of non-lethal gases such as CS gas, contained both in the Geneva Protocol and in Article 1 of the Chemical Weapons Convention. I call upon you to object to the US administration's disregard and violation of such crucial international treaties, and to do so in unmistakeable terms. Thirdly, in Iraq there are tens of thousands of Iranians opposed to the regime in their own country, as well as Kurdish refugees from Turkey. Lingering in refugee camps, their fate attracts no international attention. They are very much at risk from this war and the threat of massacre hangs over them. I beg you to ensure that their plight becomes public knowledge, and to tell your Iranian, Turkish, American and British partners that the European Union will keep a close eye on what becomes of these people. Above all, Mr Simitis, have the courage to demand that the USA put an end to this war! (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it does not need to be repeated that this is an historic day, for this House at any rate. My group, too, sees the enlargement of the European Union as an historic opportunity, and a large majority of us will be endorsing Mr Brok's report. It is not entirely clear to me why you, Mr Haarder, like Mrs Malmström just now, spoke in terms of reunification. What is apparent to me from a reading of European history is that this continent has never actually been united. What is now underway is made all the greater an achievement by the fact that it involves uniting this continent for the very first time. I do not want to sound too discordant a note, but I do at least want to mention three problematic aspects that lead me to be somewhat dissatisfied with the report, despite the general approval it enjoys. For a start, I find it regrettable that nearly all the amendments relating to the great social and employment problems engendered in the candidate countries by enlargement and the processes of transformation have been rejected. Too little attention is paid to these issues even in practical policy-making. Secondly, my group continues to be dissatisfied with the way in which, in contrast to earlier accessions to the EU, there is no full guarantee that the new Member States and their citizens will enjoy equal rights from the word go. I know, Commissioner, that you have done a great deal for the public at large, but the egoism of a number of governments has prevented essential work from being done. I am well aware of the difficulties involved, but I find it rather problematic when legal and financial discrimination are not prevented from the very outset in a process of enlargement described as an historic task. Thirdly, we regret the fact that proposals for further efforts in border regions have not been incorporated in the report. It is my belief that the governments responsible in particular, and quite possibly also the Commission, are doing too little in these regions to give real support as extensive changes take effect. The possibility cannot at present be excluded that at least some of these regions will become more like enlargement's transit zones. Quite apart from the practicalities of the problem, I therefore again call on the Commission and the governments to do everything possible to make what are at present border regions workshops for European integration and enable them to experience its positive effects on people and society, as the former border regions such as for example the Saarland, Lorraine, and Luxembourg so emphatically did.

 Mr President, I am sure we all agree that the regime governing Iraq is without a doubt dictatorial, that it tramples all over human rights, and that in the past it has waged criminal wars using chemical weapons against Iran and Kuwait, and even against its own people. Mr Haarder, I find it rather striking and not just an academic question that just now you only mentioned the war against Kuwait. Why did you not mention that war against Iran, which involved a far greater number of deaths? I think the answer is obvious: the war against Iran was a war which at the time suited the West very well. It was the West that armed Hussein and even paved the way for him to have chemical weapons. The war against Kuwait was fought for this dictator's own reasons. If I say that this is not an academic issue, I say that that because we are seeking difficult answers in a very, very complicated situation. If we want to get to the roots of war and aggression we need to ask ourselves how such situations arise in the first place. There is also another point of view. Hussein is an unsavoury dictator whose military position has now been clearly undermined. There is very little to choose between him and some of our allies in the war on terror. In Iran we have a regime that uses torture and has nuclear arms, and a nuclear arms strategy little different from that of the United States. Quite remarkable! Last week President Bush was virtually paying court to Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the representative of one of the most reactionary regimes on this planet. Surely it weakens the credibility of our human rights policy and of our security policy if such people are our allies? I anticipate that my group will conclude that anyone who really wants to guarantee democracy, human rights and security cannot call for a war to secure them, and can certainly not indulge in hypocritical power politics that demonstrate the absurdity of our stated objectives. That is the key issue for my group. We are unreservedly against this war, come what may. However, I welcome the fact that – whatever the underlying motives may be – there has been very wide-ranging criticism indeed in this House of these preparations for war. That is far more important. With regard to the most recent Council of Foreign Ministers, I would like to say that I have come to respect you very much here in this Parliament, but what I have heard from you today demonstrates to me that you are totally trapped in your current position. That is unsatisfactory as far as I am concerned. I believe that a common European policy in this area would be valuable in its own right in view of the dangers of the present situation. I agree with Mr Poettering on that – a policy of this kind is urgently needed. But where is it? I believe that we are facing a serious crisis as regards the Common Foreign and Security Policy in what is a vitally important international relations situation. However, this community of interest cannot just be arbitrary. I think that it involves alternatives to the US approach, to a unilateralism that I find ever more threatening, and which I think is in any case counterproductive for the United States. So, as far as I am concerned, putting forward an alternative is anything but anti-American. We believe not only that this war should be unreservedly rejected but also that the inhumane and politically counterproductive embargo should be lifted, with the exception of arms exports, so that Iraq's exclusion from democratic development can be lessened. Thirdly, the UN inspectors should go back, but on the basis of the existing mandate. My fourth point is that we need multilateral cooperative relations and not unilateralism. And my fifth point is that we finally need to return to disarmament. You cannot say that you are willing to go to war to force others to disarm and at the same time rearm yourself without expecting weapons of mass destruction to proliferate. (Applause)

 Mr President, in my view, it is quite apparent that there is a large majority in this House in favour of a very critical position towards US policy on this issue. Let me make it clear that I am very gratified by the role played by the European Union in bringing the Statute to fruition and enabling the International Criminal Court to begin work. However, if this is to continue, this approach must be rigorously upheld. Mr President-in-Office, I think you have trivialised the problems in some respects, especially by painting an overly positive picture of transatlantic relations and Europe's ability to assert its position vis-à-vis the USA. This may well be true of the bananas issue, but if we look at the complexity of the trend over recent months – the attacks on the Chemical Weapons Convention, the obstructing of a monitoring organisation for biological weapons, the withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, the threat of withdrawal from the Outer Space Treaty and of renunciation of the Test Ban Treaty, the threat to the non-proliferation regime, the failure to support the Landmine Convention, and Kyoto, to name just a few – it is apparent that there are major problems and that issues of principle are at stake here. I think that the International Criminal Court is an even more fundamental issue in some respects. Mrs van der Laan has just said that American troops fought for freedom in Europe in the First and Second World Wars. I do not want to generalise here – for there are other examples in American history – but I do not entirely agree with her view. What is at stake here is a fundamental principle which is also enshrined in American history, namely the principle of common values, which has been underlined here and is now being called into question. Jean-Jacques Rousseau described the role of the law as follows: "In the relationship between the weak and the strong, it is liberty that oppresses and the law that liberates." A law which does not apply to the strong is extremely problematical. I therefore fully endorse the draft resolution on behalf of my group and would ask the Members of this House to vote for our amendment as well.

 It is not, unfortunately, the first time that today's topic occupies us, nor, unfortunately, has anything changed for the better in the past months. Although the Commission, when examining the competitive forces on the international stage, established that dumping was being practised and that competition was being blatantly distorted, the Council and the Commission have to date been neither prepared nor able to give the European shipbuilding industry effective support. It is of course all too easy to point only to South Korea's policy of giving subsidies. The existing situation is in every respect the result of the policy of global competition for sites, as advanced in the WTO by the Member States and by the Commission. We have just heard the news of the bankruptcy of the modern shipyard at Stettin in Poland. Thousands of jobs have been lost in a country preparing to join the EU and in any case faced with far-reaching upheavals. Nobody in Europe can or should hope to profit from this. Many of Europe's shipyards are located in less-favoured regions. This has to do with the cataclysmic consequences of an employment policy and an industry policy whose significance for the regions affected is far more than merely economic. That is why we cannot and will not accept the Council's and the Commission's failure to take practical action, and we expect further international efforts at resolving the problem.

 Mr President, my reading of this report differs from Mrs De Keyser's in that it is more positive. However, I would like to preface my remarks with a comment directed at you, Mr Gomolka. I believe we have to go a bit deeper still if we are to show cause and effect as they really are. When I was a scientific consultant at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, I saw how, in 1985, the USA, the principal western European powers and the Soviet Union kept quiet when it was reported that the Iraqi army was using chemical weapons against Iran. Policies like that, of course, build up dictators and facilitate their access to weapons of mass destruction. The report is, of course, inconsistent. There are contradictions in it. I would, though, highlight three things about it. For a start, it criticises Saddam Hussein's irresponsible policy towards his own people and towards the international community in a way that cannot be misinterpreted. It draws up demands that are necessary. Secondly – and it is this that I read in a quite different light – it raises what for me is the crucial issue of how the conflict is to be resolved, by emphasising, and I quote: ‘the importance of achieving a multilateral political solution in the region, under the aegis of the UN, as the only means of guaranteeing stability and peace in the region’. There must be no war. In this region of all regions, it would have the most menacing consequences, which would extend to every aspect of our relations with the Islamic and Arab world. This report, thirdly, calls for the lifting of economic and trade sanctions, at any rate in all cases without military interest. They are counterproductive and have catastrophic effects on Iraq's civilian population, above all for children. Hence, Baroness Nicholson, our esteemed rapporteur, I would like to thank you for this report; even though it might sound strange coming from this side of the chamber, I did find it a report written in the truly fine tradition of liberality.

 Mr President, I agree with much of the President-in-Office's statement, in particular about the need for a strategically positive relationship with the USA. However, I am also particularly grateful to Mr Lagendijk for identifying the key events so clearly. I do not think that it makes any sense to dub the problems in current relations with the USA as ‘cowardice in the face of amity’. I believe that it is urgently necessary, indeed I would even say that it is of the utmost urgency, to discuss transatlantic relations in a very open way. And that is the point, Mr President-in-Office, where there is a difference that has not been mentioned and that you did not touch upon. It seems that at present we do not have the courage to admit to ourselves that the role of the European Union in international relations is undoubtedly at risk because of this. We do not have the courage to admit that there are differences between us and the USA. We do not have the courage to admit that you can hardly say there is a common foreign and security policy at present. There are also significant developments beyond steel which will have serious consequences. I am certainly pleased that the business community in Europe has at least aired its differences of opinion and not just expressed unreserved support. There is the issue of withdrawal from the ABM Treaty and the issue of unilateral declarations involving clear legal violations. The problem in such cases is that those who have their headphones on hear, whilst those who stand around chatting do not get the message at all. So the United States has made a unilateral decision concerning the non-proliferation treaty. They are blocking controls on biological weapons. The United States is dismantling the control organisation for the chemical weapons treaty. There has been an announcement about withdrawal from the space weapons treaty. There have been violations of international humanitarian law, the withdrawal from Kyoto, and the non-ratification of the international protocol on the International Criminal Court. I do not want to say that this all adds up to a negative picture, but it is nevertheless clear that there are very big differences between the US and Europe here, and I can only agreed with what Mr Lagendijk has said about nuclear weapons. I am certain that that the plans of the US and probably Russia as well contain even more macabre scenarios, but the point of their becoming public knowledge is evidently to humiliate Russia, which has recently been so zealous in its support for the USA. I wish to call on the European Union to counter this trend towards genuine multilateralism and the strengthening of the UN, and it should take advantage of its position as a civilian power, a power that practises preventive conflict resolution, and it should actually develop a common foreign policy. The most important condition for this is that, regardless of everything we have in common, we should ensure that these differences are not allowed to be hidden in a kind of European policy blind spot.

My group welcomes the Commission's proposal to introduce a temporary defensive mechanism for European shipyards in the light of the breakdown in the negotiations to put an immediate end to the unfair international competition in the shipbuilding sector. We also fully support the parliamentary amendments contained in the report, and in particular the one extending the duration of the measure until the end of 2003. For some time now, together with colleagues from other groups, my group has been highlighting the general problems faced by European shipbuilding and the specific problems resulting from the international situation. In September, the Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left visited eastern Germany to familiarise itself with the situation faced by shipyards there and made renewed pleas to the Commission to take action. We see it as positive that a Commission proposal has now at last been tabled, which assures the yards, which have clearly suffered considerable damage because of unfair Korean trade practices, that help is at hand in the form of solutions which can be implemented quickly. Many of these yards are in structurally weak regions with very severe economic and social problems and form the core of the existing economic structure. Their existence and prosperity are the only way to secure thousands of jobs and safeguard the economic development of these regions. However, my group also believes that further measures are necessary to safeguard the future of European shipbuilding, which is one of the essential branches of European industry. These might include, in particular: - programmes to promote investment, which will have a long-term structural impact and create jobs; - the promotion of European cooperation on research and development in areas which affect the maritime economy; - the development of a coordinated maritime policy at European level; - the formulation and implementation of a European transport policy which seeks to move freight and passenger transport from the land to the sea. We call on the Commission to take a stance on the fundamental issues surrounding the future of European shipbuilding in the first half of 2002 and to propose an action programme to resolve the medium- and long-term problems.

Mr President, Commissioner, Madam Minister, nothing has been said in this debate which I cannot support. Nonetheless, I would like to raise three points which, in my view, should be emphasised to a far greater extent. Firstly, in the long term, we cannot expect other states to adopt security policies which are different from those we practise ourselves. If we do not want proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in this area, for example, a clearer signal must be sent out by the European Union and its partners. Secondly, there has obviously been a paradigm shift and a change in strategy in the USA on the verification issue compared with the 1980s. In view of the urgency of these issues in the wake of 11 September, the European Union's diplomatic restraint, which I have often understood, is inappropriate, and I hope that the USA's unilateralism, which has just been mentioned, will be overcome on the basis of their own experience. The third problem is the most crucial. It is wrong to point to the USA alone. This paradigm shift has obviously taken place here in Western Europe as well. If I look at the model under discussion for the Biological Weapons Convention as well, namely the monitoring organisation for chemical weapons, there is currently a financial crisis in which EU Member States also play a role. We have witnessed deterioration in the monitoring provisions since the Convention was first adopted. Perhaps this is symptomatic, Madam Minister: in May this year, I asked the Council for its comments on these issues. I have still not received a response, and I suspect that we, too, are approaching this issue with insufficient vigour.

Mr President, I join with Mrs Weiler in many of her assessments and conclusions, and also consider much of what has been presented by the Commission to represent definite progress. Mrs Weiler, I would like to express my congratulations to you on this work, but also wish to point out three major problems that I find in the real world, which is not quite as rosy as it is depicted in some of the Commission's assessments or, indeed, in this report. First among them is the strategy of full employment by 2010 on the basis of a 3% growth rate. I found that illusory from the very start. The problem with it, though, is that other ways of combating unemployment have been disregarded. It is lamentable that even Social Democrats stay aloof if you advocate the reduction of working hours. Scant regard is paid to elements of a third economic sector for social, ecological and cultural services or indeed to the greening of society. The second problematic aspect – one to which Mr Andersson has just referred – is the split development of employment policy. There are, of course, some positive trends. Full employment in engineering and in technical and managerial occupations has increased. Modernisation really does have winners. The other side of the coin is, though, a clear increase in part-time employment, especially of women, among whom it has now reached 45.7%. in the EU. The third problem is this: you have addressed the issue of the quality of work but, in my opinion, the social content of work is largely disregarded. The law on employment contracts is ‘made more flexible’ but in reality it is relaxed. We see the promotion of the low-wage sector. The right of the long-term unemployed to choose their work is being limited. It is precisely because these things are naturally long-term phenomena that we are, I believe, obliged to act with sensitivity in taking precautions, so that no new social division arises.

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, on behalf of my group I should like to say that we – at least the vast majority – consider the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to the European Union to be of strategic importance and we strongly support this accession process. Madam President-in-Office, if you have compared this accession process with others, I think it must be made even clearer that this accession process is qualitatively quite different, not only because of the number of countries, the languages, the territory, the population, but also historically, because it is a far-reaching cultural opening towards Central and Eastern Europe such as has hardly been discussed before, because it is an economic and social challenge on an entirely new scale, and, of course, also because of the far-reaching foreign and security policy implications. In the light of that, my agreement to what many of the previous speakers have said must be qualified. I think the policies pursued by the governments and also by the Commission are seriously flawed, even though I do recognise the commitment you have shown, Commissioner Verheugen, the progress made in negotiations and the great support given by the EU to the accession process. I would like to highlight five questions: Firstly, in my opinion the involvement of the citizens has been minimal. Secondly, hardly any attempt is being made to use the opportunity presented by eastward enlargement to overcome the Nice crisis and for the democratic and social shaping of European integration. Thirdly, equality for the accession countries has not in my opinion been adequately achieved. That applies to the question, which has already been raised, of the excessively long transitional periods for the free movement of workers just as much as to the lack of clarity that is now emerging over transfers to agriculture. Fourthly, I have to say clearly that the Commission’s recent decision on funding for border regions is irresponsible. A year ago, Mr Verheugen, you made quite different promises in the regions concerned. You are being measured against them there and I am measuring you against them. As you well know and others here have already mentioned, these are the very regions, above all others, where expansion will be experienced directly. Whosoever wants it to be an economic, social and political success and not a breeding ground for nationalist sentiment must change this position. Fifthly, I find it totally unsatisfactory that the number of Czech and Hungarian members of this Parliament was decided undemocratically in Nice and that that has still not been changed. Mr Hänsch, I was also surprised that the amendment I tabled in the matter to the report on the Czech Republic was supported by the European People’s Party and others in the Committee on Foreign Affairs but was not supported by the majority of the Social Democrats. Whether that was out of deference to the national governments that decided it, I do not know. At any rate we should agree that Parliament will in this matter be calling uncompromisingly for a change. I would like to thank everyone, including Mr Brok, for their reports. I believe that here, too, a critical, thoughtful attitude was formulated towards many aspects of the eastward enlargement strategy. But I would also like to draw attention to two differences, which in part also affect other reports. The first is the stereotypical concentration on economic and social deregulation and privatisation at the expense of social division and destruction which, given the scale of it, are unacceptable. The second difference concerns Mr Brok’s report. When it says that the expansion of the EU and NATO are sensible complements to each other, I would think that eastern enlargement of the EU also offers prospects for a productive and cooperative shaping of the relationship between Europe and Russia. But NATO expansion, especially under the conditions of current US and NATO policy, is in my view fraught with serious and in part incalculable risks. Finally, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office, it remains my great wish that the citizens might be able to experience EU enlargement as something that concerns them not primarily through glossy brochures, but that they might help to shape it as a democratic, social and ecological reality.

Mr President, I can only speak for a majority of my group on this issue. We support the Commission’s proposal and the report. I do not think there is any need to repeat several of Mr Swoboda’s criticisms which I agree with. Mr Brok’s remarks about the need for a preventive peace policy and civil crisis management render my own outline comments superfluous. Of course, it is quite correct to say that far more rapid and concerted action is required. However, I believe that there are also very different sides to this policy which have various drawbacks. Mr Brok, in your proposed Amendment No 2, you state – quite rightly, in my view – that financial support can be provided to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as far as it proceeds towards a well-functioning legal state, including cooperation with the International Court Tribunal in the Hague. However, if at the same time a violation of rule-of-law principles is extorted, in effect, above all by the USA but apparently also by the German Chancellor, this policy is more likely to discredit the rule of law and democratic development in the long term. I see these contradictions in other areas too. Macedonia has been mentioned. For many months, we have courted the KLA, without any decommissioning of arms taking place. KFOR therefore shares the blame for developments in Macedonia and the outbreaks of fresh conflict. In Kosovo, we pursued a policy which was designed to prevent ethnic cleansing; today, we witness other completely unacceptable instances of ethnic cleansing in the wake of the NATO campaign. In my view, this is incompatible with a preventive and sustainable security policy. I believe that the time has come to move away from a policy which contains the conflicts and limits the damage to which it has itself contributed. It is time to expect and demand democracy, the rule of law and the protection of minority and human rights not only from our political opponents but also to practise them even when they stand in the way of our own power-political interests. I think that the positive developments in Yugoslavia have genuinely achieved a great deal, but changes in NATO and EU policy are long overdue.

 Mr President, this morning Mr Karas said that there will be a large majority in favour. I will not be part of that majority. I believe that the Commission's proposal and also the report imply a continuation of the fundamental change in European retirement provision systems and also in social security in general. By that I mean a move away from legal systems based on solidarity and towards private capital-based systems. My criticisms relate above all to two issues. The first is this: are occupational pension schemes in the EU to be subject to Community-wide competition? I have certainly learnt a great deal over the last ten years about competition and what it can achieve, but no one can convince me that an issue as fundamental as social security provision in old age should be subject to competition. There are three specific problems here. The first is that there are no binding rules governing the security of contributions paid in. Secondly, I believe that the supervisory arrangements are inadequate, and, thirdly, there is the fact that in your report, Mr Karas, there is the additional option of an occupational pension being paid out by way of a lump sum. That implies enormous risks in old age. The second major problem is this one-sided orientation towards financial markets. Everything that can be said has already been said about that. As I see it, this has more to do with the present and future of Europe's capital markets than it has with the future of pensions. The scope for maintaining and updating legal pensions systems based on solidarity has not been used to the full in any Member State of the European Union. However, what we really need is European coordination of occupational pension systems, as is already the case with legal pension insurance systems. That problem has not been solved here.

 We take the current and future problems of pensions policy and social change very seriously. The Commission communication and the report by Mr Cercas undoubtedly contain important and positive proposals. The calls for better social protection for women are a case in point. However, as regards the basic problem – defending and renewing social protection systems based on solidarity – the report conflicts with the fundamental positions held by our group. We therefore cannot vote for the report. The general emphasis on solidarity is clearly at odds with the specific proposals. The majority of Members of the European Parliament fully support the shift away from statutory pensions schemes based on solidarity towards a three-pillar model of pensions provision. The report does not develop any fundamental alternatives to the pensions reform initiated by the decisions taken at the Lisbon and Stockholm European Councils, which lacked a social framework. I think it is especially tragic that by promoting the partial privatisation of pensions systems based on solidarity, European social democracy is breaking radically with its entire historical tradition. For more than a hundred years, social democracy has fought for a redistributive welfare state based on solidarity. Now it is at the forefront of the campaign to dismantle it. The emphasis on demographic arguments, such as the 'greying' of the European societies, is not convincing. Furthermore, no attempt is made to examine other options – such as the inclusion of all types of income in financing the pensions system, as in Switzerland – in terms of their viability. 'Live longer, save more, spend less!' These are the watchwords of the 'pensions reform'. The Commission and the High-Level Working Party on Social Protection are calling for new regulations to push back the current retirement age. In future, the statutory pension will no longer maintain a person's existing living standards in old age, but will merely offer basic provision. Maintaining pensions systems based on solidarity is possible even under current and future conditions as long as policies are guided by the principle of social justice rather than the self-seeking interests of banks, investment funds and insurance companies. We therefore see no reason why we should go along with the proposed change of strategy.

 Mr President, as far as the general situation is concerned, I would echo fully the concerns and criticisms expressed by the two previous speakers. I would ask you to bear with me, however, if I concentrate exclusively on the situation of the shipyards in eastern Germany. In the image of the boxing ring, which Mr Gomolka used, the east German shipyards must, in addition, climb into the ring wearing handcuffs. They are facing rigid restrictions on production capacity and, of course, I know that these were the condition for high subsidies in the nineties. But firstly, they are managed bureaucratically and secondly, no account is taken of the fact that these shipyards do in fact also continue to invest during the general process of rationalisation. The resulting growth in productivity triggers further cuts in the workforce. The Commission has very good statistical data about the dramatic situation in eastern Germany, Commissioner. It is one thing to read that one in every three people there is seeking work, however, and quite another perhaps to experience it first-hand. I do not wish to be misunderstood. I am very well aware that since 1990 the Union has acted in great solidarity with east Germany and that the Commission has done a great deal. Of course, the Federal German Government is also called upon to act here. But in the specific case of the shipbuilding industry, the decision lies, above all, with the Commission. I think that the Treaty of Amsterdam offers sufficient room for manoeuvre for political action to be taken and for the saving clause on capacity restrictions in the Treaty to be used in 2001. In my view, it is necessary, firstly, to make the quotas more flexible so that they are no longer annual but are applied for the remaining five years; secondly to factor-in the impact of rationalisation and take this into account and, thirdly – and I really support this point – to reintroduce general production aid for as long as South Korea causes these gross distortions of competition.

Mr President, Mr Swoboda's proposals for the Council regulation are appropriate, in my view. I think they would enhance the regulation. I would also like to thank him very much for his explanations. I do not want to repeat the criticism of the situation in Turkey which has already been expressed by Mr Swoboda, Mr Lagendijk and Mr Oostlander. The situation has certainly not improved in recent weeks and months. Our parliamentary group recently sent a delegation to Turkey; it came back with devastating reports from people affected, which we would gladly make available to the Commission, the Council Presidency or our parliamentary colleagues. But I do not want to go into that here. Mr Swoboda, you said that the ball is now well and truly in the Turkish half of the pitch. What would be the result of this Austrian footballing analogy, I wonder? Which side will score? And if it is at the EU's end, is it an own goal? What we need, as I am sure you will agree, is for this process to set the ball rolling towards democracy, human rights, and the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria. But I believe that in Turkey, the ball – which really is in the Turkish half of the pitch – is viewed in a completely different way. I believe that what has happened recently has been provocation. It is not an attempt to pursue the application for EU membership towards its proper goal; it is an end in itself, in order to secure financial resources, to utilise the benefits conferred by the Customs Union, or even to ensure that the criticism of the situation in Turkey is toned down. This brings me to the real issue which I would like to raise. Alongside the necessary and very candid criticism of the situation in Turkey, should we not be examining our own policies very critically as well? Since Helsinki – and, indeed, in Helsinki – it seems as if the Council and Commission have been the victims of their own propaganda, increasingly having to justify the fact that progress has been made. Mr Verheugen, you informed us here on 14 November that we have, and I quote, "good cause to hope that we will achieve precisely what we set out to achieve, i.e. that our policy will help the forces of reform in Turkey give new impetus to the reform process and press on with reform…". I would claim that the reality is very different. I realise that diplomacy often has to work very cautiously, but we should not be taken in by our own propaganda, or Turkey's. We should approach the debate honestly and strengthen the forces of reform, thus opening the way for Turkey into the European Union.

 Mr President, I should like to start by extending my express thanks to Mr Morillon and Mr Seppänen for their reports. Mr Morillon, in my view, your report is an exceptionally realistic and responsible report. We have indeed seen a number of interesting symbolic acts on the part of the Turkish Government since the Helsinki Council resolution several months ago. However, nothing has been done to change the horrendous situation in Turkish jails, discrimination against the Kurds or Turkey's policy on Cyprus. The constitutional role of the Turkish military, which is irreconcilable with the rule of law and democratic mores, has become, without doubt, one of the keys to future relations between the EU and Turkey and will only be resolved if the military relinquishes its power. There may well be differences of opinion on the Morillon report within my group, but one thing is clear – and I imagine this is true of the other groups – and that is that we have no intention whatsoever of mitigating our criticism on these issues. Compromise is possible almost everywhere, except here. The most important and tangible result so far is that a debate has begun and a certain degree of political differentiation has started to emerge in Turkey. We must acknowledge and actively support this. Nonetheless, what we are looking for here is not just compliance with the Copenhagen criteria but compulsory democratic standards. Turkey's membership on this basis, rather than for the geo-strategic reasons put forward by the USA or NATO, would enrich the European Union and represent a significant step towards a united Europe. I have not overlooked the problems which this might cause, such as the fact that, geographically, the EU would then stretch well beyond Europe into what are highly unstable regions from the point of view of security policy. The fact that the strategic aspects of the prospects of European integration have been addressed neither by the governments nor, Commissioner, by the Commission, and have not been discussed with Parliament in connection either with Turkey's candidate status or with current enlargement to the east is, in my view, unacceptable given the implications. In my experience – the experience, I may add, of a life which knows just as much about radical social change as the refusal to recognise the need for it in time –, there is no substitute for critical candour. Anything else would simply play into the hands of those in the EU and in Turkey who oppose this membership. And that is where, Commissioner Verheugen, I start to lose the plot in your progress report. When you visited Turkey in March, you at least referred to the Kurdish problem by name, as you did here today. Your report makes no mention of this problem per se. I think that is a tragic step backwards in comparison with the old Commission's 1999 report. Truth is where the concept corresponds with its reality. At least that is what Mr Hegel believed. I have yet to see any real progress in Turkey, but I do believe it is possible. But, in my book, the Commission report is a real step backwards. (Applause)

Mr President, we all know, to borrow a phrase from Mr Brok’s report, that accession will mean a major shock to economic, social, political and cultural development in the countries in question and just how deeply that shock will reverberate. I would gladly discuss the specifics of the Council’s enlargement policy but that would presuppose that there is an openly and clearly-defined policy and if reference was made today to the huge significance of Gorbachev’s glasnost for subsequent German reunification, then we too should demand that glasnost be practised in the Council and in connection with enlargement eastwards. I am not surprised, under present circumstances, that enlargement has hardly penetrated the consciousness of our citizens or that it is increasingly accompanied by worry and suspicion, whereas today’s debate and all thirteen reports demonstrate the common commitment of large sections of the European Parliament to enlargement to the east and to enlargement configured in a responsible, forward-looking manner. As far as I am concerned, three criteria are more important in relation to all the problems than the not insignificant criticism which I have on individual points. First, the democratic wish of the countries and people in question must be respected after their accession to the EU. It exists so far, but will possibly be jeopardised by a bureaucratic lack of transparency and the obvious, but not public resistance of certain governments. It is therefore urgent and imperative not to allow institutional reform of the EU or enlargement to be postponed. I also call for individual countries to be given possible target dates. Secondly, I am one of those who are disquieted by current neo-liberal trends in the EU. The various reports reflect this mainstream attitude. Nonetheless, the truly historic opportunity of enlargement must be defended for the sake of stability and security and the chance to develop cultural diversity and configure a new large economic area in Europe. Thirdly, acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the individual countries and for the EU as a whole basically depend – and Denmark demonstrated this – on dismantling the social and democratic deficits of European policy. We cannot therefore just make demands on the candidate countries. Enlargement is basically a challenge for the EU itself to reform and an opportunity to steer the social, employment policy and democratic aspects of European integration as a whole. Provided that the reports, especially Mr Brok’s overall report are not spoilt on these points during tomorrow’s vote, I shall vote in favour of them all. (Applause)

 Madam President, opinion differs in my group as to the proposed enlargement of the European Union. Personally, I see it as an historic necessity and opportunity, which must not be put at risk either by rashness, undemocratic procedures, and bureaucratic or national small-mindedness, or politicians‘ lack of consideration for the social dimension. Commissioner, I do not doubt your personal commitment to enlargement. Yet if you tell us, as you have done today, that we simply misinterpreted the interview, and I then read, in tomorrow‘s edition of die Zeit
, your own comments to the effect that the interview was your annual flop, then I am bound to wonder what is going on here! (Applause)
 I would urge you once again to clarify the situation for us. In July, you dropped some very vague hints about the difficulties. Despite being asked to do so, you were not prepared to be more specific at the time. You are absolutely right to say that the people must be involved in the decision-making processes. But that means of course, that the democratically elected representatives should be given these opportunities too. I believe we must see an end to the excessively secretive brand of diplomacy employed by the Council and the Commission towards Parliament. There is a second problem. I emphatically support your view that national governments must not overwhelm the people with existential decisions, as happened – I would agree with you on this point – in the case of the euro. But a German referendum must never be allowed to determine the weal and woe of enlargement. That would be insensitive and unacceptable to my mind. Aside from that, you will receive our unswerving support if you are serious about democratic participation. However, I also recall that you yourself dismissed out of hand the idea of having a referendum on the Treaty of Maastricht, in Germany at the time. Thirdly – and this is the most important point – if we are to win the people’s support for enlargement and accession then their hopes and fears must be taken very seriously. As I see it, there is more to this than launching a PR campaign costing EUR 150 million; it means highlighting the democratic, social and employment dimensions of enlargement. There has been precious little sign of this so far, either in the debate on a Charter of Fundamental Rights, in EU reform undertakings, or in the accession negotiations. Commissioner, please use your considerable and acknowledged ability to help make eastward enlargement a project for joint security and social solidarity, and one that can be jointly decided on and shaped by the people of Europe. Then you will have us all on your side.

 Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Imbeni, has done an excellent job. There is no need to repeat anything. I should like to expand on two problematic issues. The first is a question of principle. Humanitarian aid has to be provided regardless of what has caused the catastrophes concerned and irrespective of any other political objectives. Its increasing politicisation in recent years is an unacceptable and, ultimately, also inhumane phenomenon. But at the same time, it should also be noted that the growing number of catastrophes is not only due to natural events over which we have no control. As it is, this cannot be said of wars, in which humanitarian aid has to be supplied, perhaps by ECHO. An increasing number of natural disasters are clearly linked to the fact that we are placing ever greater demands on the global ecosphere and biosphere. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, has reported, for example, that we can already see a, "discernible human influence on global climate". Our concepts of crisis management ought therefore, in my opinion, also to have a socio-political dimension and be integrated into development policy and, for example, economic policy strategy. Otherwise we will, in many cases, only be repairing the damage inflicted as a consequence of our own policy, and the people in the countries of the South, in particular, will suffer as a result of the disasters which we have caused. The second problem is directly linked to the first and yet is of a very practical nature. I call on the Commission – even if the extensive problem which I have just outlined is not yet resolved – to link the design, organisation and operation of humanitarian aid more closely to development policy. The Commission has already made attempts to do this, which I feel still need to be stepped up considerably and freed of red tape. An example of this is, in my opinion, the concept of emergency relief which is geared to development, which the Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (Company for Technical Cooperation) is trying to put into practice.

 Mr President, no one denies, Mr Duisenberg, that you and the European Central Bank are operating a very competent and successful monetary policy. Nevertheless, people’s concerns about the euro’s low exchange rate need to be taken far more seriously, because it is one of the root causes of inflationary trends and higher interest rates. However, the real and very fundamental criticisms I want to make relate to other areas. The report welcomes the improvement in the ECB’s information policy. Yet we are refused the information we really need – publication of the minutes of meetings – on the grounds of the ECB’s independence. But the ECB is not privately owned. It should be fully accountable to the people who own it, the citizens of the European Union. It is one of the European Union’s most powerful institutions and this complete surrender of policy and democracy to the ECB cannot continue. There is a second problem that worries me. (Heckling)
 Yes, and why not? There is a second problem that worries me. This narrowing of monetary and financial policy down to price stability is reflected in paragraph 9 of your report, Mr Radwan, where the rather revealing wording states that developments in labour markets and social security systems should support the ECB’s stability policy, rather than the reverse, which would be more appropriate in view of the dramatic problems in these fields. Lastly, I wish to raise a third question, which I will at least touch upon. There is not a word in the report about the unparalleled over-expansion of international speculative financial markets. In my view, this will result in inflationary trends in the medium term, and at present it is the cause of a totally unacceptable shift away from companies dependent on labour and real economic factors and towards speculative profit making. I hope that it will at last be possible to have a serious and essential debate with you about this trend and about instruments capable of influencing it, such as the Tobin Tax. (Applause)

Mr President, this report again demonstrates that liberalisation, the free market and competition are currently seen as the universal panacea to nearly every economic and other problem. Yes, I am aware of the few positive developments in European energy policy. Without doubt, electricity prices have fallen. However, the fact that the prices of some other forms of energy have spiralled is passed over in modest silence. Such facts do not fit in with liberalisation mania. On balance, I feel that a number of very serious problems and misdirected developments in EU energy policy have not been addressed. First, I would like a discussion on the current, completely non-liberal practice already referred to of massively subsidising nuclear and fossil-fuel energy in their many and varied forms. Secondly, the EU directive on the internal electricity market must be supplemented by an EU-wide supply directive which promotes an ecological and decentralised energy economy. Thirdly, a radical rethink of the EU's promotion policy is also needed so as to promote energy savings from renewable sources of energy and regionalised energy policies, rather than the construction of high-voltage lines for a centralised energy economy. Fourthly, I should like to warn against subverting local energy operations by liberalising right across the EU, as we are doing at present. Economic aspects and the democratic strength and power of local energy authorities to act, socially and otherwise, are at stake here and must not be sacrificed to liberalisation at any price.

Mr President, there are matters which give rise to fundamental differences of opinion and this is obviously one of them. You, Mrs Lalumière, have obtained the backing of a large majority in committee and you will no doubt maintain this majority in plenary. This majority confirms the quality of your work and the care which has gone into it. But it also confirms how weak the critical voices have become. I do not see this is a cause for celebration. Even official threat analyses confirm that there is no military threat to the countries of western Europe. Instead, scenarios such as the war in Kosovo or imaginary crises in the future, Islamic fundamentalism or, as in the German defence guidelines, even possible ecological threats are wheeled out in order to justify huge military spending. It marks the capitulation of politics and of the intellect, when such problems are met with a military response. Let me pick up on just one issue, an issue which figured at the centre of all the positions taken here today: the war in Kosovo. I think that the Council, the Commission and we ourselves are drawing the wrong conclusions in principle from a war which was wrong in principle. First, the violation of international law, as practised by NATO, and which, for the rest, still forms part of the official NATO military strategy, should not shape future security policy. Secondly, I am convinced that the war against Yugoslavia could and should have been avoided with a consistent, preventive, long-term policy, especially as events over the last few days have again shown dramatically that its alleged or actual aim of safeguarding human and minority rights failed disastrously. War, if anything, is the most unsuitable and most counter-productive method in this respect. Finally, when it is again argued that the war in Kosovo demonstrated that the EU needs major military independence from the USA then, to my mind, this begs the conclusion that militarising international relations and security policy will increase, not reduce dependency on the USA. Military is what the USA does best. My group takes an opposing view in principle to the present prevalent European security policy on at least three counts. First: the security policy template is a military, not a political, civil or cooperative one and the section on preventive and civil security policy cannot hide that fact. It is interesting that military resolutions have been coming thick and fast since the Helsinki Summit while, to all intents and purposes, nothing has been done about a civil, cause-orientated security policy. Secondly: we reject a European military block formation. The only viable approach, in our view, is to restore the central role of the UNO for international security, reinforce the OSCE, design cooperative security concepts and radically disarm. Thirdly: we are deeply concerned at how automatically demands are rejected which, until just recently, formed part of a broad political consensus, at least between Mrs Lalumière and, for example, the positions represented in my group. In all events, demands for an unequivocal declaration on the UN charter, defence of the ABM treaty, respect for the policy of neutrality of certain EU Member States or an increase in funds for peace education and peace studies failed to muster a majority in committee. Germany has earmarked DM 17.5 million for civil conflict management projects this year. I think it is a fairly typical figure. It represents – and let me say this very slowly – 0.00029% of military spending. I fear that this policy first creates crises which it then endeavours to control. Which is why there is nothing left for us but to say a firm No.

Mr President, I have very mixed feelings about the recommendations on economic policy put forward by the Commission, and also about the report by Mr Katiforis, and I feel there is a great deal of food for thought. However, we reject the overall view. Firstly, it is quite astonishing how ready the other groups are to accept, without criticism, a fairly dogmatic kind of neo-liberalism. Reference is made in the recitals, with evident concern, to the decline in public investment in infrastructure, yet in the conclusions one is expressly warned against an active public investment policy.   In my view, flexibility, liberalisation and monetarism are the one-sided aspects of this policy. Given that express reference is made to the fact that current economic policy is guided by the objectives of the Stability Pact, and the Commission wants to go further still, then it is obvious that social, cultural and environmental needs will inevitably be sacrificed to this as a matter of principle.   Secondly, owing to radical technological change, and I quote: “an overall revision in the conditions of work, remuneration and taxation” is being called for, with no reference to the need to conserve and rejuvenate the social and participatory institutions that have determined the nature and success of the European social model.  Thirdly, as someone has already mentioned, this report talks in terms of a new fetishism for growth. Full employment, and even the transition to the knowledge-based society are thought to be almost exclusively dependent on higher growth. On the other hand, there is no reference whatsoever to the fair distribution of available gainful employment, the realisation of a modern, third economic sector for social, cultural and environmental services, regionalisation of economic cycles, demand-orientated policy, or even the content of a knowledge-based society in social, educational policy and cultural terms. It is evident from the recitals that, for the sake of economic growth, allowance is even made for transgression of the vital Kyoto Agreement on the climate. Now that is what I call scandalous! Fourthly, the report advocates further flexibilisation of the financial systems, as opposed to at last getting to grips with the fact that this policy benefits speculative currencies and share operations, and disadvantages real economic investment, which clearly accounts for the structural weakness of investments lamented in the report. In economic policy terms, reason dictates that we should at last think seriously about concepts such as the Tobin tax.

Madam President, I should like to expressly thank Mr Belder for his report. Racism, xenophobia and antisemitism are a depressing problem, including within the European Union. Fighting them is one of the common goals of almost every political group in this House. This House is prepared to exercise diplomatic restraint in many areas, but not on this question. And rightly so. Mr Belder knows that I and the committee wished to quote the specifics of individual problems in candidate countries. A number of proposed amendments by Baroness Ludford attempt to rectify this and I shall support them. The way in which the social causes of racism in candidate countries and the highly significant social and employment policy consequences of a consistent anti-racist policy have been dealt with appears to me to be too general. The fact that Mr Belder was prepared to clearly address the question of antisemitism is one of the most important results of the discussion process and I again extend my thanks to Mr Belder. Leafing through the various positions of the Commission, the European Parliament, the Council of Europe and the Vienna Monitoring Centre, one is struck by the fact that antisemitism is quoted as a particular and particularly dangerous form of racism in several headlines, but only in the headlines. There is almost a total lack of analytical appraisal or special programmes to combat it. And as far as the Commission programmes in the candidate countries are concerned, Commissioner, the word “almost” can be dispensed with. I consider this an unacceptable oversight and I therefore refer this question to you specifically. Antisemitism is, without doubt, widespread; often it is latent, which complicates the issue. This morning in this House we were witness to one of its most repulsive forms, when the age-old assertion that the Jews themselves are responsible for antisemitism was repeated. This debate should therefore be a separate and very, very specific task for us and the Commission.

 Mr President, let me begin by saying that I have no problem with approving this very sound report in principle. I just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to Macedonia and the effectiveness of EU financial and other support. I am referring to the sanctions against Yugoslavia. Do not misunderstand me: I too believe that we need to take effective action against the Milosevic regime. But firstly, these sanctions have a far-reaching and adverse impact on many of the neighbouring states too, including Macedonia, which find themselves in an extremely difficult economic situation as it is. Secondly, the entire population of Yugoslavia is being held accountable for the actions of Milosevic and his circle, which is wrong on humanitarian grounds and politically counterproductive. So I believe that we should take today’s debate as an opportunity to call for a rapid end to the policy of sanctions, as stated in Amendment No 10.

 Mr President, unlike several of those who have spoken in today’s debate, I am inclined to endorse the Andersson report, one of the reasons for this being that I can see clear differences between the report and the Commission’s communications. In particular, I am referring to the fact that this report – and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this – defends the European social model’s approach, which is one based on solidarity. I would like to highlight the clear positions adopted against social dumping, together with the right to a basic level of social security, the goal of social convergence, and, in particular, the quite specific points that have been made about equal opportunities for women being the primary objectives of this social policy.  I can certainly see that it has its shortcomings in failing to undertake a sufficiently rigorous analysis of macroeconomic policy within the European Union, and it is this policy which stands in the way of the aforementioned solidarity-based revival of the European social state, model. All in all, though, I deem this report to be worthwhile.

Madam President, we cannot just keep repeating the number which several previous speakers have quoted; we must also mention the fact, Commissioner, that 80% of these huge, daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days. We cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short-term sales of foreign currency and shares. We cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action. We cannot maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activities increases more and more quickly. It has been demonstrated in Germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7.6% of overall economic income since Tobin developed his idea. We cannot maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the speculative arguments surrounding short-term currency fluctuations. Nor do I believe that this is impracticable. Why should it not be possible for the G7 countries, the other EU Member States, China, Singapore and Switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the Tobin tax? There must be an overriding economic interest. Why should it be impracticable, and it can be differentiated, to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions, all the so-called cash transactions, currency futures and options? Why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long-term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short-term and speculative investments unattractive. Numerous very difficult questions are bound to arise, but the only real problem which I can see so far is one of political will and the St. Florian principle of shifting responsibility from one agency to another which has now taken hold.

Mr President, as far as the content of the two reports is concerned, I would find it relatively easy to support them, despite certain shortcomings. They succeed in presenting the political requirements of cooperation with Turkey clearly and consistently, especially the need for compliance with, and development of, human rights, including the rights of the Kurdish people, the demand for the abolition of capital punishment, the strengthening of the civil society, greater involvement by non-governmental organisations and the abolition of social deprivation and regional under-development. The fact that these changes were necessary reflects badly on the Commission. The fact that they were possible reflects well on the parliamentary committee and the work of Mr Morillon. Nonetheless, my decision has been made extraordinarily difficult. The Commission maintains in its proposal that a process of democratisation and promotion of human rights has been introduced in Turkey and we heard similar words from Mr Prodi this afternoon. The committee, on the other hand, only talks clearly of the need for such a process, but not of an allegedly positive development already under way. Not only does that appear to be decidedly more realistic to me; it also tallies with the evaluation which the Commission itself made in a communication to the Cologne Summit on 3 and 4 June this year. Twice it says that it sees no noticeable improvement, at least on the Kurdish question, and it rates any chance of further improvement as doubtful given the rise of, in the Commission’s words, the ultra-nationalist MHP party. I am most baffled as to what our optimism is actually based on and why the Commission has circulated two contradictory assessments. From where I stand, it appears perfectly clear that there has been no real, positive development in the issues raised. The Turkish Vice-Premier Bahcelý of the MHP stated in connection with the upholding of the death sentence on Öçalan – perhaps it only appeared in the German newspapers – that Europe should not be encouraged to interfere even more boldly in Turkish affairs and President Ecevit expressed the view that a judgement by the Court of Justice in Strasbourg need not be accepted. That clearly contradicts the commitments entered into by Turkey as a member of the Council of Europe. Their own international legal commitments continue to be openly disregarded by Turkish officials when it comes to human rights. I consider the honest offer of membership of the European Union to Turkey to be strategically correct and necessary. The European Union must have room for and an interest in including Turkey and must clarify that unequivocally once and for all. However, there can be no cutting back on demands for democratisation of the constitution and political realities, fundamental improvements in respect for human rights, a political solution to the Kurdish question and an end to the occupation of northern Cyprus. All this is still outstanding. Tomorrow we must adopt either the Commission version or the committee version of Article 3(2). Both versions contain terms for suspending cooperation in the event of fundamental violations of human rights. I see these violations and therefore consider that it is wrong to pass this text at this point in time. That would push our own paper and our own credibility ad absurdum
. My group therefore is in favour under these circumstances of deferring both reports. We sent a proper signal to the Russian Government in a similar situation two weeks ago. We should handle this matter in the same way.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the clear way in which you have presented the Commission’s position, although this definitely does not mean that I am in full agreement with it. I would like to protest at your assertion that nowhere and at no time is it possible to take nuclear power stations out of operation overnight. You know, coming as you do from Germany, that if it is necessary, and I am thinking here of the Greifswald nuclear power station, it can be done overnight, provided, of course, that there is the necessary political will and that the necessary environment is created. I am also not deluding myself that in the Central and Eastern European countries, there are some extremely difficult issues which are in part economic and even social. However, I also believe that I am forced to protest, and perhaps this has something to do with the undecidedness of energy policy within the European Union, if in the cases in question you ultimately see safety in terms of shutdown, with which I agree, yet when it comes to comparable power stations in the CIS States you want to ensure safety by upgrading and by the European Union promoting safety measures. I believe that our objectives within the European Union and in the candidate countries can only be achieved by shutting down power stations. Setting another rule outside the Community, as in the cases under consideration here, I consider to be highly problematic and I believe that all in all we would be well advised to make shutting down the rule not just in Eastern Europe but for energy policy within the European Union as a whole and to not endanger the possibilities of this by carrying out further deregulation.

 Mr President, my views involve some important distinctions. For example, I see the enhancement of regional and local employment initiatives and the greater emphasis on equal opportunities for women in employment policy as being positive, although I believe that Mrs Theorin’s criticism in this respect is still valid. Nevertheless, I think that the basic positions are inadequate. Each one of us has too many unemployed people amongst his or her constituents. We should have rejected that old chestnut put forward by the Commission that the unemployed ought to be encouraged, by deregulating the labour market and imposing social constraints, to look for work or seek assistance under employment policy measures. I believe that the causes of mass unemployment are essentially structural and socio-political. Sweeping references to service sector jobs in the USA make the picture quite clear: everyone knows that these are mainly underpaid jobs with no social security net. Anyone who wants to follow this US model is accepting or even participating in the destruction of the welfare state in Europe. I also regret that it has become fashionable to ignore macroeconomic analysis. As long as financial markets are more lucrative than investing in business, then the problem of unemployment will no doubt remain unsolved. I therefore urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to support the amendment that refers to this.

Mr President, I too consider it an important step but, unlike Mr Haarder, I am extremely dissatisfied. Three obvious things come to mind. Firstly, I find it depressing that a Code allowing arms to be exported to Indonesia up to the summer of 1999 is obviously totally insufficient. Secondly, if the rules are so totally different whereby arms exports to Yugoslavia are prohibited by law, but are permitted to Indonesia, for example, then clearly standards other than those contained in the Code, namely economic interests and trade, hold sway. Thirdly, it naturally occurs to me that the dependency of governments on these economic interests is so great that no uniform standards are enforceable in this regard. It is for this reason that I considered it extremely necessary that this Parliament is included in supervising arms exports, over and above the transparency which is desirable.

 Mr President, I believe that what is being considered here will probably be the most serious international agreement ever. It is therefore all the more depressing for me that, so far, no comprehensive evaluation of the consequences of the Uruguay Round has been made. During our discussion on food safety yesterday, I wondered how we are really doing on the safety issue, as few of today’s consequences have stemmed from the deregulation which has already begun. The fact that the mandate for negotiation has barely been discussed in national parliaments I find all the more unacceptable. I think that it is shameful that we must accept that many developing countries who are contractually bound within the framework of this discussion to take part and above all who are directly concerned, for financial reasons cannot sit down at the negotiating table at all. It is also shameful that so little of the proceedings will be open to the public. If there is one thing then that I would call for, in the short time I have left, I would wish that this Parliament, across all Parties, guarantees this openness to the public, and that there is transparency and intensive discussion.

 Mr President, it is good that greater attention is to be paid to animal welfare requirements in future by shortening transport times and improving transport conditions. It is far more important, however, that there should be a marked reduction in animal transports themselves. That really would be in the animals’ interests, and it would also make it more difficult for dangerous animal diseases to spread and reduce environmental pollution from carbon dioxide emissions. Most people think it is uncivilised to drive animals hundreds or even thousands of kilometres across Europe and the world for slaughter. They rightly demand that animals be transported to the nearest abattoirs and be marketed from there. It is after all much easier to deliver frozen meat to remote areas. Transports of slaughter animals should be limited to four hours. That is long enough to reach an abattoir from almost any farm anywhere in Europe. The report says the cross-border transport of animals is necessary because of the unequal distribution of resources and demand, owing to geographical and historical factors. I cannot support that view. EU subsidies have nevertheless been widely used to encourage concentration of abattoir capacities. The main reason is the policy of liberalisation and concentration, which is destroying regional trade patterns. So long as this policy is applied, everything that is to be done to protect animals during transport will be treating the symptoms and not the cause. What the report says about giving priority to slaughter close to place of rearing, financial support for local slaughterhouses or the use of mobile slaughterhouses will be impossible to achieve in a European Union of 25 Member States. The reality is different. The merger trend in the slaughtering industry is continuing. The distances over which animals are transported are growing. Monitoring animal transports from space by satellite positioning may be a very interesting technology, but it is just one method of surveillance, of which in my view we have too many. The effectiveness of all methods should be looked at again. This report ought to be promoting regional business cycles. That is why I can and must say that it needs to be completely revised to that effect.

 Mr President, underlying the whole report is the fundamental idea that people in the European Community – and in all its regions, widely divergent in their structure though they are – have a job and hence an entitlement to an income commensurate with what they produce. If I am right in my understanding of what the rapporteur said, then it is only if that is the case that one can talk of there being such a thing as social European Union. The report rightly points out that yields vary widely across the European Union, even though Europe’s climate and other natural conditions are favourable to almost all crops. The principal causes of the changes in costs over recent years are well-known. My expectation of future reforms is that the Commission will take more account of their ability to influence the cost structure. I also expect openings to be created for more investments, and I hope that a greater diversity of programmes will result in simplification and clarity of vision. As in other reports, reference is made to the fact that direct payments to farmers, being factored in as sources of income, cannot simply be cut out without the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs, and I believe, with regret, that there are those who want that to happen. More and more people in Europe’s rural areas are doing more than one job, and so every euro that is not spent on structural planning and development in rural areas – I am talking in terms of billions – is always associated with the loss of income and jobs. This makes it important to assess whether the work and the way the European agricultural model is applied tend towards appropriate rewards for European farmers, and what is meant by that. About this, the rapporteur is rather reticent, the reason being that there is a lack of data. My expectation, though, is that, as the market organisation develops further, we will be able to answer the question of what an appropriate income for farmers actually is. In Germany, farmers’ incomes have dropped dramatically, by 6.1% and 19.8% in the last two financial years. That amounts to an overall economic crash. This bleak state of affairs has come about for two reasons; one is flooding and drought, but – as has already been said in this debate – it has far more to do with the price war in food retailing, in which farmers are generally on the losing side. How are the location of production, and hence employment and income, affected by the decoupling of payments and their being linked to environmental requirements – an attempt at riding two horses, in giving the market a greater role in determining farmers’ incomes while rewarding with public funds services that are no longer in demand? Will it ensure extensive agricultural land use? Far from it; it is far more to be feared that it will lead to the onset of predatory competition and that we will be facing structural changes that will leave local areas worse off. That is something I do not want.

 Mr President, this own-initiative report on agriculture and agricultural research has my full support. I too take the view that the right approach has been adopted by addressing future-oriented issues on the basis of an analysis which preceded this own-initiative report. I hope, of course, as previous speakers have already said, that the Commission will draw the right conclusions, for the CAP reform in particular has brought about a paradigm shift in European agriculture and I hope that scientific monitoring will be effective here in future too. I think it is right, and would like to reiterate here, that the budget for the next framework programme has been set on the basis of proposed projects. I am unsure how the 2% is arrived at, but I think it probably conceals projects as well. In the settlement of the current programme, it will be very interesting to see exactly what has happened. Agricultural research is generally multiannual, and I have been told about projects undertaken within this multiannual research framework that have never entered their final phase due to budget cutbacks. The Member States are also very keen on cutting research funding. Yet any research that does not produce results is a waste of resources. In the previous debate, complex issues relating to more intensive research into income and income generation options were discussed in more detail. It will be very interesting to see how this will look in future, who will be dealing with it, and in which areas, under which conditions and with which assumptions. I too agree that the complex research areas of food and food safety must be addressed in particular. Everything else, however, has been set out so comprehensively in the report that it requires no further comment from me.

 Mr President, today’s debate on the second reading of the sweeteners directive typifies a development that I regard with increasing disquiet and grave concern. The Commission justifies change in terms of the state of the art in technology and science. I too am in favour of scientific progress, but not everything that appears to be an improvement is actually in the consumer’s best interests. I ask myself what will be the end result when the food industry produces food by refining, to a high level, animal and vegetable raw materials and by the use of thousands of synthetic flavourings, and is able to take these processes almost to extremes. Our daily food intake is being taken over by pharmacists, chemists and genetic engineers. Whilst I cannot and will not put up with this situation, it is evident that someone is making money out of it, and it is for precisely that reason, and in the interests of public health, that it is an absolute necessity that food directives should rest on a scientific basis. The assessment of risks is, however, being made ever more complex and problematic by increases in the depth of processing and in the diversity of the procedures and additives used, while, at the same time, legislation becomes out of date more quickly. Turning specifically to the subject of the recommendation adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, there are two comments I would like to make. I endorse Amendment No 1a to the effect that all sweeteners should be re-evaluated within as short a time as possible before the directive enters into force. My reasoning is that I believe that the warning by sceptical scientists associating aspartame with tumours cannot simply be dismissed, the all-clear sounded by the official scientific committee on food notwithstanding. Whilst I have every confidence in the choices scientists make, I do take the view that the specifics of threshold values have to be handled with care and on a methodologically justified basis. I endorse Amendment No 3 because setting a definite deadline for the distribution of stocks of products that are no longer permitted can prevent these products from being got over the counter quickly.

 In July and August, extremes of heat, drought and forest fires inflicted great suffering on European citizens. The forest fires, in particular, caused severe damage; human lives were lost, and the destruction of flora and fauna is harming the ecosystem. The rebuilding of the homes, factories and infrastructure that have been destroyed in the affected areas will take years, and people will not be able to accomplish it on their own. Dealing with the damage will require the creation of a whole network of relief agencies, and the people affected are in urgent need of solidarity, from the European Community in particular. I therefore welcome the allocation of aid totalling EUR 31.6 million for the people severely affected as being the EU’s first significant response, but we should assume even now that financial support will need to be improved – to what extent, it goes without saying, will be able to be determined only after the full extent of the damage has been precisely ascertained. It is, at the same time, indispensable that we ensure that it is possible to get the long-term help needed to rebuild the social and economic fabric started promptly and without bureaucracy. Also, for the sake of protecting the forests in future, steps must be taken to improve meteorological forecasts, thus making it possible to minimise the risks associated with adverse weather conditions.

 Mr President, the requirements for agriculture to become environmentally-friendly and species-friendly are a matter of general knowledge; implementing them demands that we convert to methods of cultivation, rearing and feeding that are as close to nature as possible. In this chain, the food market is vigorously contended for, and distorted, by businesses operating on a national and international scale. That has an effect on almost all feed proteins and on additives. What happens to a farmer at the feed market is exactly the same as what happens to the consumer at the meat counter. Both have to be able to rely on what is inside the pack of meat, or the sack of feed, being what it says on the outside. It is, unfortunately, not yet universally known that what you feed to animals you end up feeding to humans. That is what makes the forthcoming general overhaul of the densely entangled European legislation in this area not only absolutely necessary but also, I think, overdue, even though, when it comes to additives to feedingstuffs, it is important to consider not only the effect of appetite stimulants or of growth promoters on the animals and hence on the farm’s viability, but also the complex side-effects of such substances. Any risk of detriment to human health or to the environment must be excluded as far as possible. Only thus will it be possible to regain the consumers’ confidence in the safety of foodstuffs of animal origin, a confidence shattered by the events associated with BSE, dioxin and antibiotics. It is that with which this regulation concerns itself, as does the committee’s position, which I endorse. Even though voices are raised to assert that the large-scale banning of antibiotics from the feeding-trough is excessive, since some 90% of antibiotics are used in human and veterinary medicine, it is right that we should put a stop to growth promotion, as these antibiotics are far from being essential. We already have enough problems with the increasing number of people developing resistance to antibiotics. I too have some criticisms to make at this point. On 7 March this year I submitted a written question to the Council on the banning of the additive Nifursol. To this day, I have received no reply, even though Parliament’s administration has pressed for one on two occasions. Nifursol, an aromatic nitrogen compound, was the last remaining prophylactic agent against blackhead disease in turkeys, and it appears that no medication is now licensed for the treatment of this disease. There are no alternatives, and there is no prospect of a vaccine. The reason why Nifursol was banned was that the EU classed it as carcinogenic. According to interim findings published by the Austrian health ministry on 16 June, no harmful residues have been found to date as a result of the testing of turkeys from food markets. If that result is confirmed, then prohibitions to protect human health may no longer be proportionate even under the broad terms of the European Court of Justice’s ruling of 11 September 2002. The ban on Nifursol may end up being re-examined. Feedingstuffs that are guaranteed to be safe, as well as transparency in the production of food, demand that policy decisions be justified by science and taken on the basis of findings; they should not be rushed through in response to suspicions. For me, as a matter of principle, farmers must be at the centre of these decisions rather than on their margins!

Mr President, the rapporteurs and members of the Committee on Agricultural and Rural Development have had a hard job positively revising the Commission proposals for reform of the Agricultural Policy, which are ill thought-out and unreasonable. I refer specifically to complex cereals, dried fodder, milk, and also to reductions in defence of the gradual decrease and the full decoupling of direct payments. Particularly in respect of enlargement, it is a positive thing that the majority of the committee are behind my proposal to allow, with regard to rye, a time-limited intervention for locations where there is no alternative to its cultivation. All in all, however, I am dissatisfied, in particular as the pressure of time was so great that the assembly-line voting did not produce a conclusive result. Furthermore, I consider it wrong in principle that the majority show such unwavering solidarity with the Commission on the road to decoupling and total liberalisation. I want to state clearly that, for me, the issue is not about a primitive autarky, but an agricultural policy whose priority is orientation towards the internal market offering ever greater opportunities for regularisation. Exports should be limited to finished agricultural products and imports subject to special external protection which does not hinder developing countries, and at the same time does not prevent access to the market for cheap goods from large non-multifunctional agricultural export countries, such as the USA and the Cairns Group. Without these conditions there can be no sustained universal multifunctional agriculture in the European Union. We should all be clear about this. In conclusion I would like to mention two further important reasons for rejecting the Cunha report. Firstly I am opposed to modulation funds being a sort of second Cohesion Fund. These funds should be used in the interests of rural development in each Member State. Secondly I consider it wrong that decoupling is being prematurely implemented. It is therefore obvious that a regionalised land premium is far more progressive. The proposal from Mr Cunha, however, will be almost impossible to carry through.

 Mr President, the history of foot and mouth disease in Europe can be traced back over many years, but the great catastrophe began in the South of England on 21 February 2001. Although it had been known for decades what damage could be caused by the uncontrolled outbreak of a disease, the opportunity for effective defence against the epidemic was not taken. The courses of action set in motion in the Member States affected were unable to prevent the spread of the virus. The state of emergency that was then announced in various regions of the EU left both the rural and urban public equally enraged. Rural areas began to resemble high-security blocks, and a sort of state of emergency was the order of the day on the farms that had been affected. At this time, there was no shortage of ideas as to who was to blame. The EU’s ban on vaccination, which adhered to the principle that, if even only one animal was vaccinated, the whole country was declared to be infected with FMD, met with little approval on the part of the public, and even well-informed officials demanded at the time the use of what are termed marker vaccines in order to prevent the disease from becoming more widespread. Many members of the public saw the containment of foot and mouth disease by means of the open burning of animal cadavers as demonstrating complete disregard for animals’ dignity, and nor did the bottom line add up in economic terms. By doing justice to this principle, the report on the control of foot and mouth disease draws the right conclusions from the calamity of 2001, and has, moreover, been able to confirm the results produced by the work of the committee of investigation. This is an encouragement to the same course of action in other cases, such as that of fowlpest, a constantly-recurrent disease that spreads from one country to its neighbours, one of the main problems with which is the large number of contacts across frontiers. Then – if you go by what the press says – there is the great danger of fowlpest, like foot and mouth disease, becoming even worse than a worst-case scenario. The principle of ‘killing rather than vaccination’ or rather its opposite, should, in the EU, apply to all animal species. It would be worth Parliament’s time and effort to investigate that more closely, examining, for example, whether the German ordinance to prevent the spreading of classic fowlpest is in line with what is actually known and whether all species should be included in the text. It would also be possible to re-examine how cross-border cooperation is actually organised. As far as FMD is concerned, all is quiet in the candidate countries, but I would like to take this opportunity to observe that this state of affairs can change rapidly. Any and every misjudgment in the area of controlling zoonoses and the early diagnosis of them has economic and social consequences. The report was quite right in stating what had to be done, and the work has been a support. I endorse the report and the proposals it makes; above all, I endorse those amendments that have to do with the protection of the fundamental right to property, and which lead the report to emphatically hold fast to some sort of compensation arrangement for those affected. I also endorse those amendments that seek to increase the freedom of action of veterinarians and the steering bodies in the Member States. In so far as the Member States’ responsibilities will change at all, they will increase, as the decision as to which epidemic strategy is to be applied, and when, is to become a matter for the country in question, and rightly so. This does not discharge those who keep animals from their obligation of cleanliness and good order. Criminal activity in border areas involving the trade in animals belongs in another law, but the report sets out the right approach to this, too.

 Mr President, quality assurance in food production poses major challenges to all those involved in the production chain. One of the tasks is to utilise those resources which safeguard transparency and traceability for all market participants, and, of course, for consumers. Seed production is a broad-based business; marketing is regulated in the various countries by official supervisory authorities, and the factors such as varietal purity and certification of origin are confirmed. This report is intended to close the gaps. To this end, financial support in the sum of EUR 1 million is available, but as I have already said, this is a broad-based business. The provision of EUR 1 million illustrates, to my mind, how long it will take to be able to carry out comparative tests in this area. Labelling has always been required for the genetically modified varieties, and it is a matter for the countries themselves to deal with the thresholds. The problem of multiplication of sowing seed on individual farms, which is addressed here, will and should be regulated flexibly through special replicate licences, a solution which I can only endorse. Here, there have been – and continue to be – substantial gaps. The EU should deal comprehensively with the entire complex issue of GMOs within the framework of the Life Sciences and Biotechnology Action Plan, also as regards seed. I wish to call, at this point, for competition law and competitive freedom of choice to be maintained, not restricted, in agricultural production. This report does not do so, but I would like to highlight this issue once again.

 Mr President, this report from the Commission backs sustainability throughout the economy, which primarily means reducing the consumption of resources and using progressive standards to put a stop as soon as possible to economic activities that harm the environment. If we are to do this, we must remove the barriers we ourselves have erected, which, in environmental policy, are mainly to be found at the level of the nation state. That agriculture's core activity is the production of healthy, safe and high-quality food is not a matter of dispute, but despite that – or indeed because of it – we have to be able to say that there is little disagreement among farmers that, in the interests of viable food production, plant protection agents should be applied to cultivated plants in order to avoid the reduction of yield or quality as a result of disease, pests and weeds. The public associate the word ‘pesticide’ with poisons in the soil, plants and food; for many of them, who are at odds with farmers, it has become a rallying cry, but the reality is quite different. Without plant protection agents, the cultivation of fruit and vegetables and the production of wine are not manageable, so the only thing to do is to use the minimum of chemical agents to protect the plants from pathogens, pests and weed invasion while at the same time applying more powerful biological and mechanical alternatives. I see it as a key component of a sustainable plant protection strategy that integrated cultivation should become the normal mode of production in society. This will minimise the adverse effects of plant protection agents right across the countryside. However, an ecological rural economy will not enable this objective to be as generally achieved as it has to be. To say that is to state a sober fact and is no denial of the need to support the ecological rural economy. There are certain specific things that I regard as necessary and deserving of support. Harmonisation of maximum residue levels in food derived from plants across the EU is indispensable in order to protect consumers in the EU's internal market. What is no less necessary is harmonised licensing of plant protection agents. The mutual recognition principle must be allowed in each Member State until such time as that is accomplished. That is what the promotion of equal opportunities in competition requires. With the present problems in fruit-growing and horticulture in mind, I urge that, before the substitution principle is introduced, the effects of the reduction in the agents permitted in the EU – from over 800 to some 300 by the end of 2000 – should be analysed. Existing notification procedures have not been laid down for anything like a sufficient period of time. As a result, we end up with restrictions, application provisions with time limits, or debt, the worst alternative solution, which is no sort of solution at all. Under the current scheme of things, manufacturers of plant protection agents are required to guarantee that their products meet the prescribed safety standards. Public scandals demonstrate the failure to consistently regulate these procedures. I am convinced that serious and genuine solutions will be achieved only when an obligation to label requires that the manufacturers of precursors give end users all the information that they need.

 Mr President, any decisions taken with regard to consumer protection must pay due attention to the expectations and hopes, and also the fears, of the 425 million consumers in the enlarged Union. In its legislative acts, Parliament has the duty of taking the complexities and future effects of consumer protection into account, as well as the risks associated with it. The reports on the future of European consumer protection policy meet this demand whilst also demanding that an end be put to the lack of discipline in relations with consumers. Many people see the provisions in the areas of food safety, services, health and safety as having already lost their moral innocence in the face of market developments. There is a great need for action, for example, in order to put a stop to abuses in the area of telecommunications and for reforms in competition law and in the field of financial services to protect consumers. Giving life to the right of initiative for the consumers' benefit demands that a permanent place be found for consumer protection in the public advice and consultation system, as well as education and, above all, more information. Consumer protection has to protect people against fraud, health hazards, and financial loss. The principle of effectiveness applies to consumer protection as much as it does to anything else, but there must be no gain in efficiency to the detriment or disadvantage of consumers. I therefore endorse the demand that complete harmonisation of the legal provisions be restricted to what are manifestly special cases, subject, however, to the condition that this principle is not misused and that minimum standards will be deregulated.

 Mr President, the Commission has emphasised in its communication that enlargement of the European Union will be the core challenge of 2004. Whilst the importance of this issue is not to be denied, I do, however, have my doubts as to whether these Budget lines will actually enable the Commission to handle these challenges. My real concern is with the fact that, in connection with enlargement, provision has been made for expenditure of some EUR 11 billion in 2004, which amounts to only 10% of the total commitment appropriations. In agricultural expenditure, the proportion is as low as 2.4%. These proportions are hardly likely to guarantee the Member States participation on an equal basis, even when it is borne in mind that accession will happen as late as 1 May, so what I expect of the Commission is that they should set out in detail in the preliminary draft Budget what legal entitlements the new Member States will have to participation in all programmes funded from the EU Budget. Funds for the structural measures are very extensive – for this too, sensible advance plans were made in former years – but what is not working is the outflow of resources. What I expect is that the Commission will not delay long in producing precise figures and an analysis of why this is so and of the obstructions involved. There is a need here for greater confidence in the system's fairness, for not one euro of structural support funding must be wasted. For many citizens in the European Union's regions, the projects that depend on such funds are often the last fragile hope for the maintenance of their jobs. Now, today, the starting pistol has been fired, and the process of drawing up the preliminary draft of the 2004 general Budget can begin; there are important debates before us, and important work remains to be done. I therefore expect absolute transparency of the whole procedure, coupled with wide-ranging public relations work, which cannot fail to improve the public's perception of the European Union.

 Mr President, on 27 January, the Commission stated that the EU's proposal on the WTO negotiations was compatible with our current advocacy of substantial and progressive liberalisation on a fair and even-handed basis. It is furthermore stated in clear terms that ‘the actual measures involve the fair sharing of agricultural burdens and the developing countries, too, should be given greater opportunities.’ That is a logical development in view of the fact that, in the EU too since the 1992 CAP reform, liberalisation keeps making advances in the implementation of the GATT resolutions. The good ship WTO is steaming ahead, with undertakings in the agricultural and food industries swimming in its wake as best they can, as, every time the consumer spends a euro on groceries, the farmers get only an average of 25 cents. The liberalisation of agricultural trade has its advocates and its opponents. There is unanimous agreement that developing countries should be given easier access to the European Internal Market, yet, despite liberalisation – or, indeed, as a consequence of it – there has been no definite improvement in the situation as regards world hunger; indeed, as the motions for a resolution point out, this has got worse. It is not clear what sort of permanent and comprehensive body of Europe-wide legislation on non-commercial matters might be able to maintain the balancing act between, on the one hand, the maintenance and improvement of European agriculture's competitive position on world markets and, on the other hand, the protection of insufficiently competitive agriculture at a time when it is being made more multifunctional for the benefit of society. My mind is quite open as to whether the European agricultural model, combining multifunctionality with a policy of subsidies, can be implemented with any international legitimacy. The great danger is already present that this will prove no long-lasting protection and that the abandonment of European subsidy policy will then begin in earnest, because there will as yet be no political majorities, and where they do exist, they will be compromises. On the other hand, the WTO's fundamental categories do not include issues of rural development, environmental protection and animal welfare. What is true of enlargement must also be true of the WTO negotiations, the principle being that nobody should be any worse off. The situation before the negotiations and after them will be considered in that light, so we can look forward to the result with some excitement.

 Mr President, as a member of the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease, I have a very high opinion of its final report, which Parliament is to discuss today. The rapporteur's drafting has made the final report fair and a polished piece of work. The advice given by experts to the many hearings was characterised by a consensus that the progress of this disease was to be resisted. Taking into consideration the fact that foot and mouth disease is present all over the world, continuing globalisation and deregulation, that is to say, the increase in worldwide trade, which is already very extensive, and in passenger traffic, mean that the European Union has to reckon with a growing danger of foot and mouth disease being introduced from infected areas. Whereas, formerly, three types of FMD were present across Europe, and successfully combated by means of ring-vaccination, Europe now faces the danger of the disease being imported from a wide variety of sources. The problem here is that – much as with influenza – vaccination only works if the vaccination is derived largely from the same strain as the disease. There is little point in prophylactic vaccination against virus strains, as it is impossible to know in advance which actual FMD virus is being brought in. What does make sense, on the contrary, is what is advocated in the report – the carrying-out of emergency vaccination in the event of an epidemic, which of course presupposes that it is possible to ascertain rapidly the actual strain of the disease involved. This position is a controversial one, but, in the absence of effective action against epidemics in the areas from which they come, and given the current state of research, I can see no alternative and no other option. I would emphasise that emergency vaccination is meant to help prevent foot and mouth disease from spreading. It is for that reason that my group has tabled a motion to the effect that a worldwide strategy to combat foot and mouth disease should be worked out among the FAO countries. What we demand of a policy came to us loud and clear in the many conversations we had with cattle farmers, with representatives of local authorities and associations, and with members of the public who were deeply unsettled and, in ethical terms, outraged. Associated with this is the necessity of using suitable measures to at last halt the burgeoning live animal transports across Europe. This is far from being only an animal protection issue; it is about preventing diseases. There are circumstances under which the Community must involve itself in national preventive strategies, as each EU country belongs to the common internal market and can maintain important relationships with third countries. All the Member States must be able to call upon the services of adequately qualified veterinary personnel in the prevention and treatment of animal diseases. Further scientific investigation is needed into issues associated with emergency vaccination against FMD and the continued use of inoculated animals. It is not possible to justify sending ten million animals to what is, at the end of the day, a senseless death, if ethically and economically preferable procedures are in the offing. My fifth point is that I expect the Commission to come up with proposals for better legal protection for the affected parties in order to compensate for the great financial losses and resultant damage in the regions. In conclusion, I would like to say that I would like great public awareness of the review of the common agricultural policy, and not only in the most arduous, and bleakest, times of crisis.

 – Mr President, the reform process set in motion by the 1992 agricultural reform and continued by Agenda 2000 is to be carried forward and adjusted to reflect changing circumstances. The Commission's proposals are a basis for discussions after 2007, as a whole raft of issues and problems correctly identified in the paper remain to be resolved. Nevertheless, the common agricultural policy was successful, and those elements that made it successful still need to be defended. I am quite convinced that there will be major debates on the decisions reached by the Heads of State and Government in Brussels as regards how to deal with future expenditure under EU agricultural policy within the predetermined financial framework and including the ten candidate countries. Looked at in that light, the motion for a resolution is just a snapshot and not a reform paper. Freezing the agriculture budget at its 2006 level as from 2007 means an annual cut in agricultural support for farmers in the existing Member States, which will be hard or even impossible to achieve in 2003, the year before the elections. It will not be possible to reach a consensus to the effect that farmers should meet the cost of enlargement, yet it looks suspiciously as if that is what is intended. In her speech, the President-in-Office mentioned that there are proposals on the table for the milk sector. I would like to ask you, Madam President-in-Office, when you think these proposals will be implemented. Before 2008 or not?

 Mr President, in March 2002 the European Parliament adopted a resolution on guidelines for the 2003 Budget. A series of issues were mentioned that are of the utmost significance for the future viability of our policies on agriculture and rural development. These include the mid-term review of Agenda 2000, consumer protection and enlargement. I hope that the Commission is sufficiently courageous and competent also to take account of these long-term objectives when it is implementing the budget and that it will not be distracted by more immediate political concerns. I hope that sources of conflict, such as shortcomings in accounting procedures, fiddling and cooking of the books, are eliminated and that instead transparency and strict discipline are the order of the day when the budget is implemented. Both nationally and internationally, interested members of the public are presented with a confused and contradictory picture of agricultural policy. As they currently stand, Commissioner Fischler's proposals have not met with the approval of a majority. More work therefore needs to be done on them. Despite the fact that the applicant countries have made huge economic and social adjustments, the Berlin decisions provide that the funds to be transferred to the accession countries, in the form of pre-accession aid, and expenditure on enlargement are to be maintained as laid down and made public. Several discussions in which I have participated have reinforced my view, in favour of the applicant countries, that the 25% rule for direct payments is politically unacceptable; in addition the applicant countries fear high losses and are demanding an accession rebate and a change in their quotas. This will have a major impact on the funding of the agricultural policy and the current financial perspective will have to be revised. How much will enlargement cost? That is the question. How we are to respond to this in the 2003 Budget remains unknown. A vital question for the agricultural sector is 1.05% + X and for as long as it remains unanswered the implementation of the 2003 Budget will remain a dangerous business as far as agriculture is concerned.

The dismantling of agricultural export incentives and barriers to food exports from developing countries mean that the countries in the south can take their rightful place in world trade. However, the interplay between trade, environmental pollution and development which results from EU agricultural policy is often overestimated. Disturbances on agricultural markets affect few products and should therefore be examined for any effect on lasting development. We need to act by pushing ahead on so-called non-trade related concerns during WTO negotiations. The WTO should stop evading the issues of consumer protection, the environment and animal protection standards. This includes implementing the development work of the 15 EU Member States, as formulated on more than one occasion. The decisions taken in Doha (on trade) and Monterrey (on finance) should be examined in detail immediately.

 Mr President, whilst the Budget Memorandum for 2003 still leaves many questions open, the economic situation in 2002 is becoming clearer and it is easier to get an overall view of it. I believe that it is not only in Germany that the goal of stabilising euroland by not exceeding a public debt of 3% of gross domestic product is in danger of being missed. The absence of 2%-3% annual economic growth means that grossly excessive unemployment figures can no longer be artificially covered up. This makes it all the more understandable that the backlog of Structural Funds is being treated as if the funds were not there. The prospect of actually successfully solving the problem of mass unemployment in the coming fourth quarter is made fainter by mounting indirect labour costs and the failure of the European Union, among others, to solve the problems caused by distortions of competition. I also believe that the days of public jubilation at the freedom apparently won through globalisation are over. The 2003 budget will instead be measured against the yardstick of seriousness, transparency and honesty. I can recall that Parliament was always more than merely critical of the annual accumulation of financial resources from the Structural Funds. What is decisive for the public's sense of belonging is what goes down well with them. The Commission's non-existent policy on non-existent Structural Funds does little to promote a feeling of belonging on the part of the European Union's citizens. The winter months are going to be the most difficult in economic terms for a long time. The many pledges made in the wake of the flood disaster must at last be worked off at a more rapid pace. If they are not, there is a growing danger of those aspects of land use for which we have already accorded financial assistance from the sources available triggering substantial conflicts between business, transport, housing, leisure and tourism at the various structural levels. The situation is grave, and I assume that it is known that the public are seeing the gap between income and expenditure narrowing still further. They need the money that is kept in Brussels.

Mr President, there is no doubt that there are a great many weaknesses in our food controls, and food safety is an unacceptably low priority. The revision of the directive on food may help to significantly change this situation. This is particularly necessary given the growing worldwide trend towards producing food by artificial means. There are at present no universal controls on the value-added chain, and awareness of state food controls needs to be increased. There will certainly be an improvement in this state of affairs if we can succeed in involving the agricultural industry, the animal feed industry and those engaged in the monitoring of food. That will not be a simple task as those in positions of responsibility throughout the chain have a very negative attitude. State controls are necessary, but we need to create better incentives for promoting voluntary self-regulation and self-regulation under civil law. State controls can then focus on the high-risk companies and farms that will always exist. It is not acceptable, when products have been placed on the market contrary to health regulations, for this to be declared the result of a production accident and the products withdrawn under covert or open buy-back schemes so that they will simply be forgotten. As we know from past experience, it tends to be very difficult to clarify the facts of such cases rapidly and rigorously. Compulsory reporting of what are labelled as serious health risks is clearly not enough. In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania 320 farms were temporarily closed because of suspected contamination with Nitrofen, but the discovery of this scandal and the attendant publicity were remarkable not so much because of the number of cases as because of the nature of the crisis.

 Mr President, the most disastrous floods in living memory to strike those who live on the Elbe and on some of its tributaries have also had a grave effect on farmers and their businesses. Although there is as yet no definite account of the damage, provisional reports from the Federal States of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, which have been particularly affected, give some indication of the colossal extent of the flood damage, the present position being that the damage done by floodwater to agriculture and forestry amounts to around EUR 287 million. In Saxony alone, some 1 900 farms have been directly affected by floodwater, and another 640 in Saxony-Anhalt. Far greater, though, is the damage done to residential property in the villages, to the infrastructure of rural areas and to the dikes on the rivers. My home area, Prignitz, lies right on the Elbe, and damage there has been great; even though it was possible to prevent disaster itself in the form of flooding or the breaching of the dikes on the Elbe, the inhabitants of thirty-eight Prignitz villages had to be evacuated, with some 20 000 head of cattle being rescued from the flooding – a massive achievement for neighbourly aid in the sparsely-inhabited Prignitz. A massive amount of work was done in Havelland, where many thousands of helpers did their best to counteract the artificial flooding of Havelland even though the polder dikes had been burst. The environmental and financial effects will become apparent only in late 2003 and 2004. It is my express demand that the advance payment of the EU's 50% per-hectare premium be proceeded with speedily, but I do ask Commissioner Fischler to review its payment to businesses, even though this is not within his remit. The application forms that have come into my possession are drafted in the language of bureaucracy rather than that of solidarity. There is, then, a need for additional money. Special credit facilities and guarantee programmes may well be helpful, but many farmers no longer have it in them to get into debt again, as these programmes all have the characteristic that they become effective after a time delay. We know that this year, EUR 1 to 1.3 billion of the EU's budget will be left unused. I ask as a matter of urgency that consideration be given to the possibility of the unused funds being used as non-repayable subsidies to benefit the farmers in all the affected areas which have suffered severe damage, rather than being repaid to the Member States. When the EU implements its measures, it is subjected to intense scrutiny by its citizens. What is needed, and in short order, is money, not sleight of hand or political evasive action. With that in mind, I hope Parliament, and all of us, will be able to do the right thing.

Mr President, the traceability of foods from the field to the supermarket shelf is a must. At the same time, there must be a voluntary quality assurance procedure for producers, which offers our millions of consumers high safety standards. Unfortunately, the procedure used in the Member States is too disparate and too unclear. Without strict controls there will be no way of preventing all forms of abusive labelling. Consumers want natural foods and are against the use of any technology in the production of food. Labelling and traceability do not automatically guarantee safety. The greatest danger lies in the procedure for licensing genetically modified organisms in the food chain in the Community, if this contradicts the general product standards laid down in WTO rules. The Commission's plans for reforming the CAP are proliferating daily. The planned amendments are a challenge to the Member States' right of codetermination and to their interest groups. And farming is being turned into a sort of employment agency, with administration and control systems gaining in importance over good, professional practice. The new size reductions required are yet another political blunder and are therefore unacceptable. This report looks a long way into the future and so should a reform.
Fiebiger (GUE/NGL

 – (DE)
 Madam President, it was decided in Nice that accession negotiations must be completed by the end of the year so that, if required, the necessary codetermination rights can be exercised in the national parliaments in the course of 2003. In the complex documentation accompanying accession negotiations, the chapters on agriculture, finance and regional policy in particular have attracted a lot of public interest. People – by which I mean explicitly the citizens of the EU – are paying more attention to these things than ever before. At this point I would like to ask the Commission to give the Info-Points Europe,
 where they exist, more money so they can perform their current tasks. The present proposal to phase in direct aids to farmers by 2013 cannot be the last word. This model is not convincing because it lacks sufficient justification. The European reference yield, only 2.96 in Poland’s case for example, used as the basis for payment of direct aid is more than just an ugly detail. That is not the way to encourage viability and sustainability of agriculture in the candidate countries. My group believes that European agricultural policy cannot operate two policies in the long term. My group also wants to see the candidate countries’ integration into the common agricultural policy organised in tune with those countries’ specific macroeconomic trends with special attention paid to social needs. EU enlargement can be achieved only by the EU, the Member States and their regions working together. Development of the border regions is particularly important here. All involved must intensify their efforts, but they need the close attention of the European Union and the nation states. The current programme of economic development for the border regions, amounting to EUR 245 million, is not enough. Its availability is tied to other flows into and out of the regions, placing an even greater burden on already weak local authorities. But the EU budget is not under such pressure. If the Council Presidency under Spanish Chairmanship is unable to agree a final figure for direct agricultural aids – because of impending elections as, alas, in Germany – then the last few months will be spent trying to catch up, and in my opinion there will only be losers.
Fiebiger (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, both reports and most of the amendments are based on a political will to carry the Berlin decisions forward and to shape the enlargement of the Community on the basis of this European agricultural model. The main issue is to maintain payments under the common market organisation, with quantity regulation needing to be achieved, as planned, by means of financial compensation. This long-term approach has been one of the main pillars of the success of the common agricultural policy and it should not be underestimated. It is certainly appropriate to increase competitivity at national level by means of cooperation models for developing rural areas as an economic factor in professional farming. This presupposes high-quality production and a high degree of ecologically sound farming. The main substance of both reports is that the multifunctionality of the European agricultural model needs to be secured in the long term. Moving away from this model would mean standing still with regard to an approach that our citizens in the regions have only just begun to adopt. What is lacking is a broad social debate about whether the risks of multifunctionality can be accepted. I think they can. In conclusion, I would like to say that I am against any economies of scale. This is not something that the European agricultural model has called for up to now, and that is a testament to the common agricultural policy's scope for development and general possibilities.
Fiebiger (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, I believe that the proposal we have before us for a Council regulation in which animal-health rules are to be made more transparent and the existing directives brought together in a single text represents a further step towards simplifying agriculture policy in this area and above all towards creating a legal basis for controls on various activities. I certainly hope it will work out that way. However, I would also like to make a special plea for scientific research into products of animal origin to be continued on living animals in the case of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease for example, and that this should then be applied in an affordable way. High new technical and organisational standards need to be practical, and by that I also mean affordable. I also particularly have in mind food imports from third countries. At the same time – and I am just finishing now – we need to provide sufficiently serious support for the many consumer protection organisations.

The resolution adopted by Parliament today is a step in the right direction, and we emphatically welcome it, for there is no reasonable alternative to a political solution, and the Sharon Government's present bellicose response to the terrorist attacks by Palestinian fanatics, which are contemptuous of human life, is no longer acceptable. As the resolution expressly states, Israel's military escalation offends against international law and human rights. In no way does it contribute to ending the terror, but is, rather, directed against the Palestinian civilian population and is destroying the Palestinian infrastructure. We emphatically endorse Parliament's call for the immediate implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions 1397, 1402 and 1403, and especially for the immediate withdrawal of the Israeli army from Palestinian territory 
as well as for the condemnation of the attacks against Israel by suicidal terrorists. To place Arafat, a democratically elected president, under house arrest is wholly unacceptable. We firmly welcome Parliament's expression of support for an arms embargo on Palestine and Israel, as well as its call for the Council and the Commission to consider suspending the Association Agreement between Israel and the European Union. It is, moreover, significant that Parliament is demanding free access for the media to the occupied territories and expressing its full support for Israeli, Palestinian and international organisations that are actively working for the restoration of peace in the Middle East. We unreservedly support the condemnation in Parliament's resolution of the many anti-Semitic attacks in Europe on synagogues, Jewish schools and cemeteries.

Mr President, obtaining food supplements as health products from the Internet is not encouraged by this report. I well understand the life stories of the individuals who are concerned by this directive, but my own experiences tell me something different. In my opinion, substances that are used to treat and alleviate the symptoms of serious illnesses, of illnesses that may not yet be curable at the present time, should be covered by legislation on medicinal products and have nothing to do with the consumption of foodstuffs. In other words, products with pharmaceutical ingredients which are advertised as possessing medicinal powers must be subject to licensing as medicinal products. The aim of the directive is to harmonise maximum permissible quantities of active ingredients throughout the 15 Member States and to improve national conditions on the basis of criteria relating to the harmlessness of products to human health as a preventive measure of consumer protection. The national food and pharmaceuticals industries are vying for an extremely lucrative market in foodstuffs enriched with active ingredients. A new type of food product is being advertised here, and the advertisements often focus on additional health- and performance-enhancing qualities, sometimes proven but often imputed, of these products. I believe that it is important and that it befits our responsibility to ensure that the line between medicinal and food products does not become blurred or negotiable. In this expanding market, the pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs industries will move heaven and earth to enrich food products with additives which are not naturally found in those products. The report is based on transparency, disclosure and safety for consumers. For this reason I support it. The directive will never absolve patients and consumers, however, from the imperative obligation to read the small print: ‘If in doubt, please consult your doctor or pharmacist’. This is why scientists and researchers have a legal entitlement to improve this common position.

Madam President, infringements of the fundamental principles of food standards law provide a great deal of headline material in many, if not all, of the countries of the European Union. Although they involved a lot of distortion and scaremongering, reports played a significant role in preventing such occurrences from being forgotten. The breaches in the investigation of BSE which have become public knowledge in recent days represent setbacks for all those who have campaigned to introduce a high level of consumer health protection in food production, and I think they had had some of those already. It is precisely the great public interest in this subject, and the apparent avoidability of the most recent instances of human health being put in danger, that justifies the introduction of strict sanctions as asked for by the report, in order to finally stop new cases of BSE flaring up. The highest standards in food production should apply in the European Union. Such is the most significant statement in the White Paper on Food Safety. The legal framework this requires must, as I understand things, be allied to a recognised early warning system through the EU countries, so that suspicion that human health has been endangered will result in the products being designated and their manufacturers named in public. As a rule, public warnings are always desirable, above all when it is suspected that a product has been widely distributed, which is always the likely case in the never-ending cycle of food production. It makes sense to me that specific food producers should be publicly named and warned where, in future, there is the mere suspicion of danger through unhygienic production practices or basic materials. The widely-honoured principle is this: checks on animal feed are the preliminary stages of foodstuffs inspection. The report's demands are indeed far-reaching. Practical experience will show whether breach of a specific duty by the withholding of information should have the same consequence as fraud against the financial interest of the European Community. The whole importance of the report lies in the necessity of referring again and again to the need to abide by existing prohibitions and instructions. I wish to observe in conclusion that Mr Olsson's report is of contemporary relevance and shows close acquaintance with the present situation. I do not believe that it is a plan of campaign for the next BSE crisis.

Mr President, from Brussels’ point of view, the budget for 2002 is coherent and comprehensive, despite the criticisms made by the European Court of Auditors, which I have been examining with great interest. The Berlin decisions still offer some scope, particularly since there is apparently no need to maintain the levy on the Member States at its present level. In the implementation of the budget for 2002, I expect the structural support funds for the development of rural areas to be spent in full and all surplus revenue to be reduced to zero before or during the year 2006 if possible, by ensuring that eligible projects are realised within the shortest possible time frame. In response to another complaint that I hear time and again, I also expect guarantees that enough flexibility will be shown for projects to be replaced if necessary. At the same time, I expect the Commission to reconsider carefully whether the intended lowering of the support rates for major investments in the least affluent areas is necessary and warranted.

Mr President, I, too, am of the opinion that this was a good report, and that the result from the Conciliation Committee opens the way to implementation, which, however, I am sure will take some time yet. The Community's Member States are still, in any case, responsible for the monitoring of feedingstuffs, and, as the parties in this whole process represent very diverse interests, it will be necessary, within the foreseeable future, to discuss monitoring programmes which will standardise supervision of feedingstuffs composition and norms across the board. I am grateful for the key data laid down in the Conciliation Committee, which is in line with my own experience. What worries me, though, is the apportionment of costs, specifically the costs of the declaration itself and for the monitoring of it. I wish to put on record my opposition to the costs continuing to be offloaded onto the farmers. I take the view that the transparency principle means that implementation of the procedure must involve the producers of feedingstuffs, its importers, dealers in it, and, above all, those who monitor it – who will be numerous – also themselves guaranteeing the apportionment of their costs. It is also my opinion that there should be safety standards in the production of feedingstuffs to guarantee and safeguard the health of people and animals, ensuring that no products come onto the market that are dubious from the point of view of health and consumer protection, which, of course, presupposes the principle that good technical production practice does not start, and is not interrupted, at purely arbitrary points. I do think that apportionment on this basis at every production site must prove itself in the next few years and I hope, after this report and after the positive result achieved in the Conciliation Committee, that there will not be another scandal somewhere or other in the foreseeable future, whether in wine, honey, or the many feedingstuffs we can expect to be listed, be they positive, negative, coloured green or anything else, for the list will surely be an enormous one.

Mr President, the report works on the basic assumption that the easily-accessible fresh water reserves have been largely opened up, that long-term water use and savings can be achieved by using economic leverage, and that this would promote the responsible use of water. This requirement can only be met on a world-wide basis. I do not see implementation of the report's objectives on pricing as the high road that we should be taking. Affordable prices are often saddled with negative associations. The cost of clean water depends on the right investments, on technical skill and on better success than hitherto in allocating tasks in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle. The Member States are free to come to their own decisions. It will be difficult to keep to the timetable.

Mr President, the report on the protection of animals during transport has evoked great public interest. Various associations, but above all individual citizens, have watched attentively to see what steps, if any, Parliament will take to prohibit intolerable conditions in the transport of animals. The report's concern is with the use of legislation to prevent animals in transit from being endangered or brought to a cruel demise. Nothing, though, must be left to chance, but there must rather be firm negotiations when the report is elaborated. Among the European rural model's special features, the expectations of society are a decisive element. The BSE crisis and the consequences of the destruction of animals due to the foot-and-mouth epidemic have put a definite question mark against what had so far been achieved. An estimated 250 million farm animals a year are transported across the EU. The people involved have for years vigorously disputed how necessary or pointless this is. This basic regulation itself contains numerous practical and legal provisions on the transport of animals. It is clear that national authorities do not act in the same way everywhere, which shows how weak the animal protection clause really is. There is a lack of seriousness, transparency and honesty in this area. If, for example, hares living wild in Poland are caught with nets and transported into the EU in containers that are torment to them, just so that people can shoot them for sport as a leisure pursuit, that has nothing to do with sport and even less with the protection of animals. I would be happy if the Commissioner were able to say that it does not. At this particular stage of negotiations on the enlargement of Europe, this incident bodes ill for well-regulated agronomy as the basis for protecting Europe's environment and species. The report before us opts, in this sense, for cooperation rather than confrontation between agriculture and animal protection.

Mr President, the 2002 EU Budget, amounting to EUR 51 billion, appears at first sight to be balanced and straightforward. The increase of 5% over the outgoings of the Budget year 2001 corresponds to the Berlin agricultural guidelines. That is not only good but also inevitable, as no other policy is as thoroughly submitted to Community methods as agricultural policy. I note with particular concern, however, that this great chunk of agricultural expenditure is increasingly the object of covetous desires on the part of not a few politicians who see it as a sort of disposable object which can be moved around at will. If this intention is to be countered, the Financial Perspective will have to be qualified by the Commission, any kind of speculation eliminated and the across-the-board cuts that are always being sought in the agricultural budget not in fact implemented. The appearance of foot-and-mouth disease eleven months ago has meant a very unbalanced situation in animal husbandry, especially as regards food safety, animal protection and the internal market. Distorted competition in markets leads to the loss of jobs and income. Pricing is becoming chaotic and nobody can explain why. So I wish to advocate a temporary increase in the financial allocation to the market organisation for animal husbandry. I urge that the so-called interim balance sheet of Agenda 2000 should not be put off simply to do a favour for a particular country. I urge moreover that the reserve should be kept until an explanation is given of the contradiction by which we were talking about EUR 1 billion last year and only EUR 400 million now.

Mr President, strong competition, increasing concentration and globalisation are now key features of manufacturing industry around the world. This creates great advantages, but also disadvantages, for the consumer. Although there are numerous institutions in the EU Member States which are responsible for quality assurance and consumer product regulation, product recall is unfortunately becoming far more common. The purpose of this report is to enforce the precautionary principle in respect of any product placed on the market, and identify suitable approaches. I myself am a producer of consumer goods and so I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur for her proposed solutions, for the task is to protect producers as well as consumers. One option is to harmonise the regulations governing the authorities responsible for product safety. The network of information which will be required in this context will be broad. It is therefore appropriate to expand the existing directive first of all and revise it after a thorough appraisal of the situation. The market cannot be regulated. This is why preventive safety and health measures are especially important. The report contains numerous references to the fact that in the Member States, operators' and producers' rights take precedence over the rights of consumers. The purpose of the report is to change this situation. I fully support this objective. Due to the wide range of products available and the resulting risks to consumer safety and health, a new legislative approach is required. The report makes no secret of this fact. It also makes it clear that an export ban must be adopted for dangerous products. This issue has yet to be considered in detail, and in my view, the proposed period until 2003 is not too long for this process.

Mr President, it is gratifying to see that the media coverage of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease has been focusing chiefly on scientific findings and facts. The BSE situation in particular demonstrates how important it is to be able to depend on independent research into food resources, research that is geared to the long-term acquisition of knowledge. Highly complex though the proposal for the creation of a Food Authority may be, the thing it lacks most is a wealth of ideas. I am convinced that the selection of tasks for the new authority from the many sound proposals can only be made in accordance with the latest research findings from the national establishments. Current food legislation is undoubtedly complicated and will surely not improve if its refinement is entrusted to lawyers alone. For that reason, I believe that the necessary funds should be allocated to the budget on the basis of a scientific needs assessment. The proposal for the creation of a Food Authority already has a head start, because the bodies representing the farming community and the food industry accept the need for such an authority and support its creation, which undoubtedly augurs well for the future. Those who deal with livestock and the foodstuffs that are derived from them need a lobby which, in the context of the continuing globalisation of food markets, can make a convincing case for their products and, above all, can protect them from misguided policies. Satisfying the exacting demands that society makes of its food producers is crucial to their success or failure. The consumption of meat and meat products is rising slowly, and their prices are developing in line with production costs. Consumers require comprehensive information about the processing and the nutritional value of meat and meat products. I am one of those who believe there is still a great deal of work to be done here, for there are many who have relapsed into a blinkered supply-and-demand view of food policy and are unable to look beyond the shop counter. Meat will play a major role in the months and years ahead – and rightly so, in my opinion. The traditional planning of menus from a shopping basket of fruit, vegetables and meat provides a far greater volume of healthy nutrients than ready-made convenience foods. But what is a fair price for healthy food? Two thousand years ago, Hippocrates said that food should be our medicine and medicine our food. I believe his precept holds good today, and I would answer my question by citing the need for prices to reflect quality. Issues of ecology and ethics play a part in the production of foodstuffs. The ecological and ethical principles that will underlie the work of the Food Authority must be precisely defined.

Mr President, Agenda 2000 sets out the key indicators for the domains of agricultural, structural and finance policy in the EU for the period from 2000 to 2006. Its aim was to sever the link between aid and production levels in the relevant product markets while keeping the loss of income and jobs within reasonable bounds, an aim which was formulated at a time when the restructuring process seemed destined to run fairly smoothly. After the outbreaks of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease, the beef and veal markets collapsed with no sign of an early return to stability. Farmers are counting on the additional special funds being provided now rather than disappearing in an interminable bureaucratic labyrinth. The promises made in the initial weeks of the crisis regarding the special purchase scheme must first be honoured. Incorporating this scheme into long-term plans to alter the organisation of the market in beef and veal will exacerbate the financial situation of beef producers. The present draft amendment to the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal essentially fulfils the Commission’s aim of reducing the oversupply of these products. Some of the proposals, however, have nothing at all to do with the consequences of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease. The quality of products is not automatically better if a farm is bigger or is managed in a particular way. Present market trends are unlikely to act as an incentive to invest in beef production. The fixing of any form of ceiling for the payment of support is therefore an unwarranted additional financial burden on those who have already made investments. Farmers depend on this income, and the 90-head limit will certainly be resisted.

Mr President, the foot-and-mouth epidemic in Great Britain and its spread to mainland Europe clearly demonstrate that the disease apparently cannot be halted with the current strategy. I do not believe that we are out of the woods yet. Ever since the first case of foot-and-mouth disease, the Commission has supported the slaughter of lambs and the blazing pyres, and has been reluctant to approve other methods of tackling the disease which might have been agreed at national level. In my view, this is a major political risk, as the costs and benefits are very difficult to quantify. Putting our money on the economy from the outset would have been the right approach. A vaccination programme at the very start of the foot-and-mouth outbreak would have saved a great deal of money, but above all, it would have saved a great deal of personal suffering. It is estimated that around 200 million livestock are moved around the EU every year. Traceability in this commercial chain, especially in the necessary chronological order, is always problematical and uncertain. Even in normal years – without BSE and foot-and-mouth crises – the error rates are high. The common agricultural policy has its own powerful momentum, and it is difficult to halt it once it is under way. That is why it would have been necessary to identify a number of viable and practical alternatives to the current strategy to combat FMD. The present approach is mediocre and irrational – so I am delighted that it is to be changed. Beef consumption has decreased by 50 per cent. Prices have hit rock-bottom, and the monthly wages bill can no longer be covered from beef production. Commissioner Fischler's compensation programme is to be enhanced with an eighth point, namely the removal of the penalty bonus for the milk quota. This makes sense, as cattle sales have been stopped. Jobs and livelihoods in agriculture, food production and processing are at stake. There is no longer any rural tourism, even in areas which are free of FMD. Even relatives are staying at home. Patching this up through a "rural renewal" programme could take years. After all, cattle cannot be produced overnight. Vaccination must be utilised more effectively throughout Europe as a normal instrument to combat the disease. It must be ensured, in this context, that vaccinated animals and their products are commercially viable, in other words, that they can be marketed without any trade barriers. Discriminatory tests must be developed as a matter of urgency in order to allow vaccinated animals to be easily distinguished from infected stock. This should also make it easier for the Commission to give the Member States more scope than before to have their say in decisions on measures to prevent and eradicate the disease.

Mr President, the report on the WTO negotiating package quite rightly calls for agricultural issues to be retained as an essential element of the negotiating mandate within the framework of the existing agreement. There must be no trade-off of concessions in the agricultural sector in exchange for concessions in other negotiating areas. This is necessary in order to safeguard the continued existence of the small-scale agricultural landscape, rural employment, environmental and resource protection, and modulated agricultural programmes, and to protect them from the impact of global market liberalisation. Adopting and guaranteeing a high level of consumer protection in the EU makes substantial demands on agriculture in particular, and is the main prerequisite for fair trade in agricultural products without border controls. Over recent decades, the European food industry has benefited considerably from global market development, especially as regards the processing of agricultural products with high, or the highest, value added. As the second-largest exporter of agricultural products, and by far the largest exporter of processed food, the European Union, therefore, has a significant interest in a well-functioning system of global trade. What is important for the negotiations is to ensure that the actors from sustainable agriculture are not played off against one other, and that this form of agriculture is harmonised. The issues of food safety and rural employment, consumer protection and the environment, as well as the sparing use of all resources, are viewed in different ways by the various actors, who also afford them different political priority. At the same time, the WTO should be focusing on issues which are moving up the public agenda. They include health, the environment, and social affairs, and not just as three separate issues.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I have two questions. The current precautions in connection with BSE have been eclipsed by the dangerous foot-and-mouth epidemic. I remember back in the 1950s, when whole villages were quarantined in order to prevent the epidemic from spreading. How are the severe restrictions on movements of animals being enforced, Commissioner? What I mean is, anyone who still fails post-BSE to comply with regulations should be taught a serious lesson using other means. How secure is the situation in the European Community regarding labelling obligations? You said that culling and the travelling ban are currently the main objectives. How prepared are you to vaccinate animals which must surely be scattered throughout Europe on a strategic basis in order to help prevent the disease from spreading? Are you well prepared?

 Mr President, every Member State in the European Union applies policies on women and families. The way in which they do so depends mainly on their constitution and political institutions. Despite some progress in the treatment of women in paid employment and in implementing equal treatment boundaries throughout Europe, sexual inequality persists. The main aspects are correctly presented in the report. This applies to the description of the situation of self-employed women, to gender-specific wage differentials and to differences in types of employment and unpaid work. These economic ups and downs have serious consequences on the standard of living of individual families, most of the responsibility for which is shouldered by women. As 8 March approaches, we need to get the point across that a person's achievements count for more than his or her sex. Domestic violence and stereotypes, not to mention mediaeval perceptions of a woman's place, should be consigned to the past once and for all. I want a Europe with one culture, where the dignity of men and women and of foreigners and immigrants is an asset, not an economic burden. The report considers that all is not well here. Nonetheless, the number of immigrants is rising, begging the conclusion that it really is time to create optimum conditions in the European Union, otherwise conflicts may intensify. The report should cover these tasks more amply. I would remind you that enlargement to the East is imminent, bringing with it many women with different traditions and different cultures who need to be attended to, not sidelined.

 The report on the proposal to approximate the laws of Member States relating to food supplements is one more step in the right direction of disclosing the unnatural content of foodstuffs. But quality not quantity matters. Food supplements should be ruthlessly declared and officially monitored. They should not be added to foodstuffs until they have been reported to the competent authorities. The annexed list has been drawn up for this purpose. There is no reason not to introduce the duty to report in the same way in all Member States as quickly as possible. My group has said it is in favour of implementing the White Paper on food safety in a more forward-looking way, not only to avert distorting the market, but also to implement the overall concept of the White Paper more ruthlessly. The checks and balances within intracommunity trade, which have been created by necessary laws, are inadequately enforced by the controls which are currently in place. That is why the measures to set up the already approved food standards agencies must be implemented. After BSE, inter alia
, the confidence of consumers must be regained through more transparency in the food production chain, safety and proper labelling. I would like to point out that I cannot concur with the speech given by Commissioner Fischler. European agricultural policy has been reduced to the lowest common denominator. Europe must not shirk its responsibility. I am firmly convinced that the public debate is only just beginning.

 Mr President, in my view, Mrs Theorin's report goes a long way towards meeting the requirement that women should have equal social status. She has chosen her words carefully in denouncing violations of women's dignity and in demanding action to achieve change. The report not only refers to the social exclusion of women as a problem in itself, it also rightly emphasises that protection against criminality and personal safety are no longer something that can be guaranteed solely within national borders. I therefore support the demands made in the report for women to be given the right to diplomatic influence. I support the initiative taken in this report and I support the statement contained in it that sexually abused women need the Community's protection and that it is high time the perpetrators stopped going unpunished. Women and men, and people in general, are all different. Equal opportunities means treating people differently – but how they are treated is still determined by the people themselves.

Mr President, changing a market organisation is always a difficult decision and the objective, when weighing the alternatives, is to achieve as accurate a market-regulating intervention in supply and demand as possible, so as to ensure that production, in this case the production of pigmeat, secures farmers' incomes. For a long time this has not been the case. The report has been resisted and rejected. Some of the demands go beyond the report because there is much which is out of kilter in the beef and pigmeat sectors. The latest cases of BSE will result in reduced production and will eclipse everything put in place hitherto. The globalisation of the economy is a red herring here and cyclical crises have absolutely nothing to do with it. Slaughter cattle are being driven right across Europe, animal stocks are being cut back in return for state subsidies and huge ecological installations are being built. Nor does this report offer any ready solutions; too much else needs to be done for that. But the report does try to bundle production by applying the principle of voluntary action and by forming producer groups. This is an honest and credible endeavour and I shall recommend that my group vote in favour.

 Mr President, the sheer number of food scandals and the debate about using genetic engineering in food production have undermined the present food safety system. Optimum food safety standards and falling consumer protection standards cannot be reconciled. So something else is needed here, and I believe that too. But I am in favour of most responsibility remaining with the Member States. The Community is the world's largest importer and exporter of food. This sector has an annual turnover of EUR 600 billion and employs 10 million people. I support everyone involved, be it in a political, administrative or other capacity, who is working on a "food for all" strategy. The developed industrialised nations are also best placed to make the greatest contribution here, through sustainable and varied food production. The White Paper is a political paper for those in positions of responsibility in food production. A zero-risk policy is not really practical. That is why the preventive measures in the White Paper constitute the real action plans. What is more, there is no European flavour here. National peculiarities should not only be respected, but actually encouraged. This is where the only weak points in the White Paper on food safety lie. Certain questions remain unanswered, such as: what will the relationship be between the Food Safety Agency and consumers? How is it to be financed and how will it cooperate with the Member States? What about liability? Up to now, of course, it has been the innocent parties who have paid. The Commission will have to provide more concrete answers to these questions in its continued work.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking for my group, I assume that the report on the proposal for a directive on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs will obtain the consent of the European Parliament. I also expect the Commission to stipulate the necessary measures along with a strict timetable in order to ensure that the directive is applied in the Member States of the Union. The basis for the introduction of open declarations, in other words the full listing of all feed materials, differs extremely widely between Member States. The standards are scarcely comparable, let alone transferable. In the long production chain for compound feedingstuffs, there are sharply divergent degrees of interest in the traceability of feed materials. The BSE scandal was the worst and most notorious example. Farmers are still suffering today from that utterly criminal failure to protect consumers. As we have seen, it took years to rectify matters. Let me say categorically that the application of the numerous necessary rules and regulations on the control and monitoring of feedingstuffs must, in my opinion, proceed from the premise that transparency for the consumer is paramount. When it produces its own report, the Commission can prove that transparency is not a modern word for bureaucratic procedures and that danger exists, since the legal provisions on food safety are supposed to cover the entire soil-plant-animal cycle. The report does not make it immediately clear to everyone precisely whom or what this transparency is intended to benefit. Let me finish by stressing that the report, like the labelling of beef, will come down on the side of the consumer more than on that of the production chain. Given the surplus production in Europe, this is the safer bet and will pay dividends in the long run.

As we have already seen in connection with the integration of Western European States into the European Community, agriculture and food is one of the most complex areas of negotiation. Each enlargement has required long-term preparatory measures as well as transitional and special arrangements, often lasting for several years. I believe that we are right to expect the applicant States of Central and Eastern Europe to implement similar special and transitional measures. We should also do well to remember that, because of the great economic and social significance of farming and its output, a competitive agricultural and food-supply structure will be a vitally important factor in the success of these countries' transformation and restructuring processes. Agriculture is a domain which is largely regulated on the basis of uniform binding European rules and regulations. National powers are greatly restricted. Whether we like it or not, almost 50% of the EU budget has to be spent on the maintenance of this agricultural policy. It was decided in Berlin to allocate approximately EUR 3.1 billion a year to the gradual integration of the applicant countries for the period from 2000 to 2006, which amounts to a total of about EUR 21.8 billion, and to earmark a further EUR 58.1 billion for enlargement from the year 2002. From where we stand at present, this financial framework will not suffice in resolving the complicated processes involved in the forthcoming round of integrations, especially from the point of view of ensuring that they are socially acceptable. The financial framework for the enlargement of the Union, however, can only be facilitated through a rise in the current Member States' contributions and not through constant cuts in planned expenditure on the various Community policies. This is a truth that has to be told. The opposite approach would drive a wedge through the farming community and endanger the social development of rural areas throughout Europe. According to an old German saying, if the farmers are thriving the state will thrive. There is a great deal of wisdom in that saying, and it is still applicable today.

 Mr President, the forthcoming Water Framework Directive is based on the justified principle that citizens of the European Community are entitled to use drinking water on a daily basis. This should be provided for by law. A simple, uniform and coordinated Community law on the protection of water and groundwater is to be welcomed. Important directives such as those on protecting the food we eat, on municipal sewage disposal, on plant protection and on nitrates are being revised and redefined on the basis both of ecological criteria and criteria of origin. The tasks are therefore broadly defined. As a farmer, I advocate the closer involvement of those who represent the interests of professional groups and serious consideration of their criticisms. Farming, forestry, fisheries and, in particular, the horticultural industry should also be involved in the decision-making process so that the required combination of voluntary restraint and state regulation is achieved. The calls for zero limit values can hardly be met by means of legislation alone. Transposing the directive presents a genuine challenge for the Member States of the European Community. I agree with the rapporteur: it is only through cooperation that success can be achieved.

 Mr President, the rules governing the voluntary labelling system provided for in the 1999 EU regulation expire on 31 August. The Council regulation before us must be adopted to avoid a legal vacuum arising. The agreement reached by the EU Agriculture Ministers on a Europe-wide beef labelling system was not such a major achievement. The work in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was in fact much more demanding than the result before us. The content of all the measures approved is to be modified so that proof of meat’s origin is valid as a guarantee in order to apply environmental control procedures and if necessary impose sanctions.  The Community labelling system quite rightly aims to enhance transparency of production and marketing conditions for beef, and in particular to improve certainty as to its origin. Higher product costs cannot be ruled out, as the cost of applying the system will be passed on to the consumer. The incalculable risk as regards food quality will not be dramatically reduced in this way, as the information provided is not primarily intended for the consumer. The last 16 years, since the first outbreak of mad cow disease, have demonstrated the importance of production for consumer confidence. The most effective measure is to strengthen production in the region of origin, which is more justifiable both environmentally and economically speaking.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, adoption of the 2000/2001 agricultural price package involves a commitment to save EUR 300 million from the agriculture budget and to use the appropriations released for reconstruction work in Kosovo. In this context the report rightly points out that the Commission ought to submit a general document on this to Parliament, in the form of a concrete plan, before further austerity proposals can be accepted. Without a doubt, the issue of funding the whole reform package plays a decisive role. What I do not find satisfactory in this process, however, is the fact that we always speak first of reducing expenditure and revenue while at the same time transferring ever more tasks to the Commission, which, of course, does not reduce costs either. Up until 2006 the Commission should work on the basis of the realistic targets set and should deduce its financial needs from them. As a result of Agenda 2000, European farmers had to accept a EUR 5 billion reduction in their income. This meant that the agriculture budget was fixed at EUR 50.5 billion and it should stay as such. To achieve its objectives, the Commission should, in my view, be invited to present a report showing how costs have changed in the agricultural sector. Today, more deals are concluded in a second than used to be in an entire day and change is the only constant. Agricultural prices change particularly quickly. In the EU in 1999, the prices of crop products fell by 4% and livestock products by 6%. As a result of excessive over-production, pig prices fell by 9%. All the important agricultural products such as milk, beef, cereals and pork are suffering from increased turbulence on the world’s foreign exchanges, reducing farmers’ incomes still further. That is why we are still far from answering the question of how European Union farmers should make a living in the future. In the saturated marketplace, only products produced economically can be sold. The price reductions will destroy farmers’ livelihoods in Europe and thus temporarily ease the pressure on the market. Following this structural change the agricultural holdings which have been able to survive will further increase their output and wield even greater power on the world market. Another price war will lead to a new round of market redistribution. Further developments will show whether the reform of the EU’s agricultural policy by means of Agenda 2000 is capable of achieving its overall aims or not.

 Mr President, I strongly support Mrs Schierhuber’s report on food aid. Being myself a producer of food under the provisions of the Berlin decisions, which have already been widely discussed in public, I am aware how insane and inconsistent it is to use various methods to cut production in the EU while there is hunger in the world. Nowhere is it written that sections of the world population that live in an environment that has been destroyed by natural disasters or wars must not be allowed to eat. One euro a day is enough for survival and offers a chance for the future. That is feasible, in any case. In this regard, the European Union, the Member States, politicians, industry and science must take responsibility and break down the wall between prosperity and hunger once and for all. How will future generations judge us, I ask myself? By the flood of megamergers that lead to ever larger and more uncontrollable giant undertakings, or by whether we manage to adopt targeted measures in the next ten years to combat poverty by cancelling the debts of developing countries, as an initial but necessary step? The report rightly refers to a whole range of guidelines on fighting poverty. For reasons of time I cannot go into them in detail. But the careful observer will notice that there are different weightings at work here. They are reflected in phrases such as “priority to the least developed countries” when allocating food aid, or “alleviation of poverty and hunger of the most vulnerable groups”. I am glad I am not one of those who have to distinguish on a daily basis between “a bit hungry” or “starving”, as it is currently presented in the media, while regrettably little is being done. The main part of the report correctly makes reference to the fact that its aim, ultimately, should be to make food aid unnecessary. But we cannot do that unless the politicians agree that hunger is not a political weapon and unless the responsible leaders in every area of society all realise that we only have the world on lease from our children. We hold the goods of this earth on trust for our descendants. If we take that approach, then I am convinced we really can combat poverty.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, consumers can be given a guaranteed indication of origin for the majority, I repeat the majority of foodstuffs and for beef in its many and varied forms, if they so wish. The basis for this was and still is the passport for each individual animal which provides information on place, origin and birth. Thanks to comprehensive controls of and the wealth of data on the animal trade, the place of origin and rearing can be proven. What I mean is that we are not starting from square one and, as a producer of several tonnes of beef a year, I know what I am talking about. The latest crisis in the foodstuffs sector may justify the introduction of stricter standards, as contained in the report; however, where possible, red tape should be reduced. I agree with all the proposed amendments which are predicated upon greater promotion of regional marketing and processing of agricultural products and which help to build up regional markets and create greater transparency, irrespective of the date on which they are introduced.

Mr President, securing the future has always been a difficult issue, irrespective of whether it takes the form of a White Paper, deregulation, partnership or structural adjustment. It is the financial situation which dictates future development. The major topics are correctly positioned in the main report, but the report lacks content. Fighting unemployment through economic growth is the greatest challenge facing Europe. The Lisbon Summit announced the direction to be taken up to the year 2010. We must therefore expect future intergovernmental conferences to substantiate how this is to be done. Farmers and cooperatives expect the European Commission to reduce the amount of red tape in the agricultural economy and adopt budgetary guidelines based on calculation, reliability and progressive structures. The Berlin resolutions set out agricultural policy up to the year 2006. Farmers and politicians fought hard for this position. If a premature review should be necessary, because the social analysis uses different standards, then let it only be in comparison with facts and figures, and let us retain what was successful, i.e. reliability, rather than dismantling Agenda 2000 piece by piece until what is left is hardly recognisable. The ink was barely dry on the budget 2000 when Mrs Schreyer demanded a financial review and financial perspective for the priorities, together with action on negative expenditure. Unless these funds are channelled back into the agricultural budget, Agenda 2000 will be jeopardised, especially as further technical inconsistencies are to be expected. This is a policy based on rough estimates and founded on pure observation. Of course, the Balkans must be reconstructed but, overall, in a spirit of social solidarity. Then, and I am convinced of this, the farmers and cooperatives will also make their contribution.

Mr President, the first common regulations in the fisheries sector were adopted as early as 1970. Over the years, the Commission has provided the Council and Parliament with a steady stream of communications on the market situation for fisheries products. The object of the exercise was to debate the future prospects of a sustainable European fisheries policy, or rather, to redetermine the content, with regard to production, trade, marketing and various other spheres. I can only make brief mention here of key words such as competition, security of production, quality of production, and others. The report, which I endorse, also leads one to form the conclusion that the Commission is still a very long way off the realisation of its goal, that of developing a sustainable fisheries policy.   Several Articles and proposed amendments refer to the difficulties that have not yet been resolved. The implementing regulation will clear a few matters up. I also support all those evaluations that refer to the fact that the 265 000 fishermen working in the EC, who often live in remote coastal areas and who work and secure an income on the bottom rung of Objective 1 Regions, are not sufficiently well-prepared for the establishment of a common EU internal market, in view of the opening up of the world trade market.  I would also like to draw your attention at this point to the structural problems in pond management, and to the question of how it relates to agriculture. Since I am unable to go into the current grey area in greater detail, I would propose that we use a new fisheries policy to make clear decisions in this regard as well.

 Mr President, because of the availability of high-technology additives in the feedingstuffs industry, detailed information on their use is needed from the actors, and as we know there are a lot of them, so that we can put a stop to practices which infringe Community law. This directive on additives in feedingstuffs cannot achieve this on its own. Other directives will follow and I believe that the Committee on Agriculture is well placed to deal with them. Up the point at which meat, milk, bread and other products are sold over the shop counter, feedingstuffs and additives are structured, mixed, blended, cut and transported several times. The fight by feedingstuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems, just as it does in the foodstuffs industry. The negative consequences are well known, the positive ones less so. I am firmly convinced that the most sensible way of protecting the health of European citizens in the ecological chain is through the production of feedingstuffs in the region for the region. However, more work is needed on this.

 Madam President, against the background of a predictably fiercer debate about farming products costing as little as possible, a lot of damage has been caused to food production in the EC. Many active farmers who were working in accordance with good rural practice had to cease production. No details at all have so far been given of the costs of this. The massive industrial contamination of feedingstuffs through additives introduced without regard for any maximum permitted limit leaves the consumer with the justified impression that the production of animal feed has degenerated into its mere exploitation.  Disposing of used sludge and sewage sludge may be a problem, but guaranteeing the safety of animal feed additives must be placed higher on the political agenda than it has been so far. I expect the Commission, when it creates a food agency, to specify that animal feed should be traceable back to its origins and to formulate legal provisions which penalise criminal practices and reward working farmers. But this has to happen quickly.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the decision in the court case against Leyla Zana shows beyond doubt that Turkey is not yet ready negotiate its accession to the EU. Unaffected by the official reforms in Turkey, the court is doing things the way they were done in the old days, so anyone who had attended the hearings – as I did – could conclude that the initial judgment, founded upon one sentence spoken in Kurdish and harshly criticised by the European Court of Human Rights, would be upheld. Turkey could have used the trial as a means of demonstrating that its reforms of the justice system exist not only on paper. This was not, in the final analysis, about the minutiae of the law, but about a woman whose fate had become a symbol of the failure of Turkish politics and Turkish justice, a woman whose trial was a test of how seriously reforms were being taken. Neither that, nor the fact that the eyes of the world were upon them, could induce the court to conduct a trial in accordance with the rule of law. Let me ask you this, then: if even the case of Leyla Zana cannot bring about change in the Turkish legal system, how are reforms to be implemented at all? In principle – and let me make this clear – I am in favour of Turkey joining the EU, provided that it meets the relevant conditions. Turkey has known for years that there must be drastic change in it if it is to have a prospect of acceding, but yesterday’s judgment shows that the willingness to do so is still not yet present, and so the EU must now, at last, cut short all this talk about the commencement of accession negotiations being imminent. Those who, in the aftermath of this ruling, continue to insist that accession negotiations will be possible in six months’ time, show only their indifference to the Copenhagen criteria and their interest in the implementation of strategic objectives to the exclusion of all else. Far from it; the fact remains that the criteria for accession to the EU have been laid down and must still be met. For as long as Turkey ignores that fact, there can be no accession negotiations.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the efforts of Mr Oostlander’s report to do justice to developments in Turkey. The many amendments have clearly improved the report. The problem areas have now been stated in more concrete terms and the criticism has generally been couched in more objective language than before. There nevertheless remains one anomaly that cannot be overlooked. Although religious minorities are discussed at quite some length, it is somewhat surprising that the concerns of the Kurdish population – some 20 million people – are dealt with rather briefly. In view of the multifarious harassments and threats they have been exposed to, it is an intolerable trivialisation of the issue to call upon the Turkish Government to create a more relaxed and constructive relationship with its own citizens of Kurdish origin. I would certainly have preferred to see clear words of criticism here. Ultimately, the problems are many and varied. The precarious situation of the human rights organisation EHD, for example, is given no mention at all. Its premises were searched only recently. Threats are commonplace, and some reference to the difficult position of human rights activists in Turkey would have been appropriate. Criticism regarding the case of Leyla Zana and the other DEP party MPs could have been expressed more clearly. Three days of negotiations have already taken place, but they are still in prison. The negotiations process resembles a farce, and seems far from likely that the court will lift its sentence violating human rights and set them free. The report makes absolutely no mention of the case of Öçalan. His trial, too, was classified as unfair by the European Court of Human Rights. It would therefore also be appropriate to reopen his case. It is evidently too delicate an issue, however, for the name of Öçalan to bear mention in a report of the European Parliament. The report rightly condemns the banning of HADEP and the threat of court action to ban DEHAP. There is no mention, however, of the order prohibiting leading members of HADEP from engaging in political activity. Why not? A clear stand should have been taken on this issue. On the other hand, in other places the report would have benefited from being less arrogant. I find it unspeakable that the report refers to the humanist and Judeo-Christian culture of Europe, making out that Europe has always been a stronghold of democracy, the rule of law, human and minority rights, and freedom of religion and conscience. It patronisingly adds that an Islamic country too can accept and defend these values. Completely aside from the fact that Islam too has always played a part in Europe, I would like to recall, as a German especially, that the values that are allegedly so typically European are not quite so deeply rooted in Europe. European history ranges across the Christian Crusades to the crimes of the colonial era – not to mention the horrors of fascism. Moreover, the reference to religion is utterly superfluous. The EU is a political and economic union. For a country to accede to it, there are clear criteria that must be fulfilled. Whether they are fulfilled against a Christian, Muslim, Jewish or atheist background is irrelevant. The main thing is that they are fulfilled. In Turkey at the moment, this is unfortunately not the case. The report, despite all its shortcomings, demonstrates this and makes it clear that there are no plans to open accession negotiations at the present time. It is to the report’s credit, however, that it also clearly states that accession in general for Turkey remains a possibility. Let us hope that the report will contribute to changing the policy of the Turkish Government in such a way that enables Turkey to accede to the European Union.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, human rights have yet again been trampled on in Turkey. With a representative of the Turkish Public Prosecutor’s office present, the offices of the IHD in Ankara were searched by the authorities and everything in them seized. Yet again it was the largest human rights organisation in Turkey that was on the receiving end of this treatment, and, yet again, it was terrorism that served as the pretext for it. What I ask you is this: how much longer are things to go on like this? Is this what Turkey’s reform process adds up to? Can it still seriously be believed that it matters to Turkey whether or not it fulfils the Copenhagen criteria? The Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left protests emphatically against the Turkish authorities’ actions. The latest raid on the IHD is but the last in a series of hostile acts against this human rights organisation. Let us remind ourselves that, since 1991, over ten members of the IHD have been murdered, and that, in May 1998, the organisation’s chairman, Akin Birdal, was gunned down in his office. In the last parliamentary elections, neither he nor other representatives of HADEP were allowed to stand as candidates. According to Amnesty International, in the last couple of years alone, over four hundred separate court actions have been commenced against the IHD, to which must be added the innumerable cases brought against individual members. Mrs Eren Keskin, a lawyer and deputy chairman of the IHD, has just been barred from practising law for a year. Over and over again, the charge is ‘separatist propaganda’. Is this Turkey’s new way of handling human rights? It was with a great deal of sympathy that we all watched as the reform process in Turkey was inaugurated. Both in the European Union and among the Turkish people, there were high hopes for a new policy on the part of the Turkish Government, but these hopes have so far been in vain. Turkey must make changes to critical aspects of its policies, not merely to forms of words, but also in practice. Only then will it have a realistic prospect of acceding to the EU. Recent months have shown that there is no shortage of problem areas. Let us mention first the banning of HADEP, yet another ban imposed on a party that champions in particular the concerns of minorities in Turkey. Turkey still relies on the banning of political parties as a means of silencing the voices of those who take a critical view of the government’s policies. In the meantime, the DEHAP – the alliance of parties as part of which HADEP contested the latest parliamentary elections – is also threatened with a ban. Is that, I ask you, democracy? Is that freedom of opinion? Then there is the legal action against Mrs Leyla Zana, a former member of the Turkish parliament, whose party, the DEP, was also proscribed. While we must welcome the fact that there is at last a retrial, what does it amount to? So far, it appears to be a repeat of the proceedings in 1994, which the European Court of Human Rights categorised as unfair. The judges are, admittedly, no longer military men, but there is a massive military presence in the courtroom. Even after two days of proceedings, there is no prospect of Mrs Zana being released. Let us remind ourselves that her offence, for which she was sentenced to fifteen years in jail, was a sentence spoken in the Turkish parliament – in Kurdish, her mother tongue. Then there is the authorities’ continuing arbitrary treatment of the Kurds, who, even after formal changes to the law, are far from being treated as having equal rights. Harassment and sweeping accusations of separatism continue to be the order of the day. The use of the Kurdish language, too, is still subject to considerable restrictions. There continues to be no evidence that Turkey is making any effort to set in motion a real process of democratisation, or to involve all elements in Turkish society in seeking solutions to its manifold problems. Then there are the conditions in police stations and prisons. Anyone who is put into custody in Turkey can reckon, with a high degree of probability, on being mistreated, especially if he or she is a member of a minority group. Elementary rights, such as the right to have contact with family members and legal counsel, are often granted only on a restricted basis or disregarded altogether. The most prominent example of this is Abdullah Öcalan, who has for months had virtually no contact with the outside world. The list could go on and on. This is where we might bear Cyprus in mind. It has to be said, for all these reasons, that the road Turkey must travel before it joins Europe is still, alas, a long one. The assumption that Turkey can hope for accession negotiations with the EU without fundamental changes to its policies is an illusion. Turkey will have a prospect of accession only if it proves that it takes the Copenhagen criteria seriously. It is up to Turkey to show by its policies what value it really places upon accession to the EU.

 Mr President, I would like to endorse what Mr Alyssandrakis has said. Yesterday, in the context of the EU's Parliamentary Delegation to Turkey, I also asked the Turkish ambassador why prisoners were not allowed visits from their lawyers and families. We were given the answer that representatives of the Council of Europe had visited Mr Ocalan about a month ago, and that we should address our enquiries to the relevant committee of the Council of Europe. Whatever our attitude towards them, whether or not we sympathise with them, we believe that every prisoner should receive fair treatment, which includes the right to meet with legal counsel and with their family members. That is a value in terms of human rights and democracy under the rule of law, and that is something to which we are committed. I therefore reiterate my request to you that you should put the case to the Turkish Government for access to legal counsel to be allowed in the future.

Mr President, the Turkish Constitutional Court has today proscribed HADEP, the pro-Kurd People's Democracy Party, and has, among other things, forbidden forty-six of its members to take part in any kind of political activity for the next five years. Turkey is a candidate for accession to the European Union, in which it is not acceptable for political parties to be banned in this day and age. Mr President, I ask you to intervene in this matter.

 I voted in favour of the report on the representation of women among the social partners of the European Union. According to statistics produced by the European Trade Union Congress, the proportion of women in positions of leadership is under 25%, which is far too low. I believe that it is particularly important to achieve balanced representation of women at leadership level in trade unions, which, in wage negotiations, play an important part in promoting equality of opportunity. It has emerged from various studies that women are seriously under-represented in wage negotiations, the consequence of which is that women's issues are taken too little into account in the labour market. Women know what the real working conditions of female employees are and where equality is lacking. If more women were to be in charge of negotiations, I am quite sure that greater consideration would be given to women's interests in the labour market. I therefore call on the social partners to devise support programmes for women in order that their presence in decision-making circles may be enhanced. The interests of female employees must not be ignored.

 Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Haarder for his reply. Unfortunately, my questions about KADEK were not answered. This was what I asked: what is your assessment of the organisation and, in the future, will KADEK also be included in the list of terrorist organisations? Mr Haarder has not said a word about this. As regards the other point, I would like to point out once again that if we are going to discuss the list of terrorist organisations, we should look at the situation from the Kurdish perspective as well. More than four thousand Kurdish villages have been completely destroyed. Who will take action here and protect the Kurdish people? Surely terrorists are at work here too? Or let's take the case of Leyla Zana. The European Parliament honoured Leyla Zana with its Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. She was sentenced to imprisonment in Turkey for supporting the PKK. According to the new list published in Turkey, Leyla Zana is a terrorist. The question is this: what terrorist act did Leyla Zana, a Member of the Turkish Parliament, commit to warrant her being classed as a terrorist?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the concerns, desires and worries of young people must be taken seriously, and so I welcome Mrs Gröner's report on the Commission's White Paper for Europe's young people. It is proposed that greater account should be taken of young people's needs when framing measures in different policy areas in the European Union. We must give young people the opportunity to demonstrate active commitment by getting involved in public life. In Germany, the Pisa survey came up with some sobering results. It is for that reason that I advocate a reform of schools policy which would have to incorporate the aspirations of students and young people. I do think that young people's participation in public life is especially important. Today, young people are involving themselves less and less in traditionally structured organisations such as political parties and trade unions. This is seen especially in the extent to which young people take part in elections at national and European level. It is young people in particular whom we must encourage to stand as candidates at local, national and European level, and we must actively support them in doing so. I urge that young people's votes and opinions on political matters should not be shrugged off as an irrelevance. I find it particularly regrettable that the Commission White Paper devotes too little space to the gender angle, an aspect that I believe cannot be excluded from consideration. Young women must be promoted in every respect, as women still do not have the same opportunities as men in the labour market. Top jobs are mainly held by men. The unemployment rate is higher in Europe for women and women earn on average less than their male colleagues. I commit myself to women getting the same opportunities as men in the labour market. I am glad that the fight against racism is given an important place in the White Paper. This is especially important in view of the way in which people are discriminated against on the basis of their different skin colour or of their belonging to an ethnic or religious minority. We have to encourage young people to reach out to other cultures, which I am convinced leads to each enriching the other. Dialogue promotes mutual understanding among peoples in the cause of peace. I am committed to people in Europe not only living alongside each other, but, above all, being able to live with each other. Our willingness to reach out to those who are different or foreign gains us a view of the world that is cosmopolitan and tolerant. Youth policy must be accorded a particular value at national and European level, and this means that schemes for young people need to be appropriately financially resourced. I consider it particularly important that Community programmes should give adequate support to projects that benefit young people. Our European home must not be built without taking into account the concerns of young people, and so I urge that their conceptions of Europe's future should have an influence on the Convention. If we ignore young people's interests, our European home will rest on unsteady foundations, for the young of today are tomorrow's future!

The resolution adopted by Parliament today is a step in the right direction, and we emphatically welcome it, for there is no reasonable alternative to a political solution, and the Sharon Government's present bellicose response to the terrorist attacks by Palestinian fanatics, which are contemptuous of human life, is no longer acceptable. As the resolution expressly states, Israel's military escalation offends against international law and human rights. In no way does it contribute to ending the terror, but is, rather, directed against the Palestinian civilian population and is destroying the Palestinian infrastructure. We emphatically endorse Parliament's call for the immediate implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions 1397, 1402 and 1403, and especially for the immediate withdrawal of the Israeli army from Palestinian territory 
as well as for the condemnation of the attacks against Israel by suicidal terrorists. To place Arafat, a democratically elected president, under house arrest is wholly unacceptable. We firmly welcome Parliament's expression of support for an arms embargo on Palestine and Israel, as well as its call for the Council and the Commission to consider suspending the Association Agreement between Israel and the European Union. It is, moreover, significant that Parliament is demanding free access for the media to the occupied territories and expressing its full support for Israeli, Palestinian and international organisations that are actively working for the restoration of peace in the Middle East. We unreservedly support the condemnation in Parliament's resolution of the many anti-Semitic attacks in Europe on synagogues, Jewish schools and cemeteries. Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure.

Mr President, in no way has the human rights situation in Turkey improved over the past year. I am in favour of Turkey's admittance to the EU, but the Copenhagen criteria must be met. Whilst I welcome the amendments to the constitution, they fall far short of my expectations. Turkey must take still further action, or else it will not be able to join the EU. The death penalty has not been abolished, but only restricted. Turkish politicians show little zeal when it comes to putting the changes to the constitution into practice. Whilst Arabic, English, German and Chinese may be taught at Turkish institutions of higher education, Kurdish, the mother tongue of 12 million people, remains barred from the education system. Over 10 000 students who availed themselves of their constitutionally guaranteed right and petitioned for Kurdish to be allowed, now face criminal proceedings. They are charged with separatism. Any peaceful and political solution to the Kurdish issue will involve the lifting of the ban on the language and the incorporation of Kurdish as a subject in the curriculum. The Copenhagen criteria include the right to native-language teaching and media, and must be a non-negotiable condition for accession. Members of HADEP have also been arrested and accused of initiating the Kurdish campaign. The opening of proceedings to ban HADEP have seen increased repression of its members. In the past year, 2001, 3 245 HADEP members were arrested, over fifty-five offices were searched and shut down. Over 3 000 HADEP members were arrested on World Peace Day, and one person was even killed. Commissioner Verheugen, I challenge you to travel to South-East Turkey and talk to the thirty-seven mayors who belong to HADEP, and who receive no financial aid. The villages that were destroyed have still not yet been rebuilt. How are the thousand refugees meant to survive? Why is it that the South-East gets no money from MEDA Programme funds, even though the rules require it? Banning HADEP will be a backward step for democracy, and will set Turkey off on a march in the wrong direction on the road that leads to Europe. Along with my group, I vehemently demand that the proceedings against HADEP be abandoned at once. The Conference of Presidents has resolved to send a delegation to Turkey. Until such time as Turkey publicly speaks out against banning HADEP, any delegation must show its solidarity with HADEP and support it. We must show here and now that this House does not accept undemocratic actions! (Applause)

Madam President, Commissioner, I have just been listening to what you have been saying about the enlargement of the EU. I have heard a lot about the shortcomings of Turkey, about constitutional changes, the democratisation process and human rights.

What is the situation with regard to the rights of 25 million people who have not been mentioned in this discussion? I ask you, Commissioner, to tell us how the rights of the Kurds are affected and how you assess the political situation in Turkey as regards constitutional changes and the Kurdish question.

 Mr President, what efforts has the Turkish government made since the Helsinki Summit to guarantee human and fundamental rights, to find a peaceful solution to the Kurdish issue and to abolish the death penalty? The latest amendment to the Turkish constitution does not go far enough. The death penalty has only been partially abolished and the Kurdish language has not been recognised. Is this a genuine reform? I would answer, no. Turkey must not be given any special treatment in the enlargement process. I think that we run the risk of giving in to Turkey's wishes if we adopt the Lamassoure report as it stands. The report is guarded on a number of issues so that we leave Turkey room for manoeuvre. We must insist that a political solution be found to the Kurdish issue and that human and fundamental rights be guaranteed. The time is right for sweeping reforms. In my conversations with people on my trips to Turkey they have repeatedly expressed a wish for peace, brotherliness and freedom. I, too, carry this message in my heart and will also do all I can in the future so that one day this wish will come true.

Closer European cultural cooperation is a welcome and desirable aim. I voted for the Ruffolo report because I firmly believe that closer cultural cooperation will be mutually enriching. Familiarisation with other cultures helps nations and peoples to understand each other and fosters peace. The culture and language of the migrant communities in Europe must not go unmentioned in this context, and I call on the European Union to ensure that some of its financial aid is used to support the cultural activity of these ethnic groups. Cultural cooperation in Europe is a fundamental aspect of closer European integration. By learning about each other’s cultures, the people of our countries can undoubtedly develop a sense of European identity. I consider this particularly important, because Europe is still remote from its people, for whom it is something situated in distant Brussels. Besides its unity, Europe is also characterised by its cultural diversity. That is of inestimable value and helps peoples to live together in peace. I am determined to work for a Europe whose inhabitants do not merely coexist but, above all, engage in fruitful interaction.

I voted in favour of the Wuori report on European Union human rights policy. I welcome the call for a better EU human rights strategy towards third countries and candidate countries. Economic questions take centre stage during accession negotiations, while human rights issues are granted nowhere near the same importance. I voted against the rapporteur's Amendment No 10 because it deletes the passage calling for the Turkish government to guarantee the return of more than 3 million refugees. I have visited a number of refugee camps in south-east Turkey and seen the human misery for myself. Even human rights reports should not ignore refugees. I should also like to add, à propos
 the Wuori report, that there are not just Christian minorities in Turkey, as stated in Article 90, there are also the Yezidi, a religious community which is not recognised. On official documents such as birth certificates, instead of Yezidi, a cross is entered or they are left blank as a sign of non-recognition. Everyone has the right to worship freely and I therefore call for all religious communities in Turkey to be recognised.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every Member State has undertaken to abide by the general declaration on human rights and hence to oppose capital punishment. The death penalty violates the right to life and is degrading. According to Amnesty International, 1457 people were executed in 2000, of which 85 were executed in the USA, 1000 in China, 75 in Iran and 123 in Saudi Arabia. In Iran last week, a woman was condemned to death by stoning for adultery. It puts one in mind of the Middle Ages. This cruelty outrages and horrifies me. No death sentences have been carried out in Turkey since 1984, it is true, but people are still condemned to death. This is unacceptable, especially in a country which aspires to become a member of the EU. Turkey must abolish the death penalty before it can be accepted in the European Union. Every time a death penalty is carried out, there is a possibility that an innocent person has been executed. Such cases have occurred in the past. I am particularly concerned about the current debate in Russia on the restoration of the death penalty. Five years after the last execution, more and more people are calling for the death penalty to be reintroduced for terrorists and drug dealers. I should like to remind Russia that it undertook to abolish the death penalty when it joined the Council of Europe five years ago. Armenia and Turkey must also honour this commitment as members of the Council of Europe. The first world congress against capital punishment was held in Strasbourg in June. I welcome events such as this, which endeavour to find ways of abolishing the death penalty. I consider the death penalty to be a barbaric institution. It is cruel and inhumane. I condemn all 87 countries which still have the death penalty and call on those responsible to abolish it. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, achieving genuine equality for women and men is one of the most important social and political tasks. Women still suffer discrimination in the labour market. Women still earn less than men. Women are under-represented in senior management. Throughout Europe, unemployment is higher among women than men. Mrs Hautala's report is an important contribution to equal opportunities. However, I believe that the directive should take more aspects of women's working lives into account. The proposed reform does not go far enough. For example, it fails to provide regulations on equal employment conditions for women. Women must have equal pay for work of equal value! We need targeted re-integration measures after career breaks. I work actively to ensure that women and men have equal opportunities in every area of society. I urge the Council and the Commission to adopt measures to achieve these objectives.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the hunger strike by Turkish prisoners and their relatives has been going on for months and has cost many people their lives. The European Union must stop standing by in silence as more and more people die. The European Parliament must take a decisive stand if it is to be taken seriously as a negotiating partner. We must not be indifferent to the massive violations of human rights in Turkish prisons. We must not forget human values. The European Union must insist that human rights are respected. The Turkish parliament recently passed a law relaxing conditions of solitary confinement. Now prisoners sentenced under the anti-terrorist law are to be allowed to take part in cultural and sporting activities. My criticism of this law is that it does not allow all prisoners to take part in group activities. All prisoners must be treated equally. I cannot stand by while prisoners are tortured and maltreated in solitary confinement and exposed to the arbitrary treatment of the guards without witnesses. People in solitary confinement are totally cut off from the outside world. And yet everyone needs human contact and interaction. We urgently need to find a way of preventing further deaths. On behalf of the GUE/NGL group, I therefore call on the Turkish government and the prisoners' organisations to reach an agreement through political dialogue. Dialogue will allow a social consensus to be reached, while force will only be answered with force. My group cannot regulate Turkey's internal affairs. But we would all like to help put an end to this situation. If Turkey wants to be accepted in the European Union, it must stand up for democratic, humane values in the penal system. Human rights must apply to everyone, including prisoners. My wish is for agreement, for internal peace and for an end to hatred which opens up deep wounds. That is why we must speak out.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, almost every day we read articles in the papers about refugees stranded on the coasts of Europe. Just last Sunday, 447 Kurdish refugees landed in Greece. In February the “East Sea” freighter ran aground in St. Rafael in France with almost 1 000 Kurdish refugees, including over 300 children, on board. Their Odyssey to Europe had lasted ten days under inhumane conditions. Three women gave birth to children in these conditions. The refugees sell all their worldly possessions in order to buy a passage to Europe. That refugees are putting their lives at even greater risk is the consequence of the EU's segregation policy. It is intolerable. Europe’s borders must be open to people in need, fleeing their homeland. Why does anyone leave their homeland? Where are the refugees who willingly leave their homeland? No one leaves their homeland willingly unless they are being persecuted and fear torture and maltreatment. I think we should fight the reasons why they flee. We need an active human rights policy, we need to rethink arms exports and we need to give poor countries and regions financial aid, so that their people do not need to flee. I call on the Commission, the Council and the governments of the European Union to apply this policy and put it into practice. Europe does not just need an economic face, it also needs a human face.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for her work. I welcome the report and consider European cooperation in quality evaluation in school education to be important in this age of information. The European education systems must become attuned to the information society. Rapid scientific and technological change, together with globalisation, demand superior educational standards. We need an education system that can easily adapt to rapid developments in modern society. What constitutes a good school education these days? Is it about imparting knowledge and expertise? There is more to it than that. I believe it is the role of education in terms of the self-realisation of the individual and his or her participation in a democratic, socially just and tolerant society that is crucial to the definition of a high quality education. Young people must be given the opportunity to acquire academic and social competences at school. Everyone is entitled to a good school education, and that goes for foreign nationals and groups on the fringe of society too. They are particularly at risk of social marginalisation because they are not as well educated. I call upon the Member States of the European Union to ensure that everyone receives the same standard of education. The social divide between the informed and the uninformed must be bridged. Quality evaluation in school education is to be welcomed for two reasons. Firstly, I regard the evaluation as a way of incentivising people to improve school education, and secondly, it raises awareness of the quality dimension in education systems. The Member States of the European Union must work together in the field of quality evaluation in school education, because this is of crucial importance to labour market policy and the free movement of workers within the EU. In addition, organisations and associations working in the field of quality evaluation in school education should cooperate at European level. We need European networks so as to be able to offer mutual support and to get the external evaluation process off the ground. After all, schools, associations, and organisations can learn from one another by exchanging information and experiences and so find exemplary solutions to providing a good education. I am committed to the idea of providing a good education, as a way of preventing unemployment and social exclusion. A high-quality education is an investment in the future, for the sake of social progress, a peaceful world and tolerance.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone has the right to life and freedom under the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. All the Member States of the United Nations have committed themselves to respect that declaration. The death penalty irrevocably 

violates the right to life and is inevitably cruel, inhumane and humiliating. In the year 2000 alone, 70 people have been executed in the USA. There is a long list of countries in which the death penalty is carried out or in which death sentences are imposed, such as China, Iran and Iraq. Although no death penalties have been carried out in Turkey since 1984, over 69 people have been sentenced to death. The Turkish Parliament has the final word on carrying out this sentence and has 49 cases to deal with. This is unacceptable for a state which is seeking membership of the European Union. Turkey must abolish the death penalty if it is to be accepted into the European Union. Why have a death penalty? Since the death penalty has existed, people have unsuccessfully tried to justify the need for it. Nowadays, supporters of the death penalty chiefly use the argument that it acts as a deterrent. They maintain that the number of serious offences rises when the death penalty is abolished. There is not the least evidence of this anywhere in the world. For example, how can you explain that the murder rate in the USA, where the death penalty still exists, is considerably higher than in countries where it has been abolished? There is always the risk of an innocent person being executed – there have already been many cases in which innocent people have been sentenced to death. In particular, the death penalty is applied relatively often to the disadvantaged and to minorities. The underlying principle of the death penalty is revenge, which is inappropriate in a civilised state. Whether it is Abu-Jamal in the USA, Öçalan in Turkey or even the execution of Abdul Achmin Sabi 

in Iraq – we should condemn all of this. I regard the death sentence as a barbaric ... (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, the mother of a victim of the bombing who was interviewed on television asked "How is my child to blame?" Why should women, children and defenceless civilians always be the victims of military action? Over 32 people were killed and 40 were injured in the bombing of Kurdish villages by the Turkish military in Kendakor on 15 August. This is a bloodbath and a crime against humanity. It is a sign of the Turkish Government's attitude towards peace and towards the Kurds at a time when the Kurds had made a peaceful gesture. As a spokesperson for the Turkish Ministry for Foreign Affairs has confirmed, Turkey from time to time carries out operations against the PKK, who have now, for the third time, declared a unilateral ceasefire. I would like to know why arms are being delivered to Turkey right in the middle of the pre-accession process, and why arms factories are being built. Why were the human rights organisations and World Peace Day banned on 1 September? Is it really possible to accelerate the democratisation process using weapons and arms? The answer is no. The best way to achieve peace is a peaceful solution of the Kurdish problem and respect for human rights. Why is that mothers always have to suffer? Can we not help to foster fellowship and peace between the Kurdish and Turkish peoples? I welcome the MEDA programme, which states that all state, legal, political, cultural and social discrimination against the Kurdish population by the Turkish Government should cease. Granting EU financial aid to Turkey should be tied to solving the Kurdish problem, and this aid should be devoted to overcoming the economic and social underdevelopment of the Kurdish region. Bombing civilian populations should no longer be allowed in this century. I wish to condemn this inhumanity and want to see an end to this crime. Those guilty of such crimes should be condemned. I call on the Council and the Member States to consistently condemn the bombing of Kurdish villages and to make representations to the Turkish Government for them to start negotiations with the Kurds' democratic representatives for a political solution as soon as possible. That is the fast track into the EU.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whoever wants to join the EU must meet the Copenhagen criteria and abolish the death penalty. Including Turkey. Despite frequent promises by the Turkish Government, human rights violations continue there. I should like to list a few examples. The Kurdistan Democratic Party has been exposed to attack since 20 February. Three Kurdish mayors belonging to HADEP were arrested recently and then released but are not allowed to leave Turkey. Then the former and present leaders of HADEP, Murat Bozlak and Ahmet Turan Demir, were sentenced to three years and nine months in prison together with 18 other members of HADEP. It was maintained that HADEP was supporting and helping the PKK which has opted for peace rather than war. Akin Birdal has started serving the rest of his sentence. Thousands of Turkish troops marched into northern Iraq at the beginning of April. More than 50 000 soldiers are stationed on the border in order to fight the PKK, despite its call for peace. Why are arms being delivered to Turkey? More than 300 000 people gathered for the Navruz festival in Diyarbakir under the banner “Peace, Brotherliness and Democracy”. Having been there, my personal impression is that the people are longing for peace and democracy. The leader of the ANAP, Mr Mesut Jilmaz, said at an event in Diyarbakir, that the way to the EU was via Diyarbakir. I therefore call on the Turkish Government to respect human rights and to find a political solution to the Kurdish question. Because the only way into Europe is via the Copenhagen criteria. It will be the task of the European Commission and the Council to strengthen their commitment here. At the moment, the most important task is to advance the democratisation of Turkey, which is why I call on everyone to unite without hesitation and to reinforce democracy and peace.

 Mr President, I concur with all the speakers who have pointed out that the current changes in Turkish policy are completely inadequate. Nonetheless, as a Member of Parliament of Kurdish origin, I advocate financial aid and economic cooperation, and I also support Turkey in its integration into the European Union, on condition, however, that the Helsinki conditions be fulfilled, i.e. the question of Cyprus, the human rights issues and the Kurdish question must be settled politically, capital punishment must be completely abolished and all prisoners must receive a general amnesty. Kurdish identity must be recognised!

 Mr President, in the earthquake in Turkey, the devastating tremors within the earth brought to light the devastating situation within society. More than 15,000 people had to perish just because unscrupulous building firms, shamelessly making money out of shoddy construction, are protected by people in politics and administration up to the highest levels of government. Thus the earthquake often affected the poorest of the poor. While desperate people were digging their relatives out of the rubble with their bare hands, the state apparatus showed that it was first and foremost concerned with itself. In the Kurdish province there are 500,000 militiamen and soldiers under arms in a war, which the other side ended long ago. Meanwhile the sight of a soldier in the earthquake area with a shovel in his hand is a rare one. Ankara did not just leave people to their own devices but also confiscated aid funds and hindered the work of foreign NGOs. This culminated in the Grey Wolves, the Nationalist Action Party, demanding of the Health Minister that Turkey should reject Greek blood donations for the victims. We cannot accept such contempt for people without protest. But the fact that both the Greek and the Turkish people decided to offer each other mutual help is a positive sign. And so, after the earthquakes, both the Turkish people helped the Greeks and the Greek people helped the Turks. Please do not misunderstand me, but the industrialised nations of the West should not take the moral high ground where Turkey is concerned. They should rather at last admit their share of responsibility for the political and economic situation on the Bosphorus. Only then is the way clear for serious democratic changes in Turkey and for appropriate aid which is actually delivered to the victims. The European Union has spent thousands of Euros to assist the victims in Turkey. I therefore propose that we send a delegation to Turkey and to Greece to check whether the money has been used for the victims, whether the poorest people, the ones who really need the money, have actually received it. (Applause)

 Mr President, beyond any doubt, the enlargement of the EU by the accession of ten states is an event of historic magnitude. It is difficult to predict how history will eventually rate the first day of May in 2004. If one is to believe the politicians, the accession of the former Socialist Republics of Eastern Europe has not enlarged Europe, but completed it. Whatever our understandable and justifiable rejoicing at the fall of borders, we should not overlook the fact that many citizens of both the old and new Member States take a sceptical view of the future. Those who live in Prague or Budapest, where unemployment stands at only between 3% and 4% will take a different view of things from someone from Ostrawa in Northern Moravia, where some 30% are out of work. I have experienced celebrations that soon gave way to sober reality and disappointment, the after-effects of which are being felt in Germany to this day. In the course of negotiations, much was said about the implementation of the Copenhagen criteria, but there was no debate about the changes that bring with them grave social disparities, with poverty for the many and immense wealth for the few. Far be it from me to pour cold water on this solemn moment, but I know that there is in the long term nothing worse than self-deception, and that nothing does more political damage than the unwillingness to accept history with all its contradictions, bitterness and difficulties. This being my last speech to this House, I have a request to make. There must be no room in the European democracy for xenophobia, anti-Semitism or hatred of Communists, of whatever kind. Europe is more than the EU, and the European Union will have new neighbours. What the present time demands of us is that we be good neighbours. A week ago, I was in Riga and saw for myself just how much is required if trust in our neighbours is to grow. If we want to have a good future to look forward to in peace, then what is required of us will be peaceful communities, the bringing together of people, and coexistence in a spirit of solidarity.

 Mr President, I visited the island for talks last week. The process of EU accession has raised hopes of a solution to the conflict, but many expectations are still unfulfilled, especially among the Greek Cypriots. The fact that negotiations have been taking place in New York and Switzerland has barely been reported to citizens in the towns and villages of Cyprus. The efforts made by Secretary-General Kofi Annan merit great respect, but it is difficult to communicate 9 000 pages of treaty text to both communities on the island within a matter of weeks, and this has clearly failed due to the different political interests at stake. There are different interpretations of the plan even within the governing coalition of the Republic of Cyprus, as the statements made by the President and the coalition partners demonstrate. These different assessments cannot be ignored, Commissioner. For the reasons I have stated, there have been serious calls for the postponement of the referendum in order to gain more time for information and opinion-forming. The governing party, AKEL, which is affiliated to my group, is not opposed to the Annan Plan, but given the situation, it is deeply concerned about the possible failure of the referendum, as has already been discussed here. Now there is a need for clear signals from the EU and the UN again. We should not downplay the situation. The country has undergone a war. Northern Cyprus has been under Turkish occupation for thirty years. In view of the concerns that exist, signals on peace and security must be sent out more clearly, and with these concerns in mind, it must be made clear there are no unilateral advantages for either side. Even with the 100% that you rightly question, there is still a problem, namely that these concerns exist at all. Politics is not about finality and eternal truths – the process of German reunification has taught us that. It is about constantly evolving processes, which can be mapped out to some extent in advance but which require a pro-active and very level-headed approach at every stage. In this critical situation, the EU has an obligation, together with the United Nations, to be a reliable partner for the Republic of Cyprus, but also for the two communities, in resolving the conflict. Not only Cyprus, but Europe as a whole will be the winner if we manage to heal this wound.

 Mr President, the latest events in Kosovo show once again how fragile the peace in the Balkans is, and we must ask ourselves what the reasons are for that. Let us remind ourselves. Almost exactly five years ago, NATO began bombing Yugoslavia without declaring war. Although all the parties to the Helsinki Final Act had committed themselves to recognising the territorial status quo in Europe, the country was systematically dismembered by internal and external forces along ethnic lines; the Federal Republic of Germany led the way with its early recognition of Slovenia and Croatia. The rapid disintegration of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia did not bring an end to the conflicts, but gave rise to new tensions, which are now again exploding in bloody clashes in Kosovo. What was proclaimed five years ago as the remedy for ethnic cleansing has proved to be the opposite. Thousands of Serbian families have been driven out of a province that is still legally part of Serbia, mainly by paramilitary forces of the Kosovo Liberation Army (UCK), once classed by the US as a terrorist organisation. It also sounds very strange when Mr Solana, our High Representative, tells the remaining Serbs that they should be brave and have the courage to overcome these difficulties. Crimes are being committed, and they must be treated as such. The EU must have the courage to speak out more resolutely for a long-term, complex political solution for Kosovo and for the whole of the Balkans.

 Mr President, progress has indeed been made, but it is nevertheless an open secret that, in various accession countries, public enthusiasm for the EU has waned, and the European elections will demonstrate this. Unemployment in Central and Eastern Europe is at a lamentably high level, never before has the gulf between rich and poor been so wide, social tensions are increasing and corruption is rampant. The one-sided pressure exerted by the EU towards privatisation with the minimum possible delay has positively laid waste centres of industry in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia that were once vigorous. Social instability endangers democracy, and so the Copenhagen criteria are no longer the right instrument to deal with it. Such tendencies should be firmly brought under control and nipped in the bud. Although individual countries have been given warnings about their treatment of the Roma, it is clear that the EU must take a Community approach, or else the problem will prove unsolvable. It will not be achieved by states acting on their own. The issue with the Russian minorities in the Baltic states is a political one, one in which Moscow may well appear to be exerting influence, but which is in fact a conflict centring on education and citizens’ rights, and it demands a political solution. It is, in my view, more than a political scandal that someone like Mr Telička, who has competently guided the Czech Republic towards accession, should have public doubt cast upon his appointment as its Commissioner for having, as a young man, belonged to the Communist Party for two years or so. This is the work of the evil genius of stagnant anti-Communism, which is capable of poisoning the atmosphere not only in this House but also in the acceding states.

rapporteur
. – (DE)
 Mr President, this report is based on two Commission communications, both of which are evidence of the efforts the Commission is making to take action in the areas to which they refer, whilst not drawing a veil over the highly contradictory way in which the process is moving now that it is underway. It follows that the underlying principle – of cautious and balanced actions – is the right one. The Commission has various options in mind for the reform process, and the report makes reference to them. For the rapporteur, the most important thing is still that every orientation and every reform measure must be aimed at combating poverty, consistently and without ideological blinkers. Containing poverty, and eventually overcoming it, will be the greatest challenge facing the human race in the twenty-first century. The progress made so far is, however, modest at best, and new setbacks are constantly hindering or even nullifying it. It is for that reason that the report, like the Commission communication, discusses a wide variety of options, although there is no mistaking the different emphases and priorities adopted by the Commission and the rapporteur. Although services of general interest are the subject of controversy in the Member States of the European Union, they may, in those countries, be regarded as relatively stable, but problems are nevertheless ever-present. That is far more the case in the developing countries and will remain so for longer, for they often totter on the brink of a catastrophe. The European Union’s efforts should, above all, be devoted to supporting and motivating them. Whilst the Commission, and also several of my fellow-Members of this House, are strongly in favour of privatisation, all the experience we have had, including in the EU’s Member States, leads me to urge that, along with a responsible role for the public sector and the State, the focus should be on cooperative solutions and also the involvement of the private sector in these states. In the private business sector, priority should be given to the promotion and development of small- and medium-sized enterprises, which lay the foundation for more jobs and self-supporting economic development in developing countries. I cannot, in principle, endorse Mr Deva’s amendments. Were they to be adopted, the report would lose its critical view of things and would not be equal to the nuanced handling of the reform process that is necessary. Nor, too, are they in line with the primary tendency of the report as adopted by the committee. Finally, they do not go as far as the Commission in terms of willingness to enter into dialogue, and are incompatible with the character of the reform process. As rapporteur, I have endeavoured to propose and achieve workable solutions. Far from sticking rigidly to principles and to ideological points of view, everything should be subordinated to the great goal of the war on poverty.

 Mr President, this report definitely belongs in the list of top-quality Parliamentary topics. If only there were not such a great gulf between theory and practice, between the words and reality, we could vote to approve it. The report refers to a European Constitution that does not yet exist, and unfortunately the draft Constitution text is more focused on increased defence activities and greater ability to intervene in situations around the world than on disarmament and civil conflict resolution. The report takes up the cause of multilateralism and strengthening the role of the UN, which is right and good. It refrains, though, from criticising the aggressive unilateralism of the US, which opens the door to violence and arbitrary action. As the war on Iraq has shown, no lie is too risky for use in justifying a preventative war. Those who support the war are called yes-men; those who do not are called obstructive. This is how people seek to divide what will soon be a Union of 25 Member States. The United States’ high-handed decision to override the UN has proven a miscalculation for which the national economy is having to pay, as we are now seeing. With its calls for reform, the EU is the only constant in an ever-changing world. The EU would be well-advised to develop its relationship with the UN rather than to strengthen its ties with NATO. The report highlights the importance of development and cooperation, but should be even more specific. Instead of spending huge sums on the arms race and military operations, money should be spent on education, healthcare, economic development and the fight to eradicate poverty. If we are to weed out violence and terrorism, we need as much money as possible and more effort. (Applause)

Madam President, I would like to voice my support for the report and, at the same time, my gratitude to Mrs Sandbaek. This report sends out alarming signals and challenges us, in particular, to combat poverty and devastating diseases such as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis far more resolutely than before. My group does not underestimate the Commission’s efforts. However, the facts presented in the report tell their own story. The impacts are probably most severe in Africa. As people die, whole villages die as well. As a result of poverty and disease, vast territories are virtually depopulated, even without war. Of course, the issue today is the adoption of practical measures and programmes to control these diseases. Nonetheless, the general social context cannot be ignored. People who live in poverty have no energy to fight these deadly diseases and nor do they have the money to pay for drugs. The armies of refugees, camping in open fields or in tents, are easy prey to these pandemics. When the market is dominated by the profit motive, it is difficult to supply high-quality drugs at low prices in the developing countries. However, this is exactly where politics must accept its responsibility and do more to meet it. Regrettably, WTO conferences are aimed more at reinforcing the privileges enjoyed by major monopolies than at supplying the comprehensive and reliable services of general interest that are so urgently required. If we ignore the signals sent out by the World Social Forum now, we will hear them far beyond Mumbai. In light of this emergency, whose roots go back to the colonial era, it comes as no surprise – although it is only right and proper – that the former colonies should now demand compensation from the former colonial powers. This, as the report says, is where the EU, the Commission and this Parliament have to redouble their efforts.

 Mr President, despite the progress that has been made, our relationship with Russia still seems to be burdened with mistrust, as we have heard in this Chamber. If we are seeking integration and a peaceful Europe, we will not be able to do it without, let alone against, Russia. Russia is and will remain an important political, economic and military factor in the world. We need cooperation, not confrontation. Russia could be an even more effective strategic partner and good neighbour if the EU states would look beyond supplies of oil and natural gas and if the EU would do more to help strengthen economic and social stability, which are essential if democracy is to take shape and develop in a country. The problem of Chechnya is a serious one, but there is only a political solution and we ought to show more commitment in achieving one. If the USA has a strategic interest in maintaining tension on Russia’s southern borders, that is its own affair. It cannot be in the interests of the European Union.

 Mr Verheugen, I understand your anger with the media. I have three questions. Firstly, it was announced in the media in Poland that fifty-one complaints have been lodged, and in Parliament it is said that an iron fist is needed. Perhaps you should also use the iron fist in your area, but when the iron fist is directed against people, then it will be difficult and not just the officials will be affected. I have the impression that the social burdens in Poland will increase; the wind is blowing in the government’s face. The second question is what do you think about the regional processes in the candidate countries? In Prague there is 3% unemployment, in the industrialised area of Northern Moravia there is approximately 30%. My third point is that we want good partnerships. We have just spoken about the Roma and if we want to have a good partnership with Russia then the issue of Russian minorities in the Baltic States must be tackled with greater consistency and seriousness, without political reservation and discrimination, but rather in a way that really leads to a solution.

 Mr President, in the past, the European Union has, in matters relating to Chechnya, addressed most of its appeals for a peaceful resolution of the conflict to Russia rather than to both sides. It was only when the USA became the victim of targeted terror attacks, which Europe also feared, that we began to take a more nuanced view of the situation. Such a realistic approach is to be welcomed, and the summit with Russia should reinforce it. It seems to me, Commissioner, that the European Union will not always be able to exclude the issue of the CIS from the debate it wants on the European Common Area, but will have to face up to it. Even if one takes a critical view of the possibilities open to it in political dialogue on the resolution of the conflict with and within Russia in relation to Chechnya, the EU does have options, and we should make use of them primarily in order to provide effective aid for humanitarian purposes and for reconstruction, so that the hard-pressed people of Chechnya can get real help.

 Mr President, in all the EU’s key documents, combating poverty is held up as the primary goal of development policy. It is undisputed that the EU spends substantial sums of money on development assistance and makes every effort to conclude a variety of partnership and cooperation agreements in the different regions of the world, for both sides’ benefit. What is also undisputed is that despite all these efforts, poverty in the world has increased, especially during the last decade, and there appears to be no imminent prospect of any change in this trend. This is especially worrying in light of the fact that this rising poverty is one of the sources of terrorism. Parliament has before it a number of reports covering extremely important aspects of development policy. What is at issue is no more and no less than the use of increasingly scarce global resources. Today, wars are still being fought over oil, as in the Gulf, but violent conflicts are already emerging on the horizon over water. The USA and other industrial powers declare those areas of the developing world where there is oil and gas and other strategically important resources to be part of their sphere of interest, which apparently even gives them the right to wage war, but it is primarily among the developing countries that water is a problem – either because the resources are inadequate or because access to water is denied. There is still time to prevent the impending catastrophe with a careful strategy and targeted expenditure. Mr Lannoye’s report identifies possible constructive approaches which deserve to be given greater attention. The situation in the health sector is no less precarious. Already, in some countries of the EU, the motto seems to be that if you are poor, you die earlier, because the reforms aim to establish a two-tier system, but the situation in the developing countries is far more acute. Millions of people in Africa are dying every year of diseases capable of being treated with drugs that have existed for years in the industrialised countries. The newly-negotiated WTO compromise on the import of cheap generic drugs comes too late, for a start, and, secondly, it is so hedged about with formalities that it has doubtful prospects of success. Mrs Morgantini’s report highlights problems concerning this aspect of trade in particular. The rapporteur and, indeed, the entire Committee on Development and Cooperation are seeking to bring their experience and authority to bear in order to combat growing poverty with all its manifestations and impacts. We expect the same and more from the Council and the Commission. The twenty-first century has only just begun, yet the signs point to storms ahead rather than peaceful co-existence based on solidarity. Development policy must be redefined with greater depth and scope, and a new approach is also needed if humankind is to have any chance of life and survival on earth.

Mr President, the enlargement reports are on the table. There is much to be said about them, but unfortunately I can only deal with a few points. As far as the Czech Republic is concerned, we should understand and respect the fact that history can be seen from two perspectives and that the Potsdam Agreement was international law too. On 4 December 1989, I apologised on behalf of the Government of the German Democratic Republic to the peoples of Czechoslovakia for the events of August 1968, but at the same time I did not forget the 9 May 1945. We need vision and the courage to let wisdom prevail and to resist any inclination to do what we know to be wrong by swimming against the tide of history and creating new divisions. As for the general historical context, consideration should be given to the post-war history of the whole of Europe, not only in its political dimensions, and all of us must act in full awareness of our historical legacy. There are calls for the enlarged Union to speak with one voice. These calls are certainly warranted, but that one voice must plead for peace; it must uphold the rights of the United Nations, speak out against a new arms race and rally support for the fight against hunger and poverty in the world. The historical dimensions of the present moment are beyond dispute. What is questionable, however, is the way in which the European Union is proceeding, whether it is proving equal to the historic mission with which it has now been entrusted in fulfilment of Europe’s historical destiny and whether it is taking a sufficiently balanced approach to that mission. If it fails to do these things, the future development of the Union will be more uncertain than many people are prepared to acknowledge today.

 Mr President, the extraordinary debate has made it even more apparent how diverse are both the viewpoints on the process of enlarging the European Union and also the problems of its future form. Some things are seen as the report depicts them, but many get more critical treatment than they do in the report. Certain things were said which cannot go without criticism; when Europe's borders are at issue, anyone who simply casts doubt on everything done at Yalta and Potsdam, should know what he is doing. It is perhaps no disaster for an announcement to be made about the deferral of the deadline for accession, but elections to the European Parliament are to be held a few weeks after that, and it will be the Fifteen alone who will decide on the results of the Convention. Above all, there are reasons of form and content for deferring the deadline. The problems still to be resolved are trickier than had been assumed. So it is that Poland and other states expect support for agriculture to be reconsidered and that they will not achieve parity before 2013. Fears that a first- and second-class EU could come into being have not been dispelled. Such fears are the natural reaction to great concessions being demanded of the candidates whilst there has been little or no negotiation of the transitional periods that are required. Commissioner Verheugen has understandable complexes if he expects MEPs to digest 6 000 pages of text in order to confirm accession. We should, however, be asking ourselves what we expect of the citizens of the future EU if they have to deal with the same amount. It is incumbent on parliaments – the national parliaments and our own – to put our finger on what is wrong and demand an approach that will secure stability and equality and prevent us ending up going round in endless circles.

 Mr President, the process of enlarging the European Union by ten more States is now entering its final and decisive stage. Our group has always followed it and played its part in shaping it; we have been active in doing this, but have kept a critical mind. There are real fears that the hopes enlargement has nurtured over many years – for social improvements and an economic upturn – will not be fulfilled in precisely that way. The stertorous political utterances, heard over and over again in this Parliament, about overcoming of the division of Europe and doing away with the inheritance of Communism, block out any more sophisticated view of Europe's post-war history and, there being so many different problems in the central and eastern European states, go over people's heads. People are hardly being involved in the process at all. The process went ahead along largely administrative and technical lines and was seen by Brussels as having to do with the acceptance of the acquis communautaire. The governments of the candidate countries were sometimes not allowed to say much, and their parliaments were programmed to give approval after largely uncritical debates. The acquis communautaire, which every country is to adopt and transpose, constitutes a paper mountain of over 80 000 pages. If – as is the case – officials are scarcely able to get an overview of this, how can the public be expected to? Under such conditions, there was little chance of the debate on the future of Europe, which we are often told we should be having, really getting going, either in the Fifteen or in the candidate countries, and little desire that it should do so. That there is particularly deep-seated frustration among rural communities is no secret. If you examine the differentials resulting from enlargement after previous accessions, you cannot fail to see that parity is to come about only in 2003. Coupled with that, it is intended that the cooperative firms, alleged to be relics of the Communist command economy, should have the ground cut from under their feet by new directives designed to improve efficiency. Let me say in blunt terms that European integration will not be made to work well by means of a reheated anti-communism, which cannot do other than target a fair number of the leading politicians elected by the peoples of the candidate countries. I could name to you several good acquaintances of mine who fall into this category. It seems necessary, in view of the dangerous lack of information, that we ask as a matter of priority, what effect the European Union has on the public's everyday lives and how we are meant to discuss it with them. What is demanded of us is to talk less about transparency and democracy, and do more about them!

 Madam President, there are large parts of Mr Maaten's report with which I can agree entirely. There, are, though, a number of problems. Firstly, any consideration of Europe and Asia has to include Russia as well. All the issues touch on the interests of Russia as a great Eurasian power, as became clear only recently in the Korea issue. Both the North Korean president's journey to Siberia and the plans to build a rail link crossing North and South Korea are worthy of a great deal of attention. On the other hand, considering the problem more in the unclear light favoured by the USA, and failing to involve Russia and China to the extent they deserve, makes it difficult to achieve a peaceful and fair solution to the problems before us. Secondly, to have an Asia policy without due consideration of the Shanghai Group and its place in Eurasian political events is to ignore the realities of the situation. We must now decide on what the place of Central Asia, for example, is to be and what attitude we take towards the USA's Eurasian strategy, which envisages a new geostrategic situation in this area. The end of the Cold War saw the budding of hope for a peaceful world, and that hope is, unfortunately, waning fast. Thirdly, the States of the European Union have long disregarded or underestimated developments in Asia and are still persisting in deliberations that are one-sided and sometimes limited. The Commissioner observed that reality has overtaken the report's reference to India and Taiwan in the same breath. That I consider to be a political error that takes inadequate account of the realities. Realpolitik
 always has something to do with interests, and the EU does well to strike a balance between its own well-understood interests and those of its partners.

 I cannot share the optimistic assessment given by the report on the World Food Summit in Rome. I see the results emerging from this conference of 182 states as being rather meagre and the prospect of effectively combating hunger as a worldwide problem, as a dismal one. Little progress has been made in the intervening six years towards the objective proclaimed at the previous summit in 1996, that of reducing the number of the world's starving from 800 million to 400 million by 2015. Whilst some states have succeeded in keeping hunger within bounds, new starvation zones have come into being in other regions, for example in the former Soviet Union. The main reason for the 1996 action plan's failure to reach its target is primarily that it was founded on a neoliberal policy which entrenches the structural causes of hunger and malnutrition rather than doing away with them. It is not globalisation and market liberalisation that are needed, but rather the radical dismantling of the trade barriers erected by the North to keep out products from the South, just as much as the promotion of food production for local markets by small farmers and producers' free access to input such as water, land, woods or fishing grounds. Trade can only be a key factor in security of food provision across the world if it is not seen as a one-way street down which the big food and feedingstuff corporations may travel as they will.

Mr President, EU enlargement is entering its crucial phase. The reports before us and the speeches by Members do not draw a veil over the unresolved issues, but do endorse the candidate countries' accession. Our group also supports this position. The current state of play in the negotiations and in the adoption of the acquis communautaire implies that there are no alternatives. Yet if we look at the quality of integration and the problems arising in the EU itself, it is possible to arrive at a different view. My group, for example, does not believe it is right that, as part of the accession process, candidate countries are urged to join the NATO military alliance. This should not be part of the process, which involves accession to the EU and nothing else. The EU sets conditions for the accession candidates which are not fulfilled by many of its own Member States. There is a tremendous backlog of reform in the EU. The willingness to show solidarity in the distribution of resources is far from overwhelming, and citizens' support for accession has recently been on the wane. Ascribing these problems to ignorance and a lack of transparency is, in our opinion, too simplistic. The citizens' debate on Europe which was called for after Nice has yet to take place in any meaningful way, while the burdens associated with the pre-accession adaptation process are becoming increasingly onerous. The reports quite rightly call upon the candidate countries to adopt more rigorous anti-corruption measures. What is never mentioned, however, are the causes and sources of corruption, which is due, among other things, to capitalist privatisation and the growing social inequalities between a handful of increasingly wealthy people and the vast majority who face poverty and unemployment. The lack of impact of the Commission's strategic positions in the accession process is particularly apparent in agriculture. Anyone who warned early on that some of the elements contained in Agenda 2000 were quite unrealistic was criticised as a troublemaker, but the much-vaunted open 5% have negative and disproportionate repercussions on farmers. Yet anyone who assumes that, with the exception of agricultural policy, the process of enlarging the EU by up to ten states has been resolved is naïve, in my view. Social inequality is present to a far greater extent. There is very limited willingness to show solidarity, and in many areas, the Commission's work is much too superficial and bureaucratic to do justice to the new demands of integration. A considerable number of key issues are unresolved, and what is required is a change of direction. I hope that this will be achieved in good time.

 There is no doubt that the Madrid Summit possesses political weight, as the states assembled at it represented 870 million people and one-quarter of the UN states. The few partial successes such as the association agreement with Chile and Mexico have not made the balance sheet since the 1995 Rio Summit a convincing one; I doubt whether Madrid will, despite all its avowed intentions, achieve a breakthrough in improving the quality of relations between the EU and the Latin American and Caribbean states unless the following three issues are considered in a dispassionate and constructive way. 1. Latin America is an interesting trading partner for Europe. The German economy alone achieves a surplus of EUR 3 billion from trade with it, but the real beneficiary is the USA, which is engaged in pushing forward its geostrategic and economic interests by means of the ALCA free trade area and safeguarding them against external competition. Europe is acting to its own detriment if, by failing to speak out against this or offer alternatives to it, it consigns Latin America to domination by North American corporations and banks. 2. Nowhere more than in Latin America are the adverse consequences of untrammelled globalisation shown so blatantly, heralded by the growing pauperisation of great segments of the population, even including the middle classes, and also by the crisis in Argentina's financial system and government. The Porto Alegre World Social Forum constitutes an opposing force, whose influence is also being felt in Europe. (Statement of vote cut short in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)

 Mr President, the world has changed in recent years, and unfortunately not always in the direction of greater peace and security or more partnership and peaceful coexistence. Since the Second World War, the peoples of the world have given the UN Security Council many rights and a high degree of responsibility for security and for maintaining peace. Even if the Soviet Union no longer exists as a victorious power and as a former second superpower alongside the USA, Russia, as its successor state, is not an unimportant country. Russia has nuclear weapons, it has boundless resources, and it has played a key role in shaping European and world history in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The expanded European Union has greater scope for partnership with Russia if the residual fears stemming from the Cold War can be overcome and if, for example, economic cooperation with the candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe can be harnessed and not deliberately excluded. If we wish to move away from a policy of conflict throughout Europe we should not create new confrontational situations based on a new geographical strategy. We should instead offer Russia a genuine and practical partnership. In doing that we certainly should not treat the number of meetings and summits as some kind of yardstick. No, what we need to measure is real results. Our area of common interest is so great that cooperation and economic partnership with Russia is the only reasonable way forward, which in the long run will be of benefit to both sides and will promote security and lessen social tensions.

 Mr President, I salute the rapporteur for his efforts. Whenever the Union's relations with the People's Republic of China are assessed, economic interests are always to the fore. This is certainly understandable; after all, a market of around 1.3 billion people promises absolutely inexhaustible profits for those companies and banks active in it. China's accession to the WTO will further improve the terms for capital recovery. It will also intensify competition between Pacific economic powerhouses like Japan, Taiwan and the United States on the one hand and the EU and its Member States on the other. Everyone wants as large a slice as possible of this huge cake. This is accompanied by constant reproaches from the political side that China should have more respect for human rights. These overlook or underestimate the fact that China is trying to complement the economic reforms, which have been underway for years, with federal democratic structures, social security systems and economic regulatory mechanisms. In acceding to the WTO, China is continuing this process. Nevertheless, nobody should be under the illusion that this separation of the State and the economy will solve China's immense social problems. The much lauded market of global capitalism is – whether you like it or not – amoral and not a suitable vehicle for translating basic values such as social justice and solidarity into action. It is and remains the state which is called upon here. There is no other government in the world that bears responsibility for 1.3 billion people. Seeking to establish a multilateral dialogue with China is all well and good, but in so doing nobody should put China under pressure or only have their own interests in mind. Anyone who does put pressure on China should keep a sense of proportion, carry out a realistic assessment of their own potential to meet the same demands and have a clear idea in advance of the effects that it might have. A dialogue is only meaningful and successful if a consensus is sought in the interests of all parties. This also applies to the death penalty. It is right to call for it to be abolished, but we should be just as consistent in calling for it to be abolished in the USA. Relations with China are more than ever before of strategic political significance. Uni-dimensional development, as is currently happening on China's doorstep as a result of the USA's strategic intentions, would not be very beneficial. Instability would be the result. As the EU enlarges, indeed precisely as it undergoes this process of enlargement, it is called upon to oppose any unilateral attempts to accumulate power, and to maintain and – if necessary – establish and consolidate stability by cultivating a balanced relationship with China.

The resolution adopted by Parliament today is a step in the right direction, and we emphatically welcome it, for there is no reasonable alternative to a political solution, and the Sharon Government's present bellicose response to the terrorist attacks by Palestinian fanatics, which are contemptuous of human life, is no longer acceptable. As the resolution expressly states, Israel's military escalation offends against international law and human rights. In no way does it contribute to ending the terror, but is, rather, directed against the Palestinian civilian population and is destroying the Palestinian infrastructure. We emphatically endorse Parliament's call for the immediate implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions 1397, 1402 and 1403, and especially for the immediate withdrawal of the Israeli army from Palestinian territory 
as well as for the condemnation of the attacks against Israel by suicidal terrorists. To place Arafat, a democratically elected president, under house arrest is wholly unacceptable. We firmly welcome Parliament's expression of support for an arms embargo on Palestine and Israel, as well as its call for the Council and the Commission to consider suspending the Association Agreement between Israel and the European Union. It is, moreover, significant that Parliament is demanding free access for the media to the occupied territories and expressing its full support for Israeli, Palestinian and international organisations that are actively working for the restoration of peace in the Middle East. We unreservedly support the condemnation in Parliament's resolution of the many anti-Semitic attacks in Europe on synagogues, Jewish schools and cemeteries.

 Mr President, although the EU has already gone through several processes of enlargement in its fifty-year history, there has never been such inequality as in the present round. The acceptance of new members is not actually taking place on the consistent basis of equality and solidarity. I find the debate on the Czech Republic intolerable. Anyone who wants to examine the so-called Beneš decrees and raises issues of property cannot leave out of consideration the character in international law of the two-plus-four process involved in the union of the two German states. Anyone who wants Russia on their side, wherever they may be, had better not make any false moves over Kaliningrad. As seen from Brussels, the accession process is more than a one-way street; that is something that Mr Schulz addressed. Accession is meant to cost as little as possible even though the candidates are bound to the unconditional acceptance of obligations and payments in advance. The opening-up of markets is already turning out to mean good business for business groups, banks and insurers. Demonstrably better support was given when other countries joined – Spain being one of them. The candidates from Central and Eastern Europe have, on average, reached not even half the gross domestic product of the European Union, and the three Baltic States have only managed one-third. The level of production in some of these States is lower today than it was in 1990, which indicates that the preparatory payments have not been much use. What is required is the reshaping of the structural and cohesion policies to ensure that, in both present and future Member States, the less developed regions in general, and the border regions in particular, will receive appropriate support. We therefore need concepts that really will convince citizens of the candidate states that entering the EU is the right step for them to take, and one that will be to their benefit.

Mr President, I thank you for the commitment you demonstrated in saying, with regard to the Convention's task, that we must decide what sort of society we want and what it will demand. My question is this: is it to be that society in which everything, including social issues, is governed by the market? Or is it to be one in which social justice continues to be vigorously advocated and given form, with society itself taking its share of responsibility for it? Is the Europe of the twenty-first century to remain a Europe of solidarity, not only within the framework of the European Union itself, but also through cooperative partnership, for example with the states that will not only be joining the European Union, but are, moreover, still European, but not yet Members?

Mr President, there is no dispute that the European Union is contributing to the war on poverty, but, as we all know, we fall a long way short of our declared objectives. The removal of poverty, backwardness and ignorance must be first on the list if we are to combat terrorism. A new world economic order and a new kind of politics are on the agenda – things that were called for by the more than 60 000 participants in the Second World Social Forum in Porto Alegre. Argentina is a shocking illustration of where neoliberalism will take us. Those who want to provide really effective development aid should not close their ears to the message from Porto Alegre, but actively involve those democratic forces that are active in that forum, in the brainstorming process and in the implementation of a new politics of development.

My group supports the recommendation on the ACP/EC Partnership Agreement. We welcome the fact that the EU's relations with the ACP States have, in the meantime, achieved a high level. New areas of cooperation have been opened up by means of direct commercial exchanges under the Cotonou Agreement. This makes it all the more disconcerting that only two of the Fifteen EU States have ratified this Agreement. There is no doubt that the Agreement represents an improvement on its predecessors, because it takes the interests of the ACP States into account to a greater degree, yet we are not dealing here with real parity and equal treatment. It is dishonest of the EU, on the one hand, to demand of the ACP States efforts to develop a self-supporting economy, whilst at the same time using export subsidies to stifle early attempts at doing so. Nor, politically, are the ACP States granted the power of co-decision that is their due. The poorest countries, which need the most support and for which thoroughly worked-out approaches to cooperation and development policy are a necessity, have few if any opportunities to take part in the parliamentary assemblies of the EU and of the ACP States. I see it as particularly regrettable that the EU still has a split – not to say distorted – relationship with Cuba, a Caribbean state in relation to which it lets itself be guided more by American interests than by its own. The Belgian Presidency was keen to break the ice in relations with Cuba and to open up channels for dialogue. In doing this, it worked on the basis of three important considerations: 1. The EU and its Member States must pay closer attention to the situation in Cuba and take note of the facts in an unprejudiced way; 2. Both sides 
must acknowledge the political, parliamentary and socio-economic differences and mutually accept them in a particular way; 3. We must not go down the road of making excessive demands of each other. Certain demands are being made of Cuba that are not being met in a number of EU States. When Mr Aznar presented the programme for the Spanish Presidency, I regretted the lack of any clear commitment to continue dialogue towards the objective of concluding a partnership agreement between the EU and Cuba, if at all possible before this year is out. I am concerned that the modest progress we have achieved may be brought to nought. Mr Dalmas, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Cuba, with whom representatives of my group had talks in December last year, clearly expressed his country's hopes for a continued and more intensive dialogue with the EU, and its willingness to engage in it. Political experience tells us that it is hard to put a broken thread of conversation together again. Cuba should not be excluded from the ACP process, but constructively involved in its further development through dialogue.

Mr President, obviously the diverse manifestations of democratic resistance to the dangers of an uncontrolled expansion of the WTO's powers have given pause for thought. It seems, however, that well-intentioned appeals are not going to prevent it from going down this path. It is simply the case that trade in goods and money transactions are governed by the law of the market. The market is, by its very nature, immoral. Those who want to maintain their hold on the market have to make a profit or else they go under. The WTO has obviously set itself the goal of cutting the market off from the demands of society at large and even from parliaments. The opinions now on the table at least show an awareness of the problem. It is right to take small steps. However, far more ambitious steps must follow. We cannot wash the coat of the bear which the WTO has become without getting the animal itself wet. Our aim must be to work towards a new global economic order which distributes the wealth of this earth differently, justly and fairly, overcomes poverty, establishes and guarantees broad-based democratic cooperation giving parliaments a voice, and makes independent economic development possible for all countries. The European Parliament should do everything within its power to challenge the Council and the Commission to do this.

Madam President, G8 summits looked like becoming a routine sort of affair. That has now changed and more and more people are recognising that they are moving away from economic and financial issues and beginning to take on the role of a sort of world government. That generates mistrust and encourages rejection. We may bemoan the weaknesses of the UN, but it is accredited by the international community, as is UNCTAD, although UNCTAD appears to be in a state of enforced inertia. By contrast, the G7 or G8 have devised their own mandate, acting purely on the strength of their economic clout or clout in general, in their bid to rule the world. The neoliberal policy promoted as a result widens rather than narrows the gulf between north and south and speeds up the rate at which developing countries fall into poverty and debt. Anyone who criminalises resistance on the part of those who oppose globalisation in general – as has already happened, not that I condone violence – is guilty of hushing things up and confusing cause and effect. We should be looking for alternatives to neoliberal policies, not deploying riot police and cancelling agreements on tourism. What we need is for attention to be paid to our citizens' interests – that is what the European Union should be committing to. We should be safeguarding these interests and making sure there is no room for what is currently happening.

 Mr President, rapprochement and cooperation will only be successful if we strive for mutual respect and partnership in the Asia process. We know how much effort Parliament has put into producing this report. I should like to point out a number of facts. Firstly, the history of the 20th Century has left deep wounds in Asia which have not yet healed. The bloody suppression of the Boxer Uprising in China, the occupation of Manchuria, the Korean War and the aggression against Vietnam are all inextricably linked with the names of states which belong to the exclusive club of the great countries of this world: the USA, Germany and Japan. The EU has a peculiar way of perceiving the role and responsibility of states if, given this historical background, it wishes for example to assign Japan a kind of policeman's role in Asia. It is equally disconcerting that the EU is not distancing itself more decisively from the confrontation course which the USA is adopting, for example with its spy planes, against China. I should like to make a second point. In Asia, the future depends largely on there being harmonious relations and a balance of interests between China, India and also Russia. Any attempts to play these countries off against each other would seem to me to be very dangerous, including and even in particular for Europe! A sustainable Asian policy must be directed at partnership and constructive dialogue, and not least with the People's Republic of China. Anyone who relies now on short-term interests and gaining a quick advantage will not in the long term be able to make a decisive political contribution to establishing peace, cooperation and partnership between Europe and Asia.

Madam President, Mr President, as far as sustainability and your ambitious goals are concerned, we really are in something of a vicious circle. The forces of the market with their spontaneity and the effects of deregulation very much stand in the way of your highly ambitious goals. I have two questions. First: what do you think you can really do under these circumstances? One of your predecessors, President Delors, elaborated whole programmes on the issue of shifting modes of transport from road to rail. If you look at the situation today, however, you will see that very little has changed. Quite the contrary, in fact, the situation has worsened. We talk about alternative energy sources and yet solar energy and wind energy are hardly being promoted. The big energy companies do not want to let such things onto the grid too. Second: what form should a debate with citizens take? What do we want to talk about? About facts and figures, or also about how citizens can be involved more democratically and more actively in shaping policy? What information do they want to give us, the Members of this Parliament?

) The report underlines the importance the EU attaches to the Ukraine. It highlights the progress made in the country’s development and in the partnership between the EU and the Ukraine, but is not afraid to refer to matters of criticism. I would like to discuss three aspects. Firstly, the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1989 led to the rapid formation of sovereign independent states, a process that happened quickly, almost overnight, but which could not change the specialisation that had developed over decades or the cooperation between the various countries’ economies. Although at a different pace, the process of transformation, for which the EU also pressed, went hand in hand with social breakdown and unknown poverty for large sections of the Ukraine’s population. The EU ought to attach greater importance to dealing with this problem in its cooperation with the Ukraine. While the EU and the Member States pursued primarily market interests under the slogan of stability, little attention was paid to the cooperation established over many years between the CIS states, one might even say it was torpedoed. In its own interest, the EU should pay greater attention to this factor in future and, in its understanding of how the Ukraine fits into the world economy, should also bear in mind that other CIS states are engaged in a similar process. Secondly, the Ukraine has been given a lot of advice, and in many areas this has no doubt been legitimate and helpful. But politics is always tied up with interests. And if the shaping of partnership shows a strong tendency to benefit one particular party, then there is a problem. Partnership with the Ukraine ought to promote economic stability and social security and prevent or help to reduce tension. This is where the EU’s and the Ukraine’s real common interests lie. Thirdly, no-one will dispute that the OSCE played an important role in maintaining stability in Europe during the cold war. Both sides were involved in this process and both sides gained from it. The cold war ended ten years ago, and the OSCE should now be developed primarily into an instrument for the peaceful political resolution of conflicts. But NATO is pursuing the opposite course, basing its new strategy on strength and displays of power outside the alliance’s borders, which are steadily moving eastwards, and the EU is following in its wake. I consider involving the Ukraine, which has a long frontier with Russia, in this strategy to be a very serious matter. The Ukraine – and other CIS states as well – ought to be more closely involved than in the past in political processes for the resolution of conflicts. The OSCE would be the appropriate framework for this. With the Union acquiring new external borders, this factor will be of increasing importance not least with regard to the Ukraine.

 Mr President, I agree to a large extent with the critical comments in the report and Mr Gemelli's proposals. However, I too doubt that it will be possible to halve the number of poor people by 2015. The new-liberal policies of the northern countries, which have made the rich richer and kept the poor in the poverty trap, are also shaping development policy. The new motto ‘Everything but Arms’ sounds fine but misses the mark. First, the arsenals are so full, as the result of arms exports from industrialised countries, including Germany, that war can be waged and will be waged with the weapons already available. Secondly, it is hypocritical of the European Union to preach liberalisation of the markets as a universal panacea while bemoaning the fact that the 48 poorest countries have been allowed to export all their products to the Union duty free since the year 2000. Thirdly, I think it is cynical of rich countries – including Germany – to encourage a brain drain from developing countries, thereby pulling the rug out from under a self-perpetuating upswing. Development policy is not just altruism, it is self interest. It is striking that areas which provide raw materials are defined as areas of interest and, according to the new NATO strategy and the rules of engagement for the future EU strike force, areas of interest can also be secured using military force. If we want a new European Union for the twenty-first century, then we need a radical change in development policy.

Mr President, the report before us gives the EU carte blanche 
to establish a military intervention capacity. I regard that as unacceptable. In the early part of 1990, when it was foreseeable that the Warsaw Treaty would collapse, the Government of the German Democratic Republic which I headed adopted a new military doctrine based on freedom from nuclear weapons, on international security partnership and on gradual disarmament. Non-use of force was our principle. The end of the confrontation between the two blocs had rendered NATO superfluous. Yet instead of dissolving itself, NATO is mutating from a defensive into an offensive power and alliance and is spreading its radius of action ever further eastward. The arguments advanced today for the creation of an EU intervention force resemble those that have been put forward for the continuing existence of NATO. This move is not primarily designed to pacify trouble spots but rather to permit the use of military means to safeguard access to markets, raw materials and spheres of interest. I am in favour of the EU continuing to make peacekeeping the hallmark of its foreign and security policy and to detach itself from the apron strings of the United States. This, however, depends on a completely different set of conditions. First of all, the war that was fought against Yugoslavia in defiance of international law and the results of that war, such as the new tensions in southern Serbia, show that military force must not become a political instrument again. Secondly, NATO should be gradually winding down rather than engaging in eastward enlargement. Thirdly, a nuclear-free corridor, such as Olaf Palme once suggested, should be created from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Fourthly, the OSCE must be strengthened and endowed with enough resources for the prevention and resolution of conflicts in accordance with the fundamental principles of its security policy and not through the creation of storm troops. Fifthly, the United Nations should be asked to convene a world peace summit, at which lessons can be drawn from the wars of the twentieth century so that the peoples of this earth will be offered the prospect of a peaceful twenty-first century. Europe could set an example here, and the creation of an intervention force is surely the wrong signal for it to send.

 Mr President, the report before us points in the right direction. But it should aim further. The general public is often given the impression today that good information means being swamped with mounds of glossy brochures. However, people do not measure information by the shiny cover, but by the content, transparency and legibility. It is true that transparency and openness can help prevent corruption and the waste of resources. The latest report by the Court of Auditors shows how urgently we need changes here. Let me turn to three other aspects. Firstly, democracy is based on the participation of the citizens and is meant to be an incentive to action. But what if people are not or not adequately informed and then encounter a jungle of provisions through which not even a Member of Parliament, let alone the man in the street, could find their way? Surely information also implies that the citizens can recognise their own interests in our decisions, for instance in decisions on aid projects and so forth. Secondly, documents are often couched in the kind of language not even a lawyer can understand, let alone a citizen. Finally, so many documents are kept secret even from the Members of Parliament that many of the facts we would need in order to reach a decision remain so hidden that... (Technical disruption)

The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is an important step towards defining the general, common values of the European Union. Nonetheless, I decided to abstain for the following reasons: 1. The Charter sets out important fundamental rights. However, in its present form, it fails to do justice to the demand for social justice, as I understand it, in several important areas. It does not include the right to work or the right to housing. Similarly, the social responsibility of ownership has been left out. It has already been assumed that the Charter might form the basis for a European constitution. That makes including fundamental social rights even more important. 2. The Charter is the outcome of the work of a broad-based convention which sat in public. That is, without doubt, an improvement on how documents of such fundamental importance are usually drafted. Nonetheless, it does not substantiate the EU's claim to be a union of peoples and their citizens. If the Charter is to be an expression of the common values of the people of the European Union, those people must be given an opportunity to debate it. It should not therefore be decided and proclaimed at the Council summit in Nice; on the contrary, the summit should prompt a European debate on the Charter. That would give us a chance to restore a Europe of the people and of broad civil involvement. 3. The Charter contains some lofty claims but imposes no concomitant obligation and cannot therefore be enforced by the citizens of Europe. The citizens' Europe we are striving for must establish such recourse. For these reasons I abstained from voting during the plenary session of the European Parliament.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, budget debates ought really to be highlights of parliamentary life. I think that is still a long way from being the case, however. The Berlin Council has proceeded on the basis of an upper limit for the Budget of 1.135%. The Commission is now quoting a figure of 1.07, and the Council wants a figure of 1.05. 1.27 is really the Agenda figure. This is happening at a time when, as is well known, expenditure on the Balkans is increasing. The total quoted so far of EUR 200 million for Serbia hardly even begins to meet the real needs. Almost the same sum has already been donated to the election campaign. The NATO war destroyed too much and left too much suffering in its wake. The new political forces, which meet with this Chamber’s approval, have the task of engaging not only in political work but also in construction work and of removing the debris from the NATO war in the form of ruined factories, schools, hospitals, bridges and other structures. I would particularly emphasise that we must accept responsibility for the fate of everyone in the country, including more than 500 000 refugees in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. No other country has accepted so many refugees. Parliament is now being called upon to ensure that restraint is exercised in areas of social policy and to restrict funds for development policy at a time of increasing world poverty. This already shows that the European Union’s ability to acquire the States of Central and Eastern Europe as new members not only depends upon reforming the institutions but also – and, I think, to a very much greater extent – challenges the European Union’s ability to deliver. Unless a different budget policy is pursued, the very accession of these States will cause the poverty line to run still more deeply in Europe. What is needed are neither speeches nor explanations, but practical and social action on the part of a European Union now acting as a single unit and in which Parliament is required to make its own contribution.

 Madam President, great importance has been attached to the reform process, which deserves to be acknowledged, although this may be somewhat premature. My question is this: there is a need for reform, due not least to the accession of new countries, and thus to the enlargement of the Union. How can we – the Commission, Parliament and also the national parliaments of the applicant countries – meet this challenge more effectively, taking into account the ideas and considerations of the applicant countries? The delegations are actively engaged – as am I in my delegation for relations with the Czech Republic – but it is clear that there is often a pronounced schoolmasterish tone to our dealings with one another. How can the reform process help make the relationship and cooperation between the European Parliament, the national parliaments and also the Commission, and the work they perform together, more effective?

Mr President, the reports call to account, however they also testify to the growing inconsistency between the development policy of the Union and that of its Member States. People may say that the elimination of poverty is the common denominator but that is more of a pipedream than reality. The fact is that over the past 20 years the number of poverty-stricken people has not fallen, rather it has increased to 1.4 billion.  An honest appraisal of North-South policies cannot get away from the fact that the gulf between the richest and poorest countries has grown wider. Instead of describing this as a direct consequence of neoliberal politics, emphasis is placed on the need to define the concept of “good governance” more clearly, where development aid is concerned. Nevertheless, I ask myself what moral right or claim we have to do so, when the necessary criteria, those of democracy and rule of law, are taking a few knocks themselves in the EU Member States?   Corruption is flourishing, party coffers are being plundered, and EU funds are presumably being diverted into election campaign coffers. We need to take a long, hard look at ourselves before we are in a position to establish realistic criteria. Nor should we forget that the EU Member States are not getting closer to making 0.7% of GNP available for development aid, on the contrary, they are getting ever further away from this goal. It also seems to me to be regrettable that the report does not say a word about the arms trade – others have already mentioned this. In plying this trade, not only do the industrialised countries, in conjunction with the ruling castes in many ACP countries, stand to make huge profits, but a vicious circle is also set in train that we ought not to forget. Firstly, weapons are delivered, then violent conflict breaks out until, ultimately, troops from the states supplying the arms are deployed, and then everything starts all over again.  I would particularly like to support the observation Mr Corrie makes in his report to the effect that we have good reason to see that Cuba is given a fair hearing regarding its application to join the ACP states. The report underlines the changes that are beginning to take place there. We should not take our cue from the USA on this issue, rather we should rely on our own instincts more, and not create new and higher hurdles.  Commissioner, it is a good thing to demand and achieve coherence of policies. However, we will also create coherence if the Commission does its policy work in conjunction with Parliament, and this, to my mind, is where there are major tasks in store for us, which I intend to involve myself with.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the creation of the European single market and the deregulation of road transport in the European Union have led to an enormous growth of trade inside the Community and a substantial increase in transport between the Member States. With the accession of the new Member States, this development will substantially increase. Mr Turmes is right; in the White Paper, the Commission found that compliance with the regulations on working conditions and rest and driving times in goods transport on roads is only patchy. In addition, the Commission, in its two-year report on the implementation of Regulation 3820, has recorded a constant increase in the number of infringements. Ensuring strict application of the social regulations for road transport is not only a matter of social and competition policy, but is also of decisive significance for the safety of road transport. This is shown by the large number of accidents involving buses and lorries that are primarily attributable to failure to comply with these regulations. The purpose of the Commission proposal was to implement modernisation of the enforcement measures, qualitative improvements in reviewing and quantitative expansion of the control measures. Even in earlier debates, we agreed that a directive or regulation would make sense only if compliance with it could also be monitored. Which now are the most important changes that the Commission and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism are making relative to the currently applicable regulations? On the positive side, I would like to point out that the proposed Directive is to apply not only to employed but also to independent drivers. In addition, through the Directive, a special monitoring of small companies in industrial areas is to be introduced. The scope of the control to be carried out in industrial areas has been substantially extended, for example to the weekly driving times, the total driving times during two successive weeks, the weekly rest times and offset times. This decisively increases both the social standard and the safety of transport. In its proposal, the Commission fails to allow for what Parliament contributed in the first reading on the implementation of the rest and driving times for professional lorry drivers. The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, however, agreed to include the proposals of Parliament at the first reading in the proposal made here, in particular the definition of the driver, the range of application of the Directive and the subject of the controls. I am very well aware of the difficulties entailed by a delay in the introduction of the digital tachograph. Unfortunately, so far there are no binding undertakings from the industry to the effect that the devices will be available in sufficient numbers by the scheduled deadline. To that extent, I regard the solution of the committee as acceptable, which is to increase the control not, as originally proposed, to 3% but only to 2%, as was already found in my report on the revision of Regulation 3820, at any rate in connection with the option of a further increase of the controls on the introduction of the digital tachograph. I very much regret that a small majority of the committee did not accept the reduction that I proposed in the threshold for classification as a serious breach. The fact my fellow MEPs agreed to reduce the permitted excess of the weekly maximum working time from 20% to 10% makes it all the harder for me to understand that in respect of excesses of the maximum driving times, the rest times and cases in which the minimum rest time is not provided they did not follow the percentage reduction. There is therefore a legitimate fear that, as a result, drivers and companies will regularly be tempted not to comply with the statutory standards. For this reason, we have once again submitted the relevant motions, and I earnestly ask you to give them a majority. In conclusion, I would like to highlight our good collaboration with the rapporteur for the Committee for Employment and Social Affairs, Mrs Schroedter, in the context of the enhanced cooperation procedure. I would also like to express warm thanks to the Commission staff involved and to the secretariat of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, especially Mr Hauck, for their highly effective and helpful support. I also extend thanks to the representatives of the various trade union organisations, employers’ associations, and police authorities responsible for monitoring compliance with the social regulations, for their valuable suggestions for the practical implementation of a directive of this kind.

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the WTO conference in Cancún having been a failure, the December meeting of the WTO’s council in Geneva was a non-event, thus, once again, demonstrating that the WTO is in crisis and that the trade policies it practises are no longer sustainable. Further evidence of this is provided by the growing resistance to WTO trade policy on the part of the international social movement. The Commission plays a decisive part in the WTO’s current trade policy. Its tactical approach shows that what really matters to it is not development policy and global fair trade, but only free trade. You asked whether my group would give you a mandate to do the things you have described. To that I can only say that we will not. What would we want to give you a mandate for? For a start, it is high time that we comply with the demands of many developing countries and proceed with an evaluation of what the WTO’s policies have achieved to date. Secondly, agricultural export subsidies, which are ruining millions of farmers in the countries of the South, must be done away with once and for all. Instead of burying developing countries with European agricultural produce at prices that amount to dumping the stuff, the European Union must help these countries to develop sound internal markets and regional economic activity. Thirdly, the GATS negotiations, which will lead to massive rounds of liberalisation in areas of general-interest service provision that have so far been spared them, must be halted. This is another instance in which, instead of signalling the beginning of new rounds of liberalisation, the Commission would do better to give more attention to the evaluation of what has been achieved so far. I will give you a prediction: there will be little on the assets side of the balance sheet where quality, security of provision or price stability are concerned. Fourthly, there is no need to make changes to what we call the Singapore issues; they simply need to be swept away. Rather than endlessly extending the WTO’s competences and adding new topics for negotiation to the agenda, the outstanding tasks on the development agenda have to be dealt with. The WTO’s work must, in particular, get back to focusing on such horizontal tasks as sustainable development and public health. Fifthly, we need to subject to scrutiny the WTO’s structures and the way it works. We call for it to become democratic, with transparency in all negotiations, for all its member states to be treated as equals, and for the procedure for settling disputes to be revised. In particular, we call for the WTO to be a party to the international treaties of the UN and the ILO. (Applause)

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we had a debate in Strasbourg on the Stability and Growth Pact as long ago as 21 October 2002. Even then, I made it plain that there was no argument against limiting states’ new public indebtedness, provided that this was coupled with the requirement that growth be generated and demand stimulated. Growth and an increase in demand will not, however, be achieved by cutting wages or by longer working hours, but by taking the tax burden off the low and middle income groups, through public investment, capital-widening investment by businesses and by increasing private consumption. The decision by the eurozone finance ministers to put the Excessive Deficit Procedure against Germany and France on ice and grant these states a reprieve, allowing them until 2005 to achieve the 3% limit for new annual indebtedness is a lazy compromise, one that does not alter the false basic premise, according to which, in economically tough times, strict adherence to the 3% limit has an expansionary rather than a contractionary effect. In order to reinvigorate investment across the board, any reform of the Stability Pact must go hand in hand with more European economic, social, employment, fiscal and environmental policies. It must be possible to use loans to fund public investment, even if this does, for a period, take the deficit over the 3% limit. Such would be, in my judgment, an honest and proper course of action, without which we would lose all credibility and the same problem would rear its head in more countries every year. You may think otherwise, but my view is that we should correct mistakes rather than try to cover them up with new ones.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am somewhat amazed. You, Commissioner, have argued that we will, by means of this directive, influence transport policy towards sustainability. I would very much like to remind you what sustainability means. It was specified at Göteborg that sustainability is an equilateral triangle of the economic, the ecological and the social. Let me just ask you a simple question: in what way were you promoting sustainability when, by means of this directive, you are jeopardising safety in ports? It can make for worse damage to the environment and does nothing to improve the protection of it. In what way are you strengthening the social element when you allow self-handling, which means that the ship’s crew, who have been travelling on it for so long, now, in addition, have to load and unload it? Qualifications and the reduction of working time do not come into it. Mr Hatzidakis’ argument that new jobs will be created is crazy. I beg you, if the same jobs are done by people who already have other things to do, that reduces jobs rather than encouraging the creation of additional ones. It also goes against the Lisbon agenda if we want to achieve full employment by 2012, but keep going in the opposite direction. I have to tell you in all honesty, Commissioner, that I really would have expected you to look at these aspects from the right angle. What you said was completely one-sided, and, as you said, it indicates that you want to let liberalisation advance. If that is what you see as your objective, then it is in order for you to just say so. Then it will be perfectly clear that we can never find a common denominator, because, for you, liberalisation means nothing more than cutting costs in the economic sphere. You may well claim that it is about that, but I do not, and nor does my group. Turning to the port workers and the pilots, you have, in the course of the debate we have had – and Mr Jarzembowski knows this too – met some of our expectations, but not others. At the end, after the conciliation process, absolutely none of the people affected are on your side – none whatever! Yesterday, we were again visited by the port workers, whose 21 000 signatures make up an extraordinary amount for this occupation, and you do not even take note of it! That means, I believe, that this directive, rather than promoting safety and social standards and thereby putting competition on a single footing, is achieving the precise opposite. For that reason, we can do no other than reject it.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the collective redundancies at Genk announced by Ford are not the first of their kind and no doubt they will not be the last. They simply reflect, I believe, the current business philosophy of global enterprises. Collective redundancies are almost invariably a means of compensating for the reduction of profits as a result of diminished demand, a purely managerial and, I might add, unimaginative approach which the economic order must, as a matter of policy, counteract if increased demand is to be ensured. Looking at current policy, one can see that the cutbacks that are made in all areas of society do not stoke up demand, but, on the contrary, stifle it still further. One particular demonstration of the truth that management can secure employment strategies by means other than collective redundancies is to be found in the motor industry, in the works contracts at VW or, most recently, at Opel, which reduce working time to thirty hours and thus share out the work among more people. If current reports in the media are to be believed, though, it is evident that other, politically motivated considerations are involved in what is going on in Genk. According to these reports, at any rate, Ford is concentrating collective redundancies on locations – of which Genk is one and Cologne another – in those countries that did not acquiesce in US policy in the war on Iraq. The reason why the debate in this House today is so important is that the planned redundancies are not in line with Parliament’s resolution on the social consequences of industrial conversion – not in the way they have been thought out and not in the manner in which they are being put into effect. Let the Commission re-examine how the rules have been complied with. Redundancies on this scale are anything other than a milestone on the way to fulfilling the Lisbon Agenda and result in devastating upheavals in the regions concerned. If we really want not only to become the strongest region in economic terms by 2012, but also, as was stated at Lisbon, to create full employment, then the Commission, too, has to go about things in an entirely different way.

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism deal on a regular basis with the monitoring of how the European regional and structural policy is implemented in political and budgetary terms. In all the years in which I have been following this process, one problem has always been pre-eminent, namely that of the hesitant and delayed realisation of the various European programmes, expressed in concrete figures in the RALs. That is what Mr Pittella has elucidated in precise terms in his very fine report. Commissioner Barnier, you said that you expect the position with regard to 2003 to turn out better. It is indeed the case that a number of points show improvement, but I ask you to note that, in the year up to 20 September this year, the RALs for Objectives 1 and 2 have increased. INTERREG’s flow of appropriations is overwhelming; Objective 2’s is inadequate. Over and over again, the problems are the same. When it adopted the Berlin agenda for the period 2000-2006, the Commission made a series of changes to the planning, administration and realisation of a whole range of programmes. Today, I believe, we can already see how inadequate those changes were. Economic and social cohesion, one of the cornerstones of EU policy, is already, in an EU with fifteen Member States, exposed to severe strain, let alone what will happen in an EU of twenty-five. If we want to face up to this challenge and retain the solidarity principle, the existing rules will have to undergo fundamental changes. Taking the first of these, the economies of most of the Member States are in a crisis situation. The Member States’ budgetary discipline, as demanded by the Stability and Growth Pact, is pro-cyclical in its effects. Governments are restricted as to what they can do to fund national development programmes. Gaps are becoming apparent in their capacity to cofinance, with a consequent increase in the amounts of European funds left unused. Can we draw from this the conclusion that the Member States no longer need the money? No, we cannot. It follows that greater flexibility must be permitted in the Stability Pact both as it relates to investments and to cofinance. Secondly, although I have always been, and still am, a defender of the ‘n+2’ rule for the current planning period, I urge that it be handled in a more flexible manner, for example, that it be, in exceptional cases, deferred to ‘n+3’ or, indeed, that funds be released to those countries and regions that can guarantee that they will be applied in due time and order. Finance ministers should not be able to celebrate annual injections of billions of euros into their national economies just because EU funds have not been used within the deadlines. Thirdly, just like the rapporteur, I regard it as necessary to simplify the implementing regulations and those on the transfer of responsibility for the monitoring of funds and their use in an appropriate and flexible way. Fourthly, I should like to say what I expect the Commission’s mid-term assessment to include, particularly with a view to a detailed analysis with reference to those countries, regions and programmes that contribute to the problem with unspent funds. With the prospect of Parliamentary elections in 2004, we have to prove to the public that we are capable of using tax revenue properly, efficiently, and in a targeted way. If we fail to do so, we will have lost some of the justification for our own existence.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having seen a wide variety of serious accidents in tunnels in the European Union’s road network, discussion of how to guarantee a high standard of safety throws up, yet again, the crucial question as to the extent to which the European Union should lay down detailed and specific technical rules, or, to put it another way, how much leeway there has to be for various ways of adapting to change. Mr Rack’s compromise is the right one, and for finding it he deserves our gratitude. I do, nevertheless, have five comments to make. Firstly, and quite apart from all the flexibility involved in allocating tunnels to safety categories, it would have been desirable to lay down standardised indicators for assessing the safety of tunnels, which it might then have been sensible to use to analyse all the tunnels in the European Union, rather than only those forming part of the trans-European networks; this would have brought with it even greater added value in terms of improving safety. Such indicators would also make it possible to carry out a risk analysis or an evaluation of dangerous situations and accidents on the basis of common benchmarks. I therefore find it regrettable that the text no longer contains the Commission’s proposal on the standardised application of harmonised norms to working methods in conformity assessment bodies. Secondly, there is the closely-connected question of whether it is right that the tunnel management should, as an organisation with its own functions, also be able to be the body that investigates accidents. I do not think it should, as one cannot exclude the possibility of conflicts of interest, which would be detrimental to the maintenance of safety. Thirdly, I fully support the new ruling that, where tunnels impinge upon the territory of two Member States, joint investigating bodies are to be set up to exercise the necessary functions. Fourthly, it appears to me that, quite apart from the measures for which this report provides to impose minimum requirements for the safety of tunnels, there is a whole range of other actions that could help improve safety, and do so more simply and probably at less cost. In this I include what Mr Swoboda has already said about additional rules for tunnel users’ speed, the distance between their vehicles, the giving of particular signals, markings, and so on. My fifth point is that all the technical measures that have been proposed can have little effect when a driver is over-tired. Modern technology notwithstanding, what is ultimately crucial in road transport, as in so many other areas of society, is the human factor. I would therefore like to call upon the Council – even though it is not represented here – to deliver a final position on the Regulation on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Cancún showed, firstly, that it is quite simply unrealistic to demand that markets be opened up without taking into account the existence of serious social differences. The WTO member states start from such widely divergent positions that having the same conditions for all does not promote justice but reinforces injustice, and thus takes us away from the declared objective of fair trade rather than bringing us closer to it. Secondly, there are of course especially great differences between the industrialised and developing countries, but these blocs are far from homogeneous, any more than the European Union is a homogeneous edifice. Knowing as we do how difficult it is to get results out of the European Union, we ought to sympathise with the incomparably greater difficulties faced by a community of 148 states. Thirdly, when negotiating, we must always put ourselves in the position of the party with whom we are negotiating; that is to say, we must be prepared to make concessions to our weaker opposite numbers without expecting anything in return. If, though, we conduct negotiations as if in a bazaar – ‘you give me one thing, and I give you another’, we should not be surprised when they fail. Fourthly, we have to grasp the fact that the EU is only one of many regions in the world, and, in future, our decisions must take into account, to a much more marked degree, the effects they will have globally. To put it in other words, we need the impact of our policies to be assessed in a preventive way. The fifth thing that we learn from Cancún is that negotiations have to be conducted with more candour and transparency, enabling civil society as a whole to be involved in the whole process at the right time. Is it not paradoxical that the WTO puts up fences to keep its critics out, while its alleged mission is to tear down trade barriers for the good of the world’s population? I too was in Cancún, and I think it quite utterly unacceptable that the representatives of governments, instead of seeking dialogue with the demonstrators, barred them from the venue where the negotiations were being held. My sixth point is that the WTO needs a different organisational and decision-making structure, and should be restructured in such a way that multilateral agreements can be hammered out in a fairer and more transparent manner.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today finds us again devoting our attention to analysing the causes of the wreck of the Prestige
, and its grave and far-reaching consequences. This detailed report by Mr Sterckx, to whom many thanks for his excellent work, provides a first-rate basis on which to do this. Both the rapporteur and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism as a whole have attempted, with great care and thoroughness, to give sober and objective answers to the questions as to the causes and consequences of the disaster and the lessons to be derived from it. I lay such weight on that in view of the past political campaign waged by many Members of this House with the objective of getting Parliament to set up a committee of inquiry. I am able to say today that, despite all the differences of political opinion in the committee, our real and overriding concern was to bring the facts to light and, above all, to come to the conclusions that are needed if we are to avoid such a disaster repeating itself. It was quite remarkable how the Spanish officials, when they appeared before the committee, appeared to misread how things stood in this House and to believe that they did not need to cooperate actively with us in our work. This attitude had changed by the time of the on-the-spot visit in Galicia. The rapporteur nonetheless – and I quote from his explanatory statement – comes to the conclusion that ‘a number of fundamental points remain to be clarified or are the subject of contradictory testimony’. He also points out that various investigations into the precise cause of the disaster, and into the question of who was responsible for it, are still in progress. These observations were made in mid-June, when the report was being completed. In the meantime, several months have elapsed, and new details have become public knowledge, including the fact that the Spanish and the French consulted each other on what was to be done with the stricken vessel; the contradictions in the statements by the Spanish authorities about the quantity of oil disgorged by the wreck and the original quantity of oil that the tanker was carrying; analyses of the effects of oil pollution on the environment and initial assessments of the social and economic consequences after the summer break. These confirm what we had feared about the provisional nature and consequent inevitable incompleteness of the Sterckx report’s recommendations and conclusions. It was for this reason that my group decided to demand that the results of the inquiry be updated, and joined with the other groups in tabling the motion for the setting up of a temporary committee in this House, although we knew full well that there is little time available for this. This House’s political responsibility demands that, if we are to come to the right conclusions for the future, we must do so with the greatest possible clarity and in full knowledge of the causes, and this can only happen if we act on a joint basis, with close cooperation at national and European level. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as early as the year 2000 I expressed regret in this House that, although the poorest regions and Member States had been catching up thanks to EU support for regional development, the gap between the least and most developed regions in the Community had barely narrowed. The inequalities in regional development continue to exist. This conclusion can also be drawn from the report by Mr Mastorakis, whom I should like warmly to congratulate. Despite the best efforts of those responsible for regional policy at European and national level, the challenges that we face today in the year 2003 are not diminishing. They are becoming even greater if you consider the stagnant economy and the sharp increase in unemployment in many European countries. A very great burden is placed on economic and social cohesion even today. The enlargement of the European Union to include ten more countries from central and eastern Europe will not only increase regional disparities and thus place an even greater strain on cohesion, but, as the expiry of the current support period from 2000 to 2006 approaches, the debate on the shape of future regional policy from 2007 is also coming to the fore. In my opinion, the assessment of the criteria for measuring the development status and thus the eligibility of a region is a priority issue. Factors in regional development such as the rate of industrialisation, the level of poverty and social exclusion, the level of unemployment, the potential for research and development, the training capacity, the sustainability of development and the development of environmental protection, all need to be taken into account in the assessment alongside the present single criterion of GDP per head of the population. It is of particular concern to me, as it is to other Members from Objective 1 areas, that these special regions do not fall out of the highest support bracket because of a change in the arithmetic due to the accession of the new Member States. For them the principle should apply that they can claim the same financial support and rights to subsidies as they did before enlargement. I also support Mr Mastorakis's statement in his report about the shape of future Objective 2 areas, that is how they and the Objective 3 measures for disadvantaged groups are to be restructured, and welcome his comments on how eligibility for these measures will be determined.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that precise assessment of risks when giving credit is of crucial importance to the stability of the banking system, and so, whilst supporting the Basel II agreement’s objective of strengthening the banks’ hand in evaluating risks, we nevertheless have a number of critical observations to make. For a start, the Basel Agreement should primarily be directed at internationally active banks, which could represent a risk to the stability of the financial system worldwide. In many Member States, small local banks play an important role. There is a need to ensure that the costs imposed on these institutions by new supervisory rules remain manageable and do not lead to credit becoming more expensive. This is where the Commission has chosen a more flexible basis than did the Basel Committee, but it remains an unsatisfactory one. Secondly, nothing has been done to dispel the fears that this compromise will worsen the situation as regards the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises. The million-euro threshold is to be raised in order to prevent the cost of credit granted by small banks becoming too expensive for SMEs. It is quite incomprehensible that no detailed analysis has been presented at European level of how the new equity capital rules will affect the conditions under which SMEs raise finance. It is for that reason that we must support the rapporteur’s demand for such a study of SMEs to be presented before the proposed new directive enters into force and for its findings to be taken into account; failing that, the development motor that SMEs represent in their regions may be throttled. Thirdly, what appears highly problematic about the new equity capital regime is its effect on macroeconomic stability, as it will very probably result in procyclicality. When the economy is in a downturn, it is normal for there to be greater credit risks, so that the banks can limit their lending, hamper investment activity and consequently accentuate the downturn. This is where I believe changes need to be made to the rules, or else this needs to be examined in greater detail. The fourth point is one to which the rapporteur has already alluded. The comitology procedure that has been chosen reflects only inadequately Parliament’s concerns, as, at the end of the day, it is not clear which issues are of political principle and which are technical in nature, so that Parliament could, under certain circumstances, be prevented from making amendments at a later stage. We should therefore endorse and support the demand for a formal right of recall.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regard the referendum on 23 March as a first step in attempting to stabilise the situation in Chechnya. I also welcome the administration's efforts to make life more bearable, to gradually reopen schools, and to partially reinstate energy supplies, public transport and medical care in Grozny at least. But that is by no means enough. The Russians really need to make reconstruction a top priority. Against that background, I hope that the elections in December 2003 or March 2004 will lead to political stabilisation in Chechnya. The European Union should be prepared to provide whatever assistance is needed to hold free and fair elections. Nevertheless, I regard it as highly problematic that international organisations have still not been given free access to Chechnya in order to provide urgently needed humanitarian and medical aid. As has already been mentioned, the refugees' plight remains precarious. Humanitarian aid must not be cut, nor should refugees be forced to return against their will, unless and until the necessary conditions have been met. I am concerned that since 11 September the Council and the Commission have effectively stopped discussing the actions of the Russian army in Chechnya, which have chiefly resulted in enormous suffering amongst the civilian population. Whilst we condemn acts of heartless violence by Chechen terrorists, we also condemn the disproportionate use of military force and arbitrary acts by the Russian army. You cannot cherry-pick when it comes to human rights, and it is not by breaching human rights that the conflict will be de-escalated. If the European Union wants to help resolve the conflict, it must work with Russia and press it for further changes in its policy towards Chechnya.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse the approach taken by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which has tabled a large number of amendments to the Council’s Common Position on the new rules for public contracts. We have already had many discussions in this House which have highlighted the need to support small businesses and the self-employed, along with the need for bureaucracy in tendering procedures to be reduced at the same time as transparency and comprehensibility are increased. Further economic and social progress in the Member States will depend on the fulfilment of both these important demands. Parliament’s demand for threshold values for public contracts – depending of course on the utility involved – to be increased is absolutely justified if we want (a) to reduce the very high costs involved in tendering on a Europe-wide basis, and (b) to give small and medium-sized businesses better opportunities in the European Union. It goes without saying that this heading includes the amendments aimed at reserving 10% of the expenditure on public contracts for small and medium-sized enterprises and at increasing the threshold values in the event of authorities being parties to contracts for the work to be carried out. Commissioner Bolkestein, I really cannot see what you are getting at! I think my group, along with the others, did the right thing in emphasising the importance of invitations to tender containing conditions relating to the management of the environment and guarantees of workers’ health and safety. In principle, this is in line with the sustainability for which the Council opted in Göteborg in 2001, with the economy, ecology, and the social dimension being given equal priority. That someone should argue against that is something that I find utterly baffling. This must apply not only to the way in which the main contractors meet the specified criteria; it goes without saying that it must be binding on the sub-contractors as well. If firms do not produce evidence of how they deal with finances and with their staff, their tenders should be rejected. I do, though, have doubts about compliance with data protection provisions when contracts are put out to tender electronically. We also support the demand that enterprises or persons who have been declared bankrupt or against whom court cases are pending should be excluded from tendering for public contracts. Rather than this being merely a permitted option, there should be binding rules on this. It stands to reason that exclusion from tendering for public contracts should also be extended to enterprises that had breached the conditions of tender on previous contracts. I also ask my fellow Members of this House, when plenary votes on Article 27, to adopt the version of the text included in the Council’s Common Position, for if we do not, then 98.5 % of German collective wage agreements would be excluded as a criterion in invitations to tender, which would put German workers at a disadvantage when competing for the award of contracts.

 Mr President, Mr Lemierre, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by welcoming Mr Lemierre and his colleagues to the European Parliament, and take this opportunity to express my warm thanks to you and the Bank's staff for the extraordinarily positive cooperation which we were able to establish during the preparation of this report. The EBRD responded to me with great openness and willingness to cooperate, thus making my work on this report both interesting and informative. I was able to hold numerous discussions with representatives of the Bank as well as with project agencies from various countries, which gave me a detailed picture of the Bank's operations, its problems and successes, but also, and to a minor extent, its failures. The EBRD is unique among development banks in having a political mandate. According to this mandate, its purpose is to foster the transition towards open market–oriented economies and to promote private and entrepreneurial initiative in the Central and Eastern European countries and CIS states committed to the principles of multiparty democracy, pluralism and market economics. It is also part of the Bank's political mandate to promote, across the full range of its activities, environmentally sound and sustainable development. In my view, political guidelines governing the activities of other development banks would be desirable as well. Having scrutinised its operations, we can attest that the EBRD performs well in fulfilling its current mandate. In selecting the projects to be funded, the EBRD prefers to be involved in small and medium-sized projects rather than promoting large-scale prestige projects. It shows great willingness to take risks through its commitment to projects which other banks deem too risky, but it does not systematically seek the security of state guarantees. A key focus of its activities is developing small and medium-sized businesses. The EBRD's micro-financing projects deserve particular mention in this context. Yet its high willingness to take risks does not take place at the expense of sound business management, as is borne out by the fact that it has always received the highest rating (triple A) from international rating agencies. In my capacity as rapporteur, I would like to make a number of recommendations to the Bank, notwithstanding the positive assessment of its work overall. Although its activities focus primarily on the transitional promotion of private and public enterprise, its operations undoubtedly have macroeconomic effects. For this reason, an analysis of its operations should include economic data, which has not been the case to date. I am thinking especially of factors such as trends in employment, wages and salaries, productivity, company turnover, and so on. This will allow comparisons to be drawn between regions where the EBRD operates and regions where it does not operate, so that the influence of EBRD activities on macroeconomic development can be assessed. In this context, it should also be a stated aim of the EBRD's operations to achieve synergy effects. Pursuing an integrated approach designed to help entire value–added chains in a region can contribute to promoting regional economic and social flows, thus facilitating sustainable development, which – as already mentioned – is one of the tasks defined in the Bank's mandate. It is also, in my view, important to encourage the Bank to tailor its policies to local circumstances. Each country in which it operates has taken different decisions on its economic structures throughout the transformation process, especially as regards the division between the public and private sectors. The Bank therefore should not attempt to operate in the same way in every country. It would be a misinterpretation of the Bank's political mandate, were it to set itself up as the herald of ultra-liberalism and set itself the sole goal of promoting privatisation and uncontrolled liberalisation. It does not do so, but I want to point out that this risk must be controlled from the outset. My report is a first for the European Parliament, since it is the first time that the operations of the EBRD have been subject to scrutiny and assessment by this House. This closes a gap which marked the EBRD out from other banks, such as the EIB, which has been subject to assessment by the EP for years. In future, a report on the EBRD will be presented to the European Parliament every two years. I think that with this own-initiative report, the foundation stone has been laid for positive and continuous cooperation between the Bank and the European Parliament.

 Madam President, please allow me, at the start of today's debate, to express my sympathy for the relatives of the victims of the terrorist attack on Grozny. These crimes, which show utter contempt for human life, can never be justified and the perpetrators must be brought to justice. Nonetheless, I appeal to those affected and the Russian Government not to retaliate with similar means but to seek a peaceful solution. This attack on the civil administration clearly shows that terrorists are not interested in ending the conflict. On the contrary, their aim is the permanent destabilisation of the region. I welcome the plan to hold a referendum in Chechnya in March. This is a hopeful sign towards democracy and self–determination. Wanting to encourage the refugees in Ingushetia to return home to Chechnya is the right approach, but it is fundamentally wrong to subject them to pressure. First, the conditions for their return must be put in place. People must feel safe, and they need housing, electricity and food. The schools must be open and healthcare must be secure. The European Union is willing to get involved here and provide humanitarian aid. The Russian Government's decision not to extend the OSCE's mandate is therefore even more incomprehensible. What possible political objection can there be to monitoring respect for human rights, providing aid for refugees, and supporting conflict transformation? None, in my view, unless it is seen as intervention in a country's internal affairs rather than as an offer of help in a very difficult situation. Or perhaps the Russian Government thinks that accepting help would be a sign of weakness, which it cannot afford for political reasons. In my view, this would be a complete misapprehension, but it can be rectified. As a member of the European Parliament's ad hoc delegation on Chechnya, I am disappointed about the cancellation of our delegation visit, which had been confirmed with the Duma. I am disappointed not only because we naturally wanted to gain our own impression of the local situation – and viewed this as a contribution towards further mutual understanding – but also because a basic political question arises here which has been answered in the negative. We were informed that the reason for the postponement is the fact that Ahmed Zakayev had been released from detention in a European country and Parliament had adopted a resolution on this issue. I accept that the Duma has a different political viewpoint from our own. However, I have a fundamental question. How can one hope to achieve a peaceful resolution to highly complicated issues in Chechnya through a process of negotiation with real opponents if one is incapable of accepting that a friendly institution may have a different political opinion? Baroness Ludford, we must refrain, quite categorically, from comparing National Socialism and the persecution of the Jews by the National Socialists in Germany with any other situation. Such comparisons trivialise this monstrous, state–sanctioned violation of human rights, which was unique in history. Please do not make such comparisons again.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in which Parliament found itself when it was asked to draft this report was not a propitious one, because the Commission had drafted its proposal for this regulation without waiting for either the result of conciliation on the Working Time Directive or the Council decision on the digital tachograph. Both documents are – as Mrs de Palacio said – obviously closely related, by virtue of their content, to this report. I should like to thank Mr Andersson, who drafted the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. We had a number of preliminary discussions together. Originally an Enhanced Hughes Procedure was announced, but a few months later this was dispensed with and responsibility for the report was transferred to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. My thanks also go to the Commission staff, Mr Darmis from the committee administration, many European and national institutions, which are affected by this regulation and have played an active part in the debate, and the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups. I believe that it was this cooperation that made it possible for a number of important compromise amendments to be adopted in the committee. The regulation on the table has to take into account and interlink three different aspects. Firstly, improved road safety; secondly, social protection of workers, and thirdly, fair conditions of competition on the European Union's roads. I believe that a compromise between the groups has been successfully reached and that these three premises have been successfully integrated, although a few Members are proposing to reject the regulation. I would ask you not to comply with their wishes and instead to give the proposed draft the go-ahead. What then are the most important points on which a majority of the committee has so far been able to agree? One, the regulation applies to all drivers of vehicles carrying goods or passengers by road, regardless of whether they are employed or self-employed. Two, the regulation also applies to vehicles from third countries when they are in the territory of the European Union. Three, the Commission is instructed to table this regulation for negotiation with the contracting parties to the AETR. Four, the concept of the flexible week that has been newly introduced by the Commission has not been confirmed and instead we retain the calendar week as a basis because this is more practical and easier to monitor. Five, the concept of 'driving time' has been defined by the committee so as to create greater legal certainty. Six – this is a very important point and I hope that it will be retained – all courier and express delivery services, which have contributed to a sharp increase in accidents in the transport sector, are included in the regulation. Seven, the daily rest period has been increased from the proposed 11 hours to 12 hours, although some flexibility is possible as it can be divided into two portions, of nine plus three hours, in a limited number of cases. Eight, the Member States are obliged to define a common range of sanctions to be applied in cases of infringement of the regulation, so as to harmonise the sanctions. Nine, the number of proposed checks on compliance with the regulation has been doubled. Ten, the transport undertakings are obliged to take the steps required to acquaint themselves with the total time worked, even where drivers are employed by several employers. Eleven, the Member States have to take the necessary measures to ensure that relations between shippers, forwarding agents, main customers and subcontractors are regulated by the adoption of binding contracts which enable compliance with the regulation to be monitored. Twelve, it was possible to delete some of the very numerous exemptions and also introduce some necessary new ones, such as, for example, for vintage vehicles and vehicles for humanitarian services. Despite this considerable number of positive changes – and the ones I have mentioned are just a selection – there are also passages which I and a large proportion of my fellow Members are still not happy with. That is why several amendments have also been tabled in plenary and I would encourage you to support them. In particular they concern the permitted driving time of 56 hours per week, which is unquestionably too high, although there is also a limit of not more than 90 hours in two weeks. We are proposing a maximum weekly driving time of 45 hours, which is still considerably more than the number of hours worked in almost any other branch of employment. Secondly, I hope, like many of my fellow Members, that the number of exemptions in this regulation will be reduced still further. I know that this regulation does not fulfil all of the wishes of those affected, but I am convinced that the new legislation will increase road safety, improve the social conditions of those concerned, and that it will enable companies to do their job of providing high-quality transport services.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, far too late though it is, I of course welcome the Commission's statement of its intention to submit a Green Paper on services of general interest in the first quarter of 2003. It does, however, strike me as incomprehensible that the final conclusions and specific initiatives associated with it are to appear as long as six months later. Analyses and the demands for action resulting from them belong together. Having been called upon to do so by the Barcelona Council in March 2002, the Commission, in June of that year, adopted a new methodology for evaluating the quality of public services. You will be well aware that opinions on this are sharply divided, and I am telling you now that, in terms of its quality, this new evaluation methodology is an unmitigated disaster. In view of the invariable tendency of the debate on public services to bring forth ritual repetitions about deregulation and privatisation, it would at least be proper to conduct, in parallel with the Green Paper, a scientifically sound analysis of the situation in those markets and enterprises that have already been deregulated and privatised. There are marked distinctions to be drawn between the successes and failures in the various lines of business involved. The questions that demand answers are, firstly, whether equal rights of access are guaranteed to all citizens of the European Union, irrespective of where they live or of their levels of income. Secondly: has the cost of the service increased or fallen? Thirdly: has its quality improved or got worse? And fourthly: have the service's employees experienced an improvement or a deterioration in their social conditions? This also involves putting the service providers on an equal footing irrespective of their ownership structures. There is nothing fair about the competition if the regulations on aid put enterprises with a larger than 25 % public stake in them at a disadvantage over against their private-sector counterparts. So ‘yes’ to competition on the basis of the best services, and ‘no’ to competition on the basis of ownership!

 Mr President, Commissioner, now that the internal market is complete, our regions are obviously operating in a more competitive environment. That is why it is necessary constantly to improve European rules in this field. Since, however, the European Union does not exist in isolation from world trade, a competition system is also needed in the WTO context. If we are to take seriously the task that we set ourselves at the Gothenburg Summit, following on from the Lisbon Summit, then competition policy must not only be limited to economic conditions, but must also take into account social and environmental factors. An economy cannot be competitive if it does not have a highly skilled workforce at its disposal, if wages and salaries are so low that competition does not bolster domestic demand but chokes it, and if manufactured products carry no guarantee that they are not harmful to public health. That is why we need a change of thinking here, to transform the internal battle for subsidised locational advantages into a debate about how we can make the way people live more sustainable. Competition policy must champion the concept of equal opportunities. It will not, however, be possible to achieve equality of opportunity if technical standards are insufficiently harmonised, if Member States' tax policies differ so greatly that it is impossible to compare the actual cost burdens, and if social standards in the Member States diverge widely. I do not oppose state aid; I support it, provided that these aids have a binding legal basis that is the same for everybody and provided that they do not help to perpetuate the use of old, environmentally damaging techniques and technologies but instead promote investment for the future. In short – and this brings me back to where I started – competition policy is about creating an equilateral triangle around economic policy, social policy and the environment.

 Mr President, it was on 23 October, not even a month ago, that we discussed, here in this Parliament, the human rights situation. We all condemned the death sentences and stonings and the general way in which this inhumane Iranian regime treats its people. At that time we also expressed regret – at least my group did – that the Council had decided not to table a human rights motion on Iran at the next meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights. Now, only a short time later, someone is sentenced to death when all he has done is to urge people to think things over, not to let their opinions be decided for them and not to blindly follow religious dogmatism. In this situation the European Union is continuing to negotiate a cooperation agreement involving economic cooperation. One of the statements in the motion is inadequate in my view. It is obviously good if future cooperation agreements contain a human rights clause. But I think it would be better – and I am saying this on behalf of my group – if there were no cooperation agreements at all and if they were not even concluded while human rights are not respected. It is schizophrenic. We only have a limited number of options when it actually comes to bringing pressure to bear. We should not give up the possibility of exerting economic pressure on Iran. Of course it is positive that the students are going out onto the streets. Of course it is positive that President Khatami is saying that this verdict is unacceptable. Of course it is positive that the Speaker in the Iranian Parliament is taking the same line. But this has not come anywhere near to forcing a restructuring of Iranian society. It is no accident either, in my view, that the Iranian religious leaders and the Iranian Government intend to remove the legitimate opposition in Iran by trying to make them out to be terrorist organisations and having them all put on the corresponding list so that they will have eliminated this opposition once and for all. I think that we too have a great responsibility here. We need to take more notice of who is put on these lists and why. We should ask more questions; the European Union should not always stand to one side like a junior prison warder. That is why we are calling on the Commission to make it quite clear at the next negotiations that there will not be any cooperation with Iran, economic or otherwise, for as long as this inhumane system remains as contemptuous of human rights as it is at present.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, financial conglomerates can give rise to whole new combinations of risks, and that is something to which we must of course respond. A number of European countries, such as Great Britain and Sweden, have overall financial supervision and have already had good experience of how it works. Overall financial supervision makes it possible to deal with the same risks in the same way. That represents progress towards greater competition neutrality on the financial markets. Supervision of this kind also continues to guarantee that consumers and workers are better protected when such conglomerates collapse. Across the world, the financial markets have moved closer together. This became clear when it was via the financial markets that the American economic downturn was transported to Europe faster and with greater force than even the experts had reckoned with. What is true of economic downturns is also true of crises in the financial markets: neither is now a merely regional problem. Supervision of financial conglomerates has as its objective greater stability on the international financial and capital markets. It must, however, be borne in mind that cannot be achieved only by means of a regulation covering only the territory of the European Union. I do think that the directive will lead to discussion in the Member States as to what the ‘right way of implementation’ is, as, on many points, it makes no provision for specific rules, allowing instead wide-ranging discretion for the national supervisory authorities. It is positively dangerous for a directive primarily intended to apply to conglomerates that operate internationally to be transposed into national law in different ways from one state to another. This will involve national law on supervision imposing responsibilities on conglomerates or removing them from them, and this will affect competitiveness to a high degree. Finally, I would like to express my concern that, by sorting out questions of detail, the Supervisory Authorities' Committee will end up leaving a decisive mark on the substance of the law on supervision, and that this means that what Parliament wants becomes less important.

 Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, we have all been horrified by the pictures of the hostage-taking in Moscow, and we have to unequivocally hold fast to the fact that nothing justifies the taking of hostages. Nor is there any dispute as to the right of any state to refuse to be blackmailed by such terrorist acts and to take appropriate counter-measures. These, though, must be aimed only at the terrorists and must not make an entire people culpable. There is room for criticism of the Russian leadership's lack of candour in handling public relations after the hostages were released, with particular reference to the delay in getting medical aid for the freed hostages and the way their families were prevented from visiting them in hospital. There is also the question of why, unlike the hostages, the special forces that were sent in suffered no adverse health effects through the gas, even though they were operating without gas masks. If eyewitness reports are accurate in stating that the hostages' captors were shot while still unconscious, then that represents a flagrant breach of every system of law and must therefore be condemned. Violence can never be the solution to a problem; only peaceful means will do. That is why the Russian Government must be told that, if they, in effect, label an entire people, and its elected representatives, as terrorists, then by so doing they are depriving themselves of the last partner with whom they can even attempt to resolve this problem in a peaceful way. I believe it to be the European Union's task to support Russia and help it to get a process of negotiation going without delay.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a government that has presided over the execution of over 250 people since January 2002, including 27 since 30 September alone – the day on which negotiations were held between the EU and Iran; one which, secondly, includes a woman such as the advisor to President Khatami, a woman who has said that stoning is a legitimate and defensible method of protecting family values; thirdly, one that sentences human rights activists such as Nasser Zarafshan to years in prison – such a government deserves the label 'inhumane regime' and must be condemned in the strongest terms. I do of course endorse the material need for dialogue between the European Union and Iran. However, I simply cannot understand why negotiations on a cooperation and trade agreement between the European Union and Iran should begin on 29 October. Parliament has called on numerous occasions for cooperation agreements or financial aid to be suspended or frozen when human rights are being violated. So why are we applying this double standard? The Council decided on 22 October, just two days ago, not to table a human rights resolution on Iran at the next sitting of the UN Commission on Human Rights. I find that totally unacceptable. I cannot but wonder if the reason for not wanting to expose the Iranian Government now is that it does not square with the policy on Iraq? We in the Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left support the joint motion, although it does represent a shift from the real resolution on human rights to a composite resolution on human rights plus cooperation between the European Union and Iraq, but we think that parts of items 4 and 5 are wrong for the reasons I have mentioned and we have therefore applied for a split vote. I really would be delighted if the hope reflected by this common motion were to be fulfilled, by which I mean if an end to human rights violations in Iran were to give us cause for optimism. However, present circumstances alone give me no cause whatsoever for any such belief, which is why we must raise our voices, at any rate here in Parliament. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr Prodi, if the implementation of a policy to limit the new debts entered into by states adds up in practice to inflation-cutting measures combined with a simultaneous increase in economic growth, then there is nothing to be said against it. Here lies the crux of the situation we are in today. The best option for generating growth is to encourage demand by means of investments by governments, investments by enterprises and by private consumption. If, despite the European internal market, nation states continue to assume that they must gain for themselves advantageous positions within the European Union – and that is possible in the absence of an adequate harmonisation of economic, fiscal and social policy – then, quite simply, the fundamental conditions for sustainable growth in Europe are not there. Increased domestic demand will not be achieved by reducing wages, which diminishes purchasing power, or by increasing the tax burden on small businesses, which create more jobs and apprenticeships than anyone else, and it will not be brought about by taking so much of the tax burden off big businesses that they no longer pay anything at all. Cutting investment rates during a slowdown, even though there is no inflation of any significance, has a procyclic effect and makes no economic sense. There are marked differences between the budgets of the Member States. The fact that shadow budgets are the order of the day means that there is, even within the European Union, no comparable basis for the calculation and management of budgets. If this leads us to talk in terms of altering the Stability and Growth Pact, this must not be done because of the present complex economic situation, for that would be political opportunism; instead, discussion must be a consequence of the construct being fundamentally dysfunctional. Any reform of the Stability and Growth Pact must go hand in hand with greater coordination of European policies on the economy, social affairs, employment, tax and the environment, if there is to be any real upturn in investment.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to begin my statement on the Commission proposal with a word of congratulations to Commissioner Barnier and his colleagues on the way that the presentation of the proposal for a regulation on the setting up of the Solidarity Fund has actually been very quick. By doing this, the Commission has in fact done its bit to meet the expectations of the citizens in the European Union's disaster areas for prompt aid. At the same time, I of course want to give my support to the discussion here in Parliament being a matter of urgency, and I expect the Council to go ahead with its project of direct dialogue to deal with Parliament's amendments to the Commission's draft. This would make it possible to actually make a start on allocating resources from the Fund with effect from 1 November, following adoption by the General Council on 21 October. I think this is virtually a world record for these three European institutions to get something from conception to realisation in such a short time. This is unmistakeably and tangibly symbolic of European solidarity. My group gives its support to the extension of the applicability of the Fund's resources to major disasters in accordance with the amendment brought in by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and is in consequence opposed to the Council's preference for concentrating on natural disasters. In the same way, as my fellow Members have already said, we are also, as a group, in favour of applying them to damage in excess of EUR 1 billion or 0.5% of GDP, 50% to be paid out at once, a three-month deadline for submission of applications, and the possibility of derogations for regions that are particularly severely affected. I would, though like to express my regret that, as the Fund is to be what one might term a fund with virtual money, it is not to be possible to transfer resources unused in one year to the following year and thus to accumulate them. To do so would have given us a more flexible instrument for giving as much help as possible to citizens, businesses and institutions affected even by major disasters.

 Mr President, Commissioner, following the success of international action to save the life of Safiya Husseini in March this year, it is all the more shocking to again be faced with the threatened execution of a Nigerian woman and mother by being stoned to death. Despite international pressure, the Nigerian Government is not willing to meet its obligations under international law and is allowing 10 Nigerian federal states to apply local and religiously motivated criminal law contrary to national constitutional law and international human rights. At the same time, however, we need to be aware that Nigeria is by no means a unique case. According to information from Amnesty International, in Iran, for example, in 2001 and 2002 at least six women were sentenced to death by stoning for crimes such as ‘adultery and earthly depravity’, in some cases after a long prison sentence, and these sentences were carried out. In Iran alone a total of 35 people, both men and women, have already been executed this year in various ways. It is therefore high time that the European Union took a stand against this barbaric practice not just in individual cases, but as a matter of principle. It should also be possible to endeavour to impose sanctions on regimes where practices of this kind take place. (Applause)

 I voted in favour of the Berenguer Fuster report, as I, like the rapporteur, support the Commission's approach to reforming the system of employment aid. I particularly welcome the way in which the planned limitation of the prior notification requirement now gives regional authorities more scope to develop local employment programmes, thus enabling them to respond quickly and flexibly, with targeted measures, to changed conditions in the labour market in the regions. It is in particular small and medium-sized enterprises that will benefit from the more lenient conditions, being able, where the need arises, to expect the speedy and straightforward payment of aid, which I emphatically support. The consolidation in a single text of current legislation on employment aid means that the Commission is also doing justice to its objective of greater transparency in the EU's lawmaking processes. There is one point, though, in the rapporteur's argument where he and I part company. The key to improving employment cannot be found in the greater labour-market flexibility for which he calls. It is far more a matter of responding to the changed situation in the labour market by rethinking employment policy, for example by using new working arrangements to guarantee full employment while simultaneously safeguarding quality jobs.

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is beyond doubt that the airspace above the European Union should be under common management if its safe use and greater quality is to be guaranteed in the form of reduced delays. The approach taken by the rapporteurs, of involving representatives of consumer associations and of industry, as well as of Eurocontrol and of the armed forces, in the discussion in order to come to decisions on proposals for the use of the Single Sky, is one that I support. Only this combination, taking account of the experience of civilian and military operators, of suppliers, of those who provide air transport services and those who use them, can lead to decisions being made that effectively make the connection between the required safety standard, efficiency, and the interests of the workforce. I do have doubts, though, when it comes to the technical implementation that is proposed. I can understand why service providers and regulators are to be separated, but I am opposed to the option contemplated of destroying the hitherto integrated air traffic control system by awarding individual contracts, some of them to operators in the private sector. Whilst this may well lead to more competitors becoming active in the market, I see it as bringing about the very opposite of the increased safety that is intended. The geographical fragmentation of air traffic control services that prevails at present gives way only to fragmentation of an economic kind. In no way does this reduce the existing problems in European air transport, but rather – as demonstrated by the example of the recent crash of two aircraft over Lake Constance – new ones are added. Considerations of profitability led to cutbacks in personnel that made it possible for a situation to arise in which in fact only one pilot was actually on duty, and this made trouble-free and, above all, safe operation impossible. Here, it is abundantly clear, the question arises of whether air traffic management's highly-sensitive safety issues might not be better taken care of by a public service, which would incorporate the advantages of the integration of the individual services into one single chain with the required quality of work, professional qualifications and the necessary material resources. Whilst the introduction of cross-border blocks of airspace represents a step towards the necessary integration of European airspace, it can only come about with the agreement of all the States concerned. When cases of uncertainty or dispute arise, it should not be possible to settle them over the heads of one or more states. In contrast to this Commission proposal, which presupposes cross-border cooperation by regional services that are available only to a very limited extent, close collaboration between the nation states' existing public air traffic control services is very definitely conceivable and indeed realistic. In this instance, two countries would constitute a cross-border block of airspace. This complex question of how the sovereignty of states may be respected is also apparent in the Commission's thinking and reporting on improved collaboration between civil and military use of airspace. It is not clear from these reports precisely how the closure of airspace to civil, as opposed to military, aviation can be rolled back. The current regulations can hardly be said to achieve better use of the single European airspace or greater safety. The extended interoperability of the European air traffic management network can be seen in a positive light, as integrated networks have a natural tendency to facilitate greater compatibility and contribute to the reduction of acquisition and maintenance costs.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Commissioner, Commissioners, my group welcomes the discussion on the measures required at European level to cope with the unparalleled damage wrought by the disastrous floods in the Federal Republic of Germany, in Austria, in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia. I would like to again express our dismay and our grief over the victims and express our sympathy to their families. The immense material damage and the destitution of thousands of people call for extensive and coordinated aid on the part of the European, national and regional forces and institutions. The members of the public, communities, businesses and faring installations that have been affected expect the European institutions to provide immediate and tangible aid to alleviate their need and also to deal with the extensive consequences of the emergency. The European Union can do a great deal to polish up its image and reputation in the eyes of the public by acting speedily and without bureaucracy. The remarkable wave of solidarity and unselfish mutual assistance that showed itself in the struggle against the floodwaters, must be supplemented by clear and substantial indications of the European Union's solidarity. The Commission has taken the right step in proposing the possible reallocation of European resources within the European funds, but this is not sufficient. Alongside the Community Disaster Fund, which the Commission has proposed and which will mobilise aid money in the long term, there is a need for emergency aid supplied from the margin of as yet unused European budget resources. Over and above that, we propose that, in the event of disasters, it should be possible to examine the legal option of reducing the share of national cofinancing, at the same time suspending the putting of contracts out to tender in order to mobilise local and regional enterprises. This would make an effective contribution to supporting and promoting small and medium-sized enterprises in the region or local area affected by the calamity. We welcome the European Investment Bank's initiative, under which EUR 1 billion is to be made available in the first instance for the purpose of granting credits under special conditions, with the option of topping them up at a later date. Making these interest-free would be a greater help to the recipients. This brings us to the proposal that the European Union, using a specially created fund, could take on the cost of the interest incurred. I would like to point out by way of conclusion that these disastrous floods are not an isolated and extreme natural occurrence; the incidence of natural disasters in various parts of the world is increasing. For us, this should be – indeed must be – a clear warning signal, calling on us to give environmental issues, in all relevant areas of Community policy, a far higher priority than we have done to date.

 Mr President, Commissioner, this report by Mr Savary on restrictions for heavy goods vehicles is one with which I am in complete agreement. It is a good compromise, and one that I support. For a start, the Member States can impose restrictions on heavy goods vehicles within the time-spans that have now become customary, namely Saturday, Sunday and national public holidays. Secondly, the scope envisaged has been chosen on the principle that there should be no discrimination between domestic and cross-border traffic. The directive governs only cross-border traffic on the trans-European transport networks, the Member States having the right to enact legislation to impose additional limits on domestic traffic using the road network as a whole. Thirdly, and in addition to the derogations under ordinary law, the national authorities have a margin for manoeuvre to enact supplementary derogations for the trans-European transport networks used for cross-border transport of goods. Fourthly, sanctions and the monitoring of the system of restrictions remain a matter for the national authorities. The rapporteur has, among other things, taken on board two important amendments. The first of these has to do with the creation of a European apparatus for road traffic information, and the second with the extension of the derogation to flowers and fresh horticultural products. On this very important point, Mr Ferber, our opinions differ. Adoption of this directive will create legal certainty, so that different arguments will no longer be able to be brought before different courts. Road safety will be enhanced, and the detriment to people and nature will be minimised. Member States that already take a more liberal approach will not be compelled to introduce more restrictive measures, and those with tighter restrictions on convoys of heavy goods vehicles will not be forced to liberalise them.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Petersen, Commissioner, to put it briefly and to bring matters down to a common denominator, I consider one single commitment by the automobile industry to the protection of pedestrians to be utterly inadequate. This is all the more the case in view of the dramatic incidence of serious traffic accidents which make it impossible to regard as appropriate the deadlines envisaged for implementing the recommendations regarding impacts involving the lower leg and head with the front or windscreen of the vehicle: 1 July 2005 for all new vehicle types, 1 July 2010 for 80% of new vehicles and 2012 for all new vehicles. I do not want to be misunderstood. I am not, as a matter of principle, opposed to commitments in general, but in this specific case I see it as necessary to produce a binding framework directive. That would be a preferable way of going about it. Mrs Hedkvist Petersen's report reflects this problem. Attempts have been made at negotiating a compromise, but, unfortunately and apart from any compromise, a whole array of shortcomings remain. You, Mr Koch, looked only at the positive side of that; I am now considering it from another angle. Excessive delays prior to the commitment's implementation, the reduction of tests from four to two, the commitment to equip vehicles with daytime running lights, the provision that the implementation of phase 2 should be subject to technical feasibility, which gives no guarantee that the objectives will actually be achieved, the failure to adopt a ban on fitting front and rear bullbars after a vehicle is purchased. We of course support the equipping of all vehicles with ABS, as we do the introduction of a range of electronic active safety devices. Making the first move is always better than doing nothing. This one can help cut down on accidents. So, despite all my reservations, I will vote for this report.

 My group supports Mrs Sommer's report, as it takes up the specific problem of the situation which will face 33 million people living in 23 of the European Union's border regions after the accession of the central and eastern European countries. We are also glad that a range of proposals submitted by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left have been incorporated into the report, for example the emphasis on the need to provide more funds to promote SMEs, and the call for an increase in the EU share in co-finance in order to take account of the calamitous gaps in terms of development. We share the rapporteur's fundamental conviction that the EUR 195 million in funding allocated by the Commission are far from adequate, and we support to the utmost the demand for additional financial resources. This is all the more the case as the funds currently available are being found by means of reallocations, whilst at the same time the finance ministers of various countries can look forward to billions from the resources of the Structural and Regional Funds not being utilised and therefore being refunded. We regret the fact that it has not been possible to bring about the acceptance of a legal basis specifically for the promotion of border regions, without which the longer-term funding of measures will be impossible. By way of contrast, we welcome the orientation towards dealing more effectively with the connection of the regional transport systems to the Trans-European Networks.

 My group supports the report by Mr Turco, who has done good work. The Structural and Cohesion Funds are European Union instruments of extreme importance for bringing the EU's less-favoured regions up to the level of development of the prosperous ones. We take the view that these instruments of European incentive policy enable EU policy to have the greatest direct and visible effects on people's quality of life and must therefore at all costs remain part of future policy after enlargement. Support given by stronger regions to the weaker ones, in a spirit of solidarity and without reference to national boundaries, is symbolic of European unity. We therefore oppose any discussion of even the partial renationalisation of regional and structural policy, as this would undermine the principle of solidarity and it is not foreseeable where such a policy might lead. We are of course aware of the serious problems involved in realising structural and regional policy, and see the Commission and the Member States as sharing responsibility. The poor implementation rates and constantly increasing backlogs, totalling – incredibly – EUR 112 billion in 2000, give grave cause to consider the possibility of a radical re-examination of the procedures and structures that have been in place to date.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, coal will continue to play an important role in energy provision for the foreseeable future. On that point I am at one with the Commission, even though the relative amount of energy produced from coal has become very small in comparison with other primary energy sources. I even think that the Commission should have made even more emphatic reference to hitherto unused capacity to derive energy from coal, as greater effectiveness can be achieved through improved technical procedures, especially combined heat and power. If we – as is indeed only right – include indigenous primary energy sources and thus also coal in the European strategy for security of energy supply, this inevitably leads, in the case of coal, to the requirement that the Member States should have the right to grant aid in this sector, as Community coal production is made uncompetitive by geological conditions and environmental and social standards in the EU. This means that the classes of aid proposed by the Commission – operating aid, closure aid and help with meeting inherited liabilities – are sensible and necessary, although there might very well be different opinions about the period for which this regulation is to run. What I find regrettable about the Commission proposal, in view of the imminent enlargement of the European Union, is that it does not include the coal-producing acceding countries in its scope with effect from the date they join, which is indispensable, and the periods for which the regulation is to run are far too short for these countries to be able to carry out the necessary and painful restructuring of coal mining in, for example, Poland and the Czech Republic. Poland, in any case, produces more coal than the whole of the European Union put together, totalling 102 million tonnes in 2000 over against the EU's 85 million tonnes. There is a need to catch up here. My group supports the Commission proposal.

Economic growth in the EU as a whole fell to 1.6% in 2001 (compared with 3.3% in 2000), the unemployment rate remained more or less stable at 7.7% in December 2001, compared with 7.9% in December 2000, the rate of inflation rose from 2.1% in December 2001 to 2.5% in January 2002 with the introduction of the euro and the ratio of investment to European GDP is far lower than that required for sustainable growth. Instead of public investment, a radical employment policy programme and meaningful concepts to guarantee health care and pensions, the rapporteur calls for strict compliance with the stability and convergence pact as an end in itself. His proposals for achieving this are as old as they are misguided: he calls for expenditure to be capped (naturally with social transfer benefits as the main source of savings) instead of calling for improvements on the income side and he calls for wage restraint at a time when wages are generally falling in real terms and transnational groups are making a killing and often do not even have to pay any tax. How is this sort of strategy expected to force demand? I cannot vote in favour of such a report.

 Mr President, we have, in the European Union, an internal market, and a unitary currency in twelve of its Member States, but we do not have a communitarised European economic and fiscal policy and nor do we have a policy on employment. This is our fundamental dilemma. Opinions will differ to a marked degree as regards the Guidelines. If we make growth our priority, we can discuss whether or not it presupposes a high rate of employment, which makes for greater purchasing power and hence strengthens domestic demand. We can discuss whether to roll back supply-side economic policies a bit in favour of those that are demand-driven, but we will not solve the problem if we do not sort out communitarised policies. The Member States are jostling for position among themselves, which means that a common framework needs to be laid down, at any rate to provide guidelines for economic policy. How much can or should be budgeted for expenditure on investments? Is it really necessary – as is stated in the text – to prioritise the reduction of outgoings, or can we not change the revenue side by means of tax justice? Why does tax law not treat partnerships and corporate enterprises equally? Why is it that not every business or private individual pays tax on the profits it or they make? It is frameworks such as these that we can lay down and thereby enable there to be a level playing field in every country. The question we have to ask ourselves – which I think Mr Karas framed in an improper way – is not to do with the Left wanting to engage in social policy as against economic policy or to oppose employment with stability. Good employment policy and low unemployment are merely the precondition for growth actually being achieved. We get growth only if the products that are manufactured are capable of being sold. That means that the two are linked together. That is why we have to give some thought to how to fit economic and social policies together much better, rather than setting them up in opposition to each other. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I very much welcome this debate, because since 11 September the need to fight terrorism has been cited as justification for nearly every military intervention. This is also true of the situation in Chechnya. A change of thinking is required. Conflicts and terrorism cannot be resolved by military means. I was pleased to see in yesterday's debate on the Middle East that this is also the unanimous opinion of this Parliament. In the case of Chechnya, as in all other crisis areas, the only things that will lead to a solution to the problems are negotiations, a willingness to compromise, confidence-building, the development of civil society and the rule of law, and reconstruction. The dialogue with Russia about these problems definitely needs to be stepped up. We should press for the Russian Government to continue and intensify the contacts it began in November with Mr Maskhadov and other Chechens who are ready to talk. The judicious proposals of a Council of Europe working group, in which members of the Duma are also represented, have got these initiatives for a comprehensive Russian-Chechen dialogue off the ground. We should support this. The human rights situation in Chechnya remains critical. I welcome the fact that Parliament has drawn attention to these points in its compromise motion. In my view, we should criticise the sluggish progress being made on prosecuting perpetrators of human rights offences and sentencing those who are found guilty of such crimes, despite the fact that President Putin claimed otherwise yesterday. It is positive, however, that the Russian Government has taken the first steps towards rebuilding the country and restoring normality to everyday life. I would refer in particular to the efforts that they have made to build up the civil administration, the judicial system and the local police force. I do not think that it is fair for us to call into question or reject everything that the Russian side says a priori. We need to trust both sides. Because the only basis for being able to talk to each other at all is mutual trust. The Commission should support this development by providing more funds. To get an idea of what is needed we should finally implement our own decision of the year 2000 and send an ad hoc delegation to Chechnya. (Applause)

The resolution adopted by Parliament today is a step in the right direction, and we emphatically welcome it, for there is no reasonable alternative to a political solution, and the Sharon Government's present bellicose response to the terrorist attacks by Palestinian fanatics, which are contemptuous of human life, is no longer acceptable. As the resolution expressly states, Israel's military escalation offends against international law and human rights. In no way does it contribute to ending the terror, but is, rather, directed against the Palestinian civilian population and is destroying the Palestinian infrastructure. We emphatically endorse Parliament's call for the immediate implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions 1397, 1402 and 1403, and especially for the immediate withdrawal of the Israeli army from Palestinian territory 
as well as for the condemnation of the attacks against Israel by suicidal terrorists. To place Arafat, a democratically elected president, under house arrest is wholly unacceptable. We firmly welcome Parliament's expression of support for an arms embargo on Palestine and Israel, as well as its call for the Council and the Commission to consider suspending the Association Agreement between Israel and the European Union. It is, moreover, significant that Parliament is demanding free access for the media to the occupied territories and expressing its full support for Israeli, Palestinian and international organisations that are actively working for the restoration of peace in the Middle East. We unreservedly support the condemnation in Parliament's resolution of the many anti-Semitic attacks in Europe on synagogues, Jewish schools and cemeteries.

 Mr President, I would like to follow on from what Mr Karas has said, and refer to a level competitive playing field. Yes, we certainly have an internal market, but we also have 15 sets of national circumstances within this internal market. So there is not a level competitive playing field. For example, there is not a level playing field between large companies and SMEs, because there are already wide differences in taxation between them, nor is there a level playing field between companies that operate globally and those that operate at regional level. There is not a level playing field when you consider the system of taxes and charges in the Member States and how market access is guaranteed. When we talk about wanting to become the most dynamic economic region in the world, that means that we have to increase our economic power. In a nutshell, that means that we either have to rationalise, which is in the economic interest of individual companies, but not in our macroeconomic interest, as it of course involves job losses, or else we can increase turnover. If we want to increase turnover, we need a market – we need customers. Customers who must have money. That means that we have to increase demand. Demand must come from both public and private investment. That means that people must obtain sufficient income from paid employment, if they are to be in a position to buy products in the first place. It is no good having the very best, most well-designed, most durable and most keenly priced product if there are no customers who can pay for it. I therefore simply believe that the contrast that is constantly made between economic policy and social policy is simply wrong. Mr Radwan, you said that the best economic policy is simultaneously also the best social policy. I would also like to turn that round: a good social policy is also a good economic policy. I say that because there is a common denominator here, which is why investments have to be taken into account. As I see it, education is not a form of consumption, but an investment in the future, because we have to develop new products. To do that, we need a skilled workforce. And that has to be built into this whole framework of investment activity.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr President of the Commission, I wish to limit myself to speaking about Mr Karas' report. Firstly, it is to be welcomed that a distinction is drawn between actual economic consequences of 11 September and political and economic deficiencies that preceded them by some considerable time. It goes without saying that the European Union must allow Member States to support enterprises with serious problems that really are attributable to the consequences of the attack, in order to alleviate or prevent adverse effects on their employees, whether these effects are direct and commercial or are associated with these and of a social nature. Secondly, though, it is irresponsible for enterprises to take steps to rationalise – in other words, cut jobs – out of hand, and unjustifiably defend this by reference to the events of 11 September. It would in fact be nonsensical and damaging to use State aid to intervene in such situations. Thirdly, the assertion that the European Central Bank's cutting of interest rates and the introduction of the euro in Europe could nip an international financial crisis in the bud, is one that I consider incapable of being proven. Fourthly, additional adverse consequences for the economic situation, such as the rapporteur fears, might be brought about by increased expenditure on the armed forces and on internal security, can be drastically minimised by a sensible policy of development, which would focus on removing such causes of terrorism as poverty, oppression, exploitation and cultural intolerance.

 I consider the establishment of a European satellite navigation programme to be generally sensible and deserving of support. I have, despite this, voted against the Glante report today, as I am unable to follow the rapporteur down the road he is taking. In no way is there any certainty that Galileo will succeed in economic terms as a competitor to GPS, which has until now enjoyed a monopoly of the market. I therefore take the view that the financial risk should be borne equally by the public sector and private enterprise. The rapporteur wants to facilitate industry's involvement in financing Galileo by means of a development company instead of giving it a share in the Joint Undertaking, as the Commission had planned. One objective in this is to allay the Member States' misgivings on the security policy front, and the other is to avoid the private businesses which constitute part of the Joint Undertaking enjoying competitive advantages when tenders are invited to set Galileo up and operate it. I take the view, however, that the end result of this purely optional solution to financial participation will be that the investments Galileo will need will be raised by the public sector alone. Industry will get on board only when Galileo has demonstrated its earning potential and is set to make profits. This would boil down to funds raised by taxation being invested as venture capital and to substantial shares in the profits then being handed over to private enterprise. That is not how I envisage taxpayers' money being handled. Nor am I convinced by the argument of possible conflicts of interest in tendering procedures. It is, for example, the usual practice in municipalities for enterprises owned by the local authority to tender jointly with private firms when contracts are put out, without this resulting in unequal treatment. As regards the argument of security policy, I have misgivings of a quite different kind. Both the Commission and the Council leave no room for doubt that they regard Galileo as a central component of the independence of European defence policy. Parliament has not been able to make up its mind to decisively reject the use of Galileo for military purposes. I, though, reject all use of satellite navigation systems for military purposes.

 My group agrees with Mr Pohjamo's own-initiative report. Positive effects have not yet been forthcoming, to the extent we had hoped, from the current provisions of the law and from the reform of the structural funds within the Agenda 2000 framework. The following, in particular, need to be optimised: - the lengthy negotiations on programmes between the Commission and the Member States - the complicated financial provisions - the involvement of the regions in the implementation of programmes and projects - the expenditure on administration, and - the non-binding nature of the monitoring of project implementation. Unless further structural changes are made in the administration of the Structural Funds, it will continue to be scarcely possible to resolve the problem posed by the decrease in disparities between the Member States not being reflected by a decrease in those between the regions within them. Such changes must, in particular, cover the following aspects: - time limits on projects - discontinuance of the financing of projects, the realisation of which overruns the timescale envisaged - the redistribution of Structural Funds resources from countries not availing themselves of them to those which have submitted sufficient qualifying projects - greater weight to be given to infrastructure projects which promote employment. Enlargement of the EU makes it a matter of urgent necessity that the Commission should produce, by 2003 at the latest, definite proposals to guarantee that present Member States should suffer no detriment as regards structural resources and that the countries that are candidates for accession should be treated equally in line with the tasks of a common structural policy. There is no other way to achieve the objective of long-term reduction of existing differences in levels of development and the consequent enhancement of economic and social cohesion. The amendments tabled by my group have also supported this statement of political objectives.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unlike Mrs Schroedter, I regard the final result of the Committee's vote on Mr Musotto's report as a success. The report demonstrates, firstly, a balanced assessment of the disparities within the European Union, which continue to be marked, secondly, the challenge thrown down by enlargement, and thirdly, the need for improvements in the area of the EU's structural and cohesion policies. I would very much like to highlight four fundamental points. The first is that there must be no renationalisation of Structural Fund policy. I can save myself the effort of justifying this, as Mr Duin has already done that for me. Secondly, a polycentric model of space would be a sensible approach to counteracting the disparity between the centre and the periphery. Thirdly, there is a need for improved coordination among the Structural Funds as well as of structural policy with the other Community policy areas, especially the common agricultural policy and fiscal and economic policy. Fourthly, consistent application of the bottom-up and partnership principles at every stage – planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation would not only promote closeness to the citizens, but also the subsidiarity principle. What is imperative, quite apart from the need to continue with aid for the underdeveloped regions of the present Member States, is that the soon-to-be Member States of the European Union must enjoy our full solidarity with them, which means the involvement of these countries, with equal rights, in EU structural policy, without allowing the present Member States to fall by the wayside. Serious shortfalls in development make it, in my view, already perfectly clear that even 0.45% of Europe's GDP will not be sufficient to do this. Provision of support and transnational cooperation in the border regions will be of great significance as enlargement takes its course. Justice has not, in my judgement, been adequately done to this in the report. The course for the Structural Funds, with their criteria and indicators for support, must be set in such a way that economic and social cohesion is also reflected in falling unemployment figures. My own country, the Federal Republic of Germany, is setting a bad example in this respect, for unemployment in the ‘Objective 1’ regions is rising dramatically. We have a rate of over 20%, but this figure is, fortunately, not as high in the more developed regions.

Mr President, European regulation on work times of professional drivers is necessary for three reasons; firstly for the social protection of the workers, secondly to improve the safety of road traffic and thirdly for reasons of competitiveness. We take a favourable view of the points achieved in the Conciliation Committee, and are as one with you on the points you have already mentioned, namely the inclusion of the self-employed, a clear definition of self-employment, clearly-defined work times – in respect of which, of course, more redress can again be demanded of enterprises – and the need to define exceptional circumstances as regards weekly work times and work at night. My colleagues have already stated that, without controls and sanctions, no directive will achieve any kind of progress. I believe that this is where we have to make a start. The Commission has presented a new regulation on the harmonisation of certain social security regulations relating to road transport, which will, in consequence, soon be on Parliament's agenda. There are, at present, marked discrepancies between the results achieved in the Conciliation Committee and the new proposal, which must be cleared up, and this is something on which coordination is needed. This, of course, means that we also have an opportunity to play our part in laying down sanctions and controls in much stronger form, for it is a regulation we are dealing with, and that means it is legally binding and effective in quite another way. What is most crucial in my view is that, whilst taking into account the harmonisation of competition, we should put in first place the need to harmonise social security regulations and improve the safety of road transport. If we succeed in doing that, we will already have achieved a great deal.

My group agrees with this report for the following reasons: 1. In recent years, drivers have faced ever-increasing demands as part of their job. This makes it, in our view, a matter of urgency that all the Member States should put in place obligatory basic vocational training culminating in the award of a certificate of professional competence. 2. We expect that improved quality of training will result in a significant improvement in safety in road traffic. 3. This Directive, in conjunction with the Directives or guidelines on tachographs, the regulations on work time and the social security conditions applicable to drivers, represents another building block for the social protection of professional drivers. 4. The transport sector plays a major role in the context of EU enlargement. The more harmonised provisions have already been transposed into the acceding countries' legal systems, the fewer problems of adaptation there will be with regard to technical standardisation, social security standards, provisions on the protection of the environment and road safety regulations in the future. 5. We share the view that the subsidiarity principle means that, although there must be targets as regards what training must incorporate, the actual form and method of training must be left to the national authorities. There are of course regulations that we view in a critical light, such as, for example, the low number of total training hours stipulated and their division into teaching blocks. In the final analysis, the decisive factor for us is that, in future, the job will require not only a driving licence, but also specialised knowledge of the areas of service provision, health protection, safety and logistics.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament, the Council and the Commission are united in agreeing that efforts must be made to increase the safety of air travel. The discussions that have just begun show, too, that we are fundamentally in complete agreement with this. The events of 11 September have, of course, revealed additional deficiencies, which we have to consider in isolation from the structural problems already suffered by many airlines. The two must not be confused. We are of the opinion that there is room for improvement in all the areas relevant to security – the airports, the aprons, the registration and clearing of luggage, even on board the aircraft itself. My group and I also take the view that, since safety is in the public interest and must be guaranteed for every citizen who uses airlines, public funds must also bear their share of the costs that an increase in safety entails. This, of course, demands standardised European procedures, without which we will not solve the problem, and because competition would be distorted if the burden were to revert to the airports or the airlines. We are, of course, aware that we have a problem. There is, generally in Parliament, constant discussion of liberalisation, meaning that we now want to use public funds to improve safety in this liberalised sector. This, of course, means that we have to talk in general terms about what standards can and must be applied in order to use public money to intervene in liberalised markets.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the economic and employment situation in the airline industry and in the related industrial and services sectors is critical. Although this situation was not caused solely by the events of 11 September, it was made much more acute as a result. Air passengers' confidence has fallen leading to a reduction in passenger numbers, losses have been incurred because of the closure of American airspace and airports, insurance cover has been withdrawn and there has been a decline in the numbers of tourists from the USA and the Far East: these are the main causes, as is the cancellation or postponing of orders for new aircraft. The fundamental causes of this crisis are, however, of a structural nature: crippling competition between the airlines, built-in overcapacity, a general economic recession and bad decisions by management. This motion for a European Parliament resolution refers to a host of necessary measures, for example compensation for the closure of airspace and airports, financial support or guarantees from the Member States to compensate for insurance cover being withdrawn, proposals on providing financial support to the European air transport sector so as to establish a level playing field with the United States and strategies to safeguard or create jobs. The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left supports this motion, although we are aware that it is intended as a very short-term measure and can only constitute a first step, but a step which should be taken immediately. In the medium and long term, we need a harmonised European airspace, higher standards of quality and safety, highly trained staff, high social standards and no low wages. The mass redundancies which were announced in the air transport sector even before 11 September are absolutely unacceptable to us. We need a strategy to coordinate the different modes of transport; we need an all-embracing European transport strategy. This problem cannot be solved on a mode-by-mode basis.

Mr President, my colleague Erik Meijer's report is of the greatest interest, as it touches on a core issue in services of general interest, that is, the guaranteeing of citizens' mobility within their immediate surroundings. This fundamental citizens' right was formerly predominantly guaranteed by local public services and their agents. As local public transport is mainly unprofitable, services are subsidised by the local authorities, which of course makes the local transport market interesting for private-sector service providers. The public local transport market in Germany alone is valued at some DM 30 billion. The creation of the internal market and the rise of international companies offering public transport services has led to a conflict between the previous practice of awarding transport concessions directly to local service providers on the one hand, and the international firms on the other. The Commission has therefore proposed to give competitive rules the edge over public interest and to create a new and binding obligation to put contracts out to tender. The rapporteur is, in my view quite right to question this procedure. He would give local authorities the right to decide for themselves how contracts are to be awarded. That is democracy; that is the subsidiarity principle. There must be no interference by the European Union in the conditions applied at local and regional level. I see this as a fundamental issue, as it is evidence of real subsidiarity. I appeal to my fellow Members of this House, although I know that there is little point in doing so, to support this position. We had many meetings and discussions with local, regional, national and international operating companies and interest groups, so of course highly detailed proposals were the result. Now, you do not have to agree with all these suggestions, but the basic line taken by the Meijer report corresponds to the demands of local public transport as seen by local authorities and operators, does not, contrary to what you said, Mr Schmitt, exclude the possibility of introducing competition, and safeguards local and regional transport services accessible to all and which citizens can afford.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's proposal for a directive on market access to port services was not acceptable. The removal of constrictions on free movement of services within the Community does not in fact mean only liberalisation and privatisation, but also European harmonisation with due regard being given to Member States' rights to provide public services in defence of the common interest. It is noticeable that the rapporteur took account of data specific to ports and attempted to include in his report not only requirements for safety, environmental protection and social standards but also the economic needs of ports. The vote in Committee is evidence of the fact that opinion was not divided on group lines but that there were differences of outlook specific to different countries. Removal of pilot services, cargo handling and passenger services from the scope of the directive is something I can go along with, as is the retention of licences granted to previous service providers and the setting of minimum standards for new ones. The Commission's draft has also undergone radical amendment with regard to financial settlement for investments made and the transparency of the financial relationship between ports and State authorities. Briefly, Mr Jarzembowski's report changes the Commission's document in the right direction. As, though, I thoroughly share the view of many of my fellow Members, namely that port services should generally be left to the Member States, I intend to abstain in the vote.

 Budget debates are great moments for Parliament because they afford us an opportunity to make a comprehensive review of past and future policy. Unfortunately time does not allow me to do so. I would therefore like to confine myself to just one point, that is the situation in the border regions of the Member States adjoining the candidate countries. It is beyond question that today’s border regions will benefit from European Union enlargement in the long term since there will be totally new opportunities for economic, cultural, social and administrative regional cooperation. Nevertheless, in the short term there will be tremendous pressure as they adjust to specific problems arising out of the very different levels of development, especially in the social field. I need only point out that the earnings gap between East and West is around 60%. This raises questions that did not arise with earlier enlargements and which take on a new dimension. The anticipated problems on the local labour and service markets will not be overcome without a great deal of effort. Large numbers of daily commuters will put enormous pressure on an already tight labour market – in Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania alone unemployment rates in excess of 20% are quite common. Cheap services with wage costs around 60% lower will be a tremendous challenge for SMEs and craft trades. Local and regional governments and administrations believe that the Commission’s proposed programme of assistance to border regions fails to match the scale of the challenge. I therefore welcome the inclusion of a special budget line for border regions. But I also call for additional Union funding to be made available as quickly as possible to reassure the border region citizens affected that their concerns and needs are not going unnoticed. We need a basis in law, and the Commission must create it very quickly.

 Mr President, stability and growth are objectives of economic activity that everyone wants, whichever party or group in the European Parliament they belong to. However, when it comes to defining these concepts and in particular when it comes to how we should achieve these objectives, then there are considerable differences between us. A purely fiscal interpretation will not help us to solve the present problems, which are reflected in falling economic growth and consistently high unemployment. The market economy as an economic concept is fine, but it is unacceptable as a social policy tool. Or to put it another way, the market can and should regulate the economy, but not society. We see the priority as being not a supply-oriented economic policy, but a demand-oriented one. We do not believe that liberalisation is a panacea. We need not only commercial competition, but also a linkage with economic and social criteria, in order to achieve the highest possible level of social security, sustainability and justice. Balancing budgets is fine, but not at any price. In contrast to the President-in-Office, I wish to call for an anticyclical economic policy. In times of recession, increasing public expenditure on investment in new capacity and in education and training are essential. We have the euro area, but we do not have a European economic, fiscal and social policy. That cannot work. It is not just a matter of achieving price stability alone, which is the ECB's remit, we also need to achieve socio-economic stability. A more flexible approach to the existing convergence criteria will not solve the problem, it will just shift the burden to those who meet the criteria. We need a new version that takes into account additional parameters such as the employment rate, the value-added ratio and the investment ratio, because these indicators reflect economic strength and development.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Langenhagen, the GALILEO project is technologically interesting and already has a lot of potential applications. Up until now we have had the similar Russian and American systems, but these were designed and developed and are also operated from a military perspective. The American system does in fact hold the real danger that in times when the USA is using it for military purposes the Europeans and all civilian users will be switched off, as actually happened during the Gulf war! The GALILEO project is now being presented as a civilian project that will make the European Union independent from the USA in an important field of technology. In my group, too, opinions on the GALILEO project differ widely. But we are united on one point: we want it to be used for purely civilian purposes. We have tabled amendments that are designed to ensure its exclusively civilian use. Mr Rack, I am neither naïve nor do I believe there are only good people in the world. But if we do not do this, we will have the same problem as with the American system, namely that when it is being used by the military it will be switched off for civilians. You are not solving the problem you are claiming to want to solve. Secondly, I also have concerns about finance. A total of EUR 1 730 000 000 of European taxpayers’ money is to be spent on development, validation and construction. Industry wants to join in the construction phase, contributing EUR 1.5 billion, but so far only EUR 200 million have been committed. That is 13%. From a business point of view, no company could afford to develop something with such a poor equity position. I think it an impertinence that you want to pay for this out of public funds! Thirdly, there is another aspect to this GALILEO project. The Americans allow the GPS to be used free of charge. You want future users to pay for the European system. Where do you think that will land you with your much-vaunted competition? Competition works like this: if I am being asked to pay for something that I can get free somewhere else, I am not going to pay, and you won’t get any users. Then you will have thrown all that taxpayers’ money away! Mrs Langenhagen, you described this so beautifully as a confection, and Mr Savary used the word historic! This historic confection will cost a total of EUR 3.2 billion. I think that is much too expensive for the present time and at this stage!

 Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I consider the policy of economic and social cohesion to be one of the European Union's undoubted achievements, attesting as it does the principle of solidarity between the highly-developed regions and the weak ones. Of course, on further analysis of the way structural policy has worked to date, it has to be said that it has a lot of inadequacies. Firstly: The divergence between Member States may well have decreased, but the differences within them – between highly-developed regions and weak ones – have increased. Secondly: The unemployment rate in the weak regions has not significantly decreased. Thirdly: The average per capita income of the wealthiest regions, which make up 10% of the Union's population, is still 2.6 times higher than in the regions in which 10% of the poorest inhabitants live. Fourthly: The underdeveloped regions still do not possess self-supporting economic and social cycles. They therefore have enormous problems when it comes to actually reducing the amount by which they lag behind the developed areas. Fifthly: You yourselves can see that the commitment appropriations yet to be settled totalled almost EUR 42 billion at the end of 1999, in other words the Structural Fund's input for specific projects is inefficient! This means that other measures, even other projects, must be deliberately chosen, something which can, of course, only be done in collaboration with the Member States. Whatever the shortcomings, the enormous amount of change cannot be overlooked. Differences would otherwise be markedly greater. This also means that we must carry on with the Structural Fund policy. You have just said, Mr Barnier, that there must be no taboos. Too true! All the Member States said more or less the same thing at the informal meeting in Namur, and proposals were submitted. But sooner or later, we must get to the point. At some juncture, it will have to be said that these proposals cost X amount of money, and we must either make it available or we have to admit that we are not going to. This cannot be put off for ever and a day. You will be aware that the upper limit equals 1.27% of GDP within the financial perspective for 2000 to 2006. Where are we in real terms? At 1.06%. You can hardly call that putting real structural policy into practice! It is also because of Parliament... (Interruption by Mr Jarzembowski)
 No, I am not only accusing the Commissioner; we put up with this sort of thing all the time! Not my Group, though; we have always submitted the relevant amendments. Perhaps, Mr Jarzembowski, the PPE-DE Group would like to join in next time, then we should almost make up a majority! In the context of this discussion, we must also of course bear in mind that there are very special regions. I regret to have to say, Commissioner, that the border regions programme imposed by the Commission is utterly inadequate! Perhaps we will have to give some thought to doing something similar...

Mr Schmitt’s report is supported by the majority of my group. The advantages of creating a European Aviation Safety Agency in place of 15 national agencies are undisputed: - It can create uniform authorisation procedures, - it can standardise the rules on air safety and environmental protection, and - it can create standard provisions relating to the safety of products, persons and installations. At the same time, the new Agency would be a recognised partner for aviation authorities in other parts of the world. The functions of the Agency are clearly defined: consultancy, providing technical support to the Commission, issuing the requisite official documentation, conducting checks and inspections, monitoring the implementation of statutory provisions, devising and funding research projects and cooperating with the agencies of non-EU countries. The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted other important amendments which would make the Agency more independent of the Commission as well as defining the obligation of the Agency to keep the European Parliament informed. My group also attaches importance to the provisions that are designed to increase transparency. These would subject the Agency to the following controls: - General Community budgetary procedures would apply to the Agency, - Community anti-fraud legislation would apply to the Agency, and - the Agency would be subject to regular external assessments. For these reasons the vast majority of our group voted in favour of the report.

 The conclusion that Hannes Swoboda reaches in his report on the Commission proposal regarding the system of ecopoints for heavy goods vehicles transiting through Austria, namely that we should reject the document presented by the Commission, has my own and my fellow group members’ full support. We go along with the rapporteur’s argument that the ceiling on the volume of traffic on transit routes through Austria must be maintained because the original aims of Protocol No 9 on road and rail transport and combined transport in Austria have not yet been achieved. These aims involved the reduction of nitrogen emissions and noise levels and the improvement of road safety. Instead of progress towards these goals, we have seen a steady rise in the number of journeys, which rose by 16% between 1993 and 2000 on the main haulage route through the Inn Valley and the Brenner alone and by 52% in Austria as a whole – in other words, a total of 580 188 additional journeys! The EU ceiling of 40 milligrams of nitrogen dioxide per cubic metre is constantly being exceeded by more than the tolerance margin in readings taken at the Vomp measuring station on the A12 autobahn. The same applies to the other Alpine passes that are crossed by transit routes. Despite a few reductions in pollutant emissions that have resulted from technical improvements to heavy goods vehicles, the overall level of carbon dioxide emissions has risen. If the original aim of continuous and sustainable reduction of pollutant emissions is to be achieved, the number of transit journeys by heavy goods vehicles must be reduced. For these reasons, we advocate rejection of the Commission’s proposal. To add another proposal to our debate, let me say that efforts should be made to follow the Swiss example and create rail links for the transport of heavy goods vehicles through Austria.

 European air travel is expanding rapidly, and this trend is likely to continue in the coming years. Protecting users of air transport, i.e. passengers, and guaranteeing their safety, health and consumers’ rights are becoming more and more important as air transport increases, especially as the new possibilities for travellers to book and buy airline tickets via the Internet offer advantages but also pose risks. The Commission’s proposal on which the report is based offers better protection to air transport users, especially as regards access to information about their rights as passengers. It also offers the airlines the opportunity to enter into voluntary commitments with the airports. I especially welcome the proposed strengthening of the legal framework to protect consumers, as it sets forth clear, binding and legally enforceable rules which must be complied with by all the airlines. Experience has shown that these framework rules are essential so that air passengers are fully aware of their legal rights in the event of a dispute. This does not mean that I am against voluntary commitments on principle, but I would prefer legally enforceable rules to govern the relationship between the airline and the airport as well. This is not envisaged in the report, however. The question which therefore arises is this: who is to regulate compliance with the voluntary commitments, and what methods should be used to address non-compliance? Based on these considerations, we also support Mr Collins’ demand that any issues which cannot be settled satisfactorily in the interests of consumers through voluntary commitments should be dealt with in separate proposals at a later date. On behalf of my group, I therefore support Mr Collins’ report.

My group, like many Members of this House as well as various experts, takes the view that the EU resources budgeted in the financial perspectives for 2000-2006 are insufficient, especially in view of the enlargement of the EU and the work which needs to be done to stabilise the situation in the Balkans, solve the problems of unemployment and stabilise social systems, to name but a few. There is therefore good cause to put the question of additional sources of revenue for the European Union on the agenda. Mrs Haug proposes in her report to abolish the previous system of transfers from Member States and to modify the own resources system so that the European Union can achieve financial autonomy. She calls for a European tax to be introduced as a direct revenue. My group cannot subscribe to this approach. The system of transferring a proportion of gross national product used in the past is based on a principle which is conducive to economic and social cohesion in the Union – the solidarity principle. To abolish this principle is to rob the European Union of its basis and, for us, this is unacceptable. We take a constructive view of the idea of supplementing the present system of financing the EU with further sources of revenue in the form of European taxes which do not minimise taxes in the Member States of the European Union. Our thoughts turn in this context, for example, to the introduction of a Tobin tax to cream off profits from financial transactions or the introduction of a pan-European CO2 tax on companies, which would also help us to implement a forward-looking environmental policy by applying pressure for more environmentally-friendly ways of generating energy and helping to safeguard the Kyoto agreement. We also take the view that the present financial regulation should be amended so that resources not called up by the Member States stay in the European budget, rather than being channelled back to the Member States. At the same time, we need to apply stricter budgetary discipline; for example, commitment appropriations not disbursed because they have not been called up by the recipient, should lapse after no more than 3 years, meaning that the allocation notice will need to be altered. That is why my group rejects this report.

The joint text for a European Parliament and Council directive on company law concerning takeover bids is rejected by my group. The compromise approved by the Conciliation Committee is unacceptable to us. As the proverb says, ‘Time brings everything to those who wait’, and after 12 years of discussion, we could have expected that a perfect directive would be produced. Yet the opposite is the case. What are the problems? 1. There are protected companies in the Member States, either through voting restrictions, ‘golden shares’, or multiple voting rights, etc. The directive entrenches a situation in which protected companies can take over unprotected ones, yet unprotected companies cannot take over protected ones. This means that there is no equal treatment (‘level playing field’). 2. The directive fails to include principles governing the definition of the ‘equitable price’ to be offered in the case of a mandatory bid; it also contains no provisions on ‘squeeze-out’ (the right of the majority shareholder in a company to acquire the shares of minority shareholders). 3. European companies would be exposed to pressure from the major financial corporations in Europe, with wealth creation henceforth giving way to the sole aim of maximising profits. This in turn increases the danger that this type of takeover will result in large-scale job shedding. 4. The co-determination rights of workforce representatives are not sufficiently articulated. The requirement that appropriate information should be given to the representatives of the company’s employees offers no guarantee that they will be able to exert any influence on the takeover process. The Commission itself is quite aware of these problems as well, for it proposes that a group of company law experts be requested to examine the further harmonisation of company law and define a clear position on Article 9 of this directive by March 2002. What kind of logic is that? I think it would have been more sensible to convene a group of experts to present its conclusions and then produce a directive, rather than first producing a directive and then asking a group of experts to discuss the unresolved problems. Moreover, in conjunction with the directive on company law concerning takeover bids, a directive on the requirement for neutrality is urgently required. This has been available in draft form since 1972 and has still not been adopted. It is time for Mr Bolkestein and the Council to do their homework. To give them the chance to do so, we have rejected the text before us.

The fundamental objectives of this recommendation are to increase road safety, guarantee a minimum standard of health and safety for those working in the sector and establish equal conditions of competition with other transport operators. The common position adopted by the Council fails to take proper account of these objectives, especially on the following points: - the inclusion of self-employed truck drivers - the exclusion of employees in haulage companies based outside the EU - the definition of the working times and standby duty - the definition of night work Although we realise that accepting the recommendation would lead to difficult negotiations with the Council, my group voted in favour because: 1. Self-employed truck drivers need to be included within two years of the transposition of the directive in order to resolve the problem of bogus self-employment so as to get round restrictions on working times. 2. The working times of self-employed truck drivers must include not just the time at the wheel but also the time needed to check the vehicle, do administrative work, run the business etc., because otherwise rest periods are too short, thereby jeopardising drivers' health and lowering road safety because numerous serious accidents are caused by overtiredness. 3. The definitions of standby duty, night time and night work must take account of social aspects. 4. All truck drivers must provide proof of the time spent at the wheel, irrespective of whether they are employed or self-employed.

My group is delighted that the European Commission has taken account of the demands made by the European Parliament in the wake of the debate on harmonising safety standards and reporting systems in 1997 and has presented its own proposal for a directive on occurrence reporting in civil aviation. Reports on faults, defects and malfunctions, which represent vital safety information, are now mandatory in all the Member States of the EU. At the same time, all such information is to be treated in confidence. We all want to see constant improvements to air traffic safety, passengers, airlines, technical services and responsible political forces such as the Members of the European Parliament alike. Especially since the volume of air traffic is expected to spiral in forthcoming years. It is a proven fact that most air traffic accidents are caused by human error, which is why introducing a uniform system for collecting, recording, exchanging and disseminating information on dangerous or potentially dangerous occurrences in all the Member States of the Community will allow a wide variety of occurrences to be evaluated, conclusions drawn and preventive measures taken. Systematically evaluating cases in which the wrong decision or wrong action was taken will be particularly important for staff training. Recreating and simulating situations in which a decision is required will help to ensure that staff are better prepared and react calmly to irregularities and emergencies. In addition, safety risks can be reduced by recording and storing any technical problems, faults or defects which occur in a database to which the safety authorities have access and by evaluating and disseminating the conclusions. We therefore welcome the Commission's proposal for a directive and are in favour of the report presented by Mr Collins and the few proposed amendments to it.

Mr President, Commissioner, as Mr Sterckx stresses in his excellent report, the maritime accidents involving the Erika
, the Ievoli Sun
 and the Baltic Carrier
 highlight the shortcomings of and the omissions in current Community legislation. It is high time we had strict controls and supervised ships entering EU ports or using the busy shipping lanes off Community coasts. I need only point out, in order to illustrate just how serious maritime safety is, that 90% of trade between the EU and third countries uses maritime transport. Contrary to the honourable rapporteur and his Amendment No 11 to Article 8, I take the view that the EU has sufficient weight and international clout to adopt its own regulations and standards where the IMO is unable to do so in the short term. I therefore subscribe to the Commission's proposal to install black boxes on older ships and not to allow any technical derogations for older ships. Surely it is older ships which represent a danger to maritime transport and the maritime and coastal environment? A second point I should like to raise concerns how compliance with the measures adopted can be guaranteed at national and European level. The Commission proposes setting up a new European Maritime Safety Agency, on which Mr Mastorakis has reported. Despite the general consensus on the remit and responsibilities of this new European agency, I wonder if it will resolve the fundamental problems involved in improving maritime safety in the Member States. Would it not be better to start by stipulating what the Member States themselves should do in order to anchor a uniform European approach in their national legislation and put it into practice? By that I mean, for example, specific proposals for new national databases, powers for the national authorities to conduct stricter inspections of ships which represent a risk, specific powers for coastal authorities over ships using ports of refuge or criteria for specifying the number of ports of refuge to be notified and the special safety precautions required in ports. But, first and foremost, we need to train and deploy the human resources needed. So far there has been no mention of this or uniform European approach here. This, too, is something the Commission should take into account and include in subsequent action.

 The effectiveness of the use of seat belts and restraint systems in vehicles to reduce severe injury and death is widely recognised. This applies especially to the use of child restraint systems. The Commission's proposal and the Committee's proposals for amendments improve and expand upon the existing Council Directive 91/671/EEC of 16 December 1991: 1.	Drivers and passengers in all vehicles on the road must wear seat belts where provided. 2.	All the existing exemptions for restraint systems, in particular for children, are eliminated. 3.	The child's physical size is taken into account as a parameter for the use of seat belts. 4.	Rear-facing child restraint systems which are fitted to the front passenger seat are only permitted if the airbag has been deactivated. 5.	Better information to be supplied to the public. Despite the omission of important points such as -	attachments for child restraint systems to be fitted as standard in all vehicles, -	detection systems to be introduced to indicate whether the front passenger airbag has been deactivated, -	identifying the best way of providing information on seat belts and restraint systems in vehicles, my group fully supports the report.

This package to increase safety at sea is a reaction to the accident with the Erika 
on 12 December 1999. Despite the fact that a plethora of Parliament's proposed amendments have been adopted, such as the exclusion of classification societies with some form of business, personal or family links to the shipowner or operator, greater transparency by requiring classification societies to ensure that all relevant information is made available to all interested parties on their websites, scrutiny of classification societies where the accident rate recorded by the ships classed is excessively high, the Council and Parliament still disagree on two very important points, which is why a conciliation procedure would appear to be in order if the recommendations before us, which we support, are accepted. Firstly: the European Parliament proposed that ceilings should be placed on the financial liability of classification societies in the event of an accident caused by wilful act, omission or gross negligence in their survey work. The Council was in favour of a regulation which allowed the Member States to set the maximum amounts payable, with the amounts set by Parliament here as minimum, not maximum amounts. Secondly: the Council has not accepted that there should be regular, mutual consultations between recognised organisations with a view to guaranteeing that their technical standards are equivalent to the provisions of IMO Resolution A.837 (29) and that the Commission should be provided with regular reports on fundamental progress made on these standards and their willingness to cooperate with port state control administrations. As my group is positive that a common standpoint can be found for both outstanding problems, we feel that a conciliation procedure would be in order.

 The present report on the Commission’s recommendation for the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community in 2001 states that the supreme goal of European economic policy is to make the European Union into the most competitive and dynamic economic area in the world by 2010. That is an unobjectionable aim in principle, but it is surely no mere oversight that makes the author omit the rest of this sentence as formulated at the Lisbon summit, for it went on to speak of an economic area with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. That is the very heart of the matter. A cyclical economic slowdown is rightly identified in the report, but once again the neoliberal solutions are trotted out: supply-side economic policies, liberalisation, reduction of government debt and wage restraint on the part of employees in pay negotiations. Although some important points that were not contained in the report on the European economic situation by the same author have now been incorporated, such as the need for harmonisation in certain areas of tax law, special emphasis on the importance of strengthening SMEs and consideration of environmental factors, some vital elements are still missing. Unless domestic demand is strengthened, in other words unless people’s purchasing power is increased, a sustained upturn will be impossible to achieve. That is why foremost priority must be attached to the creation of new jobs. We urgently need to redistribute work by devising every possible means of shortening employees’ working hours, to ensure that everyone who earns an income from employment is integrated on an equitable basis into national insurance and pension schemes, to show greater commitment to education and training and to alter the course of public investment policy. As long as these imperatives are not incorporated into the strategy for the development of European economic policy, we cannot give it our approval.

Mr President, Commissioner, the regulation proposed by the Commission simplifies matters remarkably, compared with the previous rules. Exceptions to aid rules are important, in fact they are absolutely indispensable because, first, additional assistance is needed in order to develop, operate, maintain and/or complete transport infrastructures and, secondly, freight sent by rail, internal waterway or combined transport should receive compensation for the unpaid costs of competing road transport, so that specific requirements, such as environmental friendliness and regional potential, can be incorporated into transport policy. An approach which only aims to prevent potential distortions of competition and fails to include environmental, social or regional aspects is unacceptable. The rapporteur, who deserves our thanks for his excellent work, and the Committee have set more far-reaching, important premises, which my group supports, such as including aid for short sea shipping, including combined transport operations at sea ports, granting aid irrespective of whether the company is a public or private company, minimising administrative costs by introducing thresholds below which no checking by or notification to the Commission is required, extending the period of aid and providing the possibility of extending the aid regulation. Once this regulation has been implemented, there will be further opportunity to shift more traffic to more environmentally-friendly carriers.

 Mr President, it is true that the European economy appears to have grown quite solidly over recent years. The main reason is the boost in exports to the US dollar area as a result of the current economic climate there and the weak euro. So the basic principle reads: a weak euro is good for an export-oriented economy and hence good for Europe. It is true that, at over 2%, the rate of inflation in Europe does not meet the stability criteria for the introduction of the euro, mainly as a result of higher oil prices, which are traded in dollars. So then the basic principle reads: a weak euro is bad for the European economy. This illustrates the absurdity of reducing economic policy measures to fiscal policy. It is true that the number of unemployed has fallen over recent years. But it is also true that unemployment in Objective 1 regions has not fallen, because they do not tend to have an export-oriented economy. So we have no convergence, just continuing divergence, i.e. a deepening social divide. It is true that investments have increased over recent years. But it is also true that most were rationalisation and non-expansion investments and that public investment in infrastructure has fallen. What has all this to do with a forward-looking economic policy? The report does not contain a single proposal on strengthening domestic demand, on the specific issue of small and medium-sized enterprises, on strengthening regional economic cycles, on European tax harmonisation, on implementing the Lisbon employment summit, mentioning instead simply liberalisation, privatisation, falling social standards and the abolition of public-funded health and pension funds. The von Wogau report must be rejected.

It is not so very unusual for a report to be changed so much through amendments that the rapporteur finds it is no longer true to his basic intentions and accordingly stands down. However, what is hard to grasp politically in this case is the way this has happened. If groups abandon jointly negotiated compromise proposals literally overnight and suddenly put in writing the opposite of their original statements, then that casts some doubt on the very seriousness of this procedure. My group is, of course, aware that a report on the transportation of radioactive materials is not a report on nuclear power as such, but the best way to maximise safety would be if there were nothing to transport. So in this context we are bound to mention keeping output and the reprocessing of nuclear fuel rods to a minimum. The fact that only 5% or around 75 000 consignments are involved in the nuclear fuel cycle says something not only about the scale of the potential risk, but also about the nature of it. We regard it as incomprehensible that a proposal for a legislative initiative on uniform standards for transporting radioactive materials within the European Union and at its borders, whilst observing the principle of subsidiarity, should be rejected. Nor can we understand why stricter checks on compliance with legislation on the transportation of dangerous goods should be unacceptable. Likewise, we believe that too little attention has been devoted to the issue of exposure thresholds. The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left rejects the report in the form we have before us.

Mr President, just a year and a half on from the start of the war, Parliament’s initial assessment has been proved right. It has proved impossible to solve any of the problems by military means, and all parties have been the losers. It is tragic that each side should resort to unacceptable methods in response to the other side’s resistance instead of finally sitting down at the negotiating table and beginning the process of reconstruction. I welcome the commitment of Parliament to respect for human rights in the refugee and prison camps. In a situation where violence is used on a routine basis, our delegations, observer missions and resolutions may be able to ease the problem, but I am convinced that they will not solve it. This is why I believe that one of our priorities will be to help this region to shape a new vision for the future. The first requirement is intensive dialogue. To this end, we should continue to use all the means available to us through our links with the Russian Duma. Sweeping condemnations, however, are unhelpful. We shall only be able to make progress in negotiations with the Russians if we take their concerns seriously too. Terrorist attacks in southern Russia and military operations by guerrillas in Chechnya, I am sorry to say, are still taking place. A short time ago, we adopted the Oostlander report, in which we explicitly welcomed the European Union’s twin-track strategy in relation to Russia. The human rights violations in Chechnya must be condemned, but at the same time we must continue to develop cooperation and dialogue. In my opinion, both components of this strategy offer scope for further development. As far as Chechnya is concerned, however, I am worried. It seems to me that the criticism of conditions in the refugee and prison camps which is voiced by the Council and the Commission, as well as by the governments of the Member States, whenever they meet with the Russians, has become something of a mechanical routine which has absolutely no effect. For that reason I should like to ask the Commission to specify the measures it proposes to take in the immediate future in order to make progress towards a political solution to the conflict in Chechnya.

 Mr President, Commissioner, what is positive about this compromise is that obstacles to cross-border freight traffic will be dismantled in the foreseeable future, which definitely improves our chances of being able to transfer freight from the roads to the railways. Our guiding principle must be to create a truly level playing field on the competition front, through harmonisation and by taking comparable cost components into account. But then there is more to competition than a debate about lowest costs and highest profits, it is also about striving for sustainability, social competence, user-friendliness, quality and service. Why should a private-sector supplier be a priori
 any better at this than one under public ownership? We have a duty to explain what we understand by general public services, and whether we think they can be provided more effectively by publicly owned operators than private operators, or less so. I believe that having equal conditions of access for all will not prove profitable in every case. Private companies must make a profit or else face their demise. Publicly owned companies can, in fact, sustain losses in areas where this is necessary for social reasons, on account of their redistribution potential. It will not do for the profits to be absorbed by the private sector and the losses to be borne by society. What we need is for the public and private suppliers of services in a European internal market to adopt an approach that is in the interests of the common good. This will require uniform framework conditions. Experience will show whether the nascent liberalisation of the European railways will mean better services for rail users. Certain Member States have already implemented more far-reaching liberalisation measures, with very mixed results. Germany – I am sorry to have to say this gentlemen from the Deutsche Bundesbahn – is a prime example of how not to go about it. Stretches of track have been shut down en masse
 at regional level, there have been railway station closures, ever-increasing cycle times, repair workshop closures, and drastic cuts in staffing levels. This has nothing to do with competing for services to the general public.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the appalling figure of 42,000 deaths a year on the roads of the European Union, the estimated 1.7 million injuries, are a constant reminder that we must give top priority to the issue of road safety. These figures do not only represent immense personal suffering, they also mean enormous economic losses and costs. These are estimated at EUR 100 billion, accounting for some 2% of the gross domestic product of all the European Member States. That is more than all the European Union Member States put together spend on culture. I want to give warm thanks to the rapporteur and I especially welcome the fact that she has concentrated on three priority areas: accident prevention, injury prevention and post-impact care and rehabilitation. In my view that makes it clear that road safety cannot be improved to the required level by individual, selective measures but only by a whole raft of measures, which include road user education, speed limits, alcohol limits, better road infrastructure, traffic control systems, improved vehicle safety standards, stricter checks on observance of road traffic rules and also constant assessment of vehicles on the roads. That is why I find it extremely regrettable that the amendment on harmonising the re-registration of cars that have been involved in accidents in the European Union was not adopted, although independent reports clearly demonstrate that there is a substantial link between vehicles that have been in an accident once and their renewed involvement in accidents with an ensuing higher death toll. I just want to address the previous speaker for a moment. You know I tabled an amendment concerned in particular with the question of motorcyclists and safety barriers, and I would be glad if you and your group could endorse it tomorrow, since I myself am a motorcyclist and am therefore obviously very familiar with this problem.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is quite amazing what excellent reports are produced, although the Commission basis is completely inadequate. The rapporteur puts forward the proposal that enterprises that have not taken up support programmes should be interviewed. I consulted numerous colleagues on this, in my capacity as owner of a medium-sized enterprise. The almost unanimous verdict was as follows: when it comes to the European Investment Fund, and especially the various components of the Amsterdam Special Action Programme (ASAP) on SMEs and job creation, we small enterprises lose track of things because there is a plethora of individual sub-programmes, responsibility for which is in all kinds of different hands, I might add. For example, there is the normal SME guarantee facility, the growth and employment initiative, the growth and environmental initiative, the EIF technology facility ETF, the ETF start-up-programme, new sub-programmes for innovation attached to EIF-ETF since Lisbon, e-Europe, e-Learning etc. How are these distinguished from one another and where must I, as entrepreneur, submit the applications for my project ideas? Parliament has the same problem from the opposite perspective, if it wants to assess how the ASAP is developing overall, because the reports from the EIB and EIF do not contain a coherent account. Sometimes there is talk, in general terms, of the full range of SME support, and sometimes the individual components of the ASAP are cited in different contexts. There are also a few things wrong with the organisation of the ASAP on the policy side. The growth and environmental initiative has not received any more funds. What is more, it strives for a completely antiquated after-care style of environmental protection. The remaining areas, i.e. growth and employment, ETF, etc. have received continuous boosts, I grant you, but they concentrate on a few high-tech sectors alone, predominantly innovation, communications and genetic engineering. In many cases, these SMEs are not dealt with directly; instead the application procedure is handled by middlemen, usually traditional risk capital and investment funds, which receive the credits and guarantees from the EIB, and which the SMEs have to go to with any complaints. That being the case, in fact nobody but the EIB knows which SMEs are receiving support for precisely which projects, and how many jobs are being created in the process. That is why hitherto, when assessing the effect these programmes have on employment, rather than providing concrete figures, the EIB has performed a simple macroeconomic model estimate. More detailed information will be available on the outcome of the whole exercise in 5 to 10 years’ time. Rumour has it that essentially, the ASAP serves to strengthen the European risk capital market for information and communication, genetic engineering and starting up new businesses, and that the job creation aspect is not actually examined in greater detail or assessed. The EIB homepage showing the list of funds to which the EIB has given credits and guarantees, fuels this notion.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since 1988 the European Union has been supporting studies and pilot schemes designed to foster regional development at Community level. These studies and pilot schemes subsequently developed into a laboratory of innovative measures. Two of the products of this development are the Community initiatives Interreg and URBAN, both of which have exemplified how experience can be amassed through the testing of new strategies and methods and then used to improve existing regional policies. Effective social partnerships and closer local and regional cooperation are among the main fruits of this innovative activity. The basis of my report is a proposed communication from the Commission to the Member States setting out the implementing provisions for the financing by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) of innovative measures for the period 2000-2006, for which guidelines were agreed in Berlin. I should like to focus particularly on two aspects of the Commission proposal. The first is the substantive realignment of the initiatives. In accordance with the proposal made at the Lisbon Summit that support be given to promote the transition to a knowledge-based economy and society within the Community, the ERDF-sponsored innovative measures are to be restructured, the eight subject areas being concentrated into three priority areas of technological development. This approach should have our support, because the gap between developed and backward regions is far greater in terms of technological development than in terms of Gross Domestic Product. To illustrate this, let me say that spending in recent years on research and development in the 25 least-developed regions of the EU has amounted to only a quarter of the European average. This is reflected in the percentage of the working population who are employed in the various fields of new technology, namely 14.6% in the 25 most highly developed regions as opposed to 4% in the 25 poorest regions. The complexity and diversity of technological change and the structural adjustment processes demand the involvement of all relevant players at the local and regional levels in development partnerships, rooted in strategic policy blueprints that must be drawn up for the development of each region. I attach particular importance to the inclusion of young people as one of the target groups of the innovative measures defined in the guidelines, since they are the future engines of development. For that reason, we should endorse the call for the responsible authorities at national, regional and local levels to ensure, by their own efforts and with the aid of all available EU support mechanisms, that the same terms and conditions are created throughout the EU for the acquisition of modern information technology by educational establishments. To my mind, a major and unacceptable defect in the support policy of the European Union is the disparate administration of programmes. While the Commission proposes a switch from project-based to programme-based funding, on which opinions may well be divided – I, for one, believe that it represents a loss of European added value, visibility and closeness to the people and, moreover, not all Member States have established the requisite regional authorities – the financing of innovative measures from the European Social Fund remains project-based. Accordingly, when one and the same programme is financed from both funds, it will be subject to two diametrically different implementation mechanisms. This situation impairs efficiency, creates incompatibility and undermines efforts to cut red tape. And so to my second point, namely the funding of innovative measures. Although only one per cent of the total ERDF budget was available for innovative measures in the period from 1994 to 1999, the Commission has now reduced the funding for the years 2000 to 2006 in what can reasonably be called a drastic and intolerable manner. First of all, the funds estimated at EUR 800 million which were originally earmarked for Agenda 2000 in the Berlin guidelines were cut to 400 million at the last minute because of an appropriation to the URBAN programme, admittedly at the insistence and in the interests of this Parliament, which had fought to save the URBAN initiative. The House had also fought, however, for the reduction of the funds available for innovative measures to be offset by means of resources from the flexibility instrument, a demand which is recorded in a declaration on the financial perspective in the Interinstitutional Agreement. And there is more to come. Although the letter sent to Parliament by the Commission on 5 September 2000 proposing the guidelines for innovative measures under the ERDF still referred to EUR 400 million, back in May 2000, in its review of the use of the Structural Funds during the period from 1994 to 1999, the Commission had proposed the withdrawal of EUR 160 million from this allocation to cover outstanding liabilities for the period from 1994 to 1999. This need had arisen because of the Commission's failure to make timely provision at the end of 1999 to cover this particular commitment. As the Court of Auditors noted in its annual report, other options were available which would have avoided the need to resort to the allocation for the current period from 2000 to 2006 in order to meet this legal obligation. This is an absolutely improper piece of cross-subsidisation between the Berlin and Edinburgh packages. In its proposal 40/2000 for a transfer of appropriations, the Commission reshuffled its resources in an extremely opaque manner in order to authorise the payment of these missing appropriations at the expense of the present programme of innovative measures and technical assistance. Not even a letter from the Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr Hatzidakis, was able to prevent the Committee on Budgets from giving its consent. All we can hope for now is that the Commission will honour its pledge to use the flexibility instrument to replace these diverted funds over the coming years and make them available once again for innovative measures under the ERDF. But I do not believe this will actually happen. Indeed, the Commission, having initially cut the budget on its own initiative, will find it almost impossible to secure the replenishment of these funds at a later date. Lastly, I should like to say that I am able to support all the amendments, since none of them are inconsistent with the general thrust of my report.

Madam President, Mr Ferber, you were absolutely correct when you defined the key criteria as affordable prices, high quality and universal availability. We agree with you there. But you did forget one other criterion. Our responsibility for our national economies also obliges us to maintain a high level of employment. Because we share these values, this Commission and this committee took the decision they did, and for that I actually ought to be grateful to the privatiser and liberaliser-in-chief, Mr Bolkestein. Anyone who is so ill-prepared to enter into negotiations, anyone who fails to present the requested report on the impact of the 1997 Directive, anyone who argues from an ideological platform – "We shall achieve these very aims you have identified by liberalising, liberalising and liberalising again" – need hardly wonder when he falls flat on his face! Your original report, Mr Ferber, was very closely modelled on Mr Bolkestein's, and I must express my gratitude to you for the fact that you allowed reason to prevail in the end. I do believe that the compromise which is now on the table takes account of the aforementioned criteria, and I am delighted that our rejection of the general liberalisation of express services and cross-border services has now been set down in black and white. I am pleased that special services have not been redefined. I am gratified that there is no deadline for liberalisation, because the paramount aim from a national economic point of view must be to provide the population with proper postal services. I believe that a guaranteed universal service is the only way to achieve this aim in practice. I am not a dyed-in-the-wool opponent of the market or of liberalisation, but the request that was made for a systematic, professional and painstaking analysis of all the implications of the directive has not been met, and that is why I am prepared to accept the present compromise proposal.

 In assessing the Directive on the own funds of banks, a number of conflicting interests have to be carefully weighed against each other. Those in favour of the directive can legitimately demand that their interests be protected, and mediation is required if a fair regulations are to be devised. It is, in the first place, savers who could profit from harmonised EU-wide regulation because their investments would be protected against losses in accordance with identical criteria. On the other side of the argument are the SMEs, which fear that regulation would make it difficult for them to raise credit because they would not be able to compete with the guarantees which large companies are able to provide. As a result, there might be job losses in SMEs. A second conflict of interests arises from the fact that, on the one hand, a fairly long transitional period is required in order to provide as many banks as possible, especially smaller institutions, with the opportunity to implement the necessary new regulations in their internal operations. On the other hand, a delay in implementing the regulations favours American banks, which profit from the current set of regulations and are able to undercut European banks in Europe. We must not allow our companies to be disadvantaged in this way, but without playing large European companies, powerful as they are, off against smaller ones, to the detriment of the latter. We support the demand for a solution to be found to the conflict between the United States and the EU, produced by the discriminatory Gramm-Leach-Bliley legislation. All in all, it may be said that the demand for European harmonisation is legitimate and that the latter would bring benefits to all sides in terms of security and fairness. However, no one side ought, in the process, to be afforded an advantage at the expense of the others.

 Mr President, in itself there is nothing to object to in the basic idea of creating a European Police College, whether it exists in virtual reality or is established with a permanent seat somewhere. The questions arise, however, of what this College is for and of what tasks and objectives it has. To take just one point, Mr Posselt writes of 'providing training sessions for senior national police officers on the basis of common standards'. That is when things already begin to get difficult. What are these common standards? As you know, Mr Posselt, police duties in the Federal Republic of Germany are a matter for the individual Länder, which are absolutely sovereign in this area. Now, compare the various Länder’s laws on police duties. You will see that, in Brandenburg (unlike in Berlin), de-escalation is the supreme precept when it comes to deploying police and that, under Brandenburg law, any police who are to be deployed are obliged to be identified by name so that anyone who might be attacked in a demonstration can read the name of the policeman concerned and know who it was. In other words, if you want common standards, you have to start by defining these. Otherwise, you end up with training that may be completely different in form from area to area. A College along these lines is not really needed just for the purpose of exchanging different types of experience. You speak about establishing public order. All right, that is accepted. Again, the only question is, with what resources? In the Federal Republic of Germany, even public order is defined completely differently in the various Länder’s laws relating to police duties. What do you understand to mean by public order? You write in your report about border control services. I ask you! We make a perfectly clear distinction between duties relating to the protection of Federal borders and the duties of the police. (In other States, it is different.) If you write in those terms, then before what you say can be approved, it must first be clear what common activities are planned and according to what standards one is going to proceed. As long as such matters have not been clarified, I have to say to you in all honesty that I myself cannot consent to the basic idea.

 We all know that we cannot base the future of our energy supplies on the energy sources of the past. The Commission realises that, even more so the rapporteur, by calling for greater priority than before to be attached to alternative energy sources and alternative energy production. I therefore thank Mrs Rothe for her good report. The first lesson we must learn from past experience with conventional energy sources – for instance, their impact on the climate and on nature, the incalculable safety risks and the foreseeable shortage of resources – is that we must considerably strengthen our support for the development and use of new energy sources. In the long term, that means we must move away from the policy of subsidising conventional, fossil energy sources. A first step here is consistently to break down all obstacles to the use of renewables. Moreover, in future we must do more to make existing best practice more widely known to the public. Secondly, the aim of any energy and economic policy must be to reduce and optimise energy consumption, for only the careful treatment of resources of whatever kind can help minimise the external costs. In that regard, we call for more targeted research into the external costs of the production and use of renewable energy sources. Lastly, we can only restructure energy supplies if we take account of the special conditions pertaining to alternative energy suppliers. Decentralised electricity provision is not just a structural but also a social aspect. Thirdly, therefore, we must not liberalise the energy sector without defining minimum social standards.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Rocard is calling on the Commission to define a framework for basic statutory health insurance systems in a Green Paper. The logic of this is that all health care not included in this basic insurance has to be covered by private supplementary health insurance. That means that the present statutory health insurance system, which has, up to now, been based on the principle of social solidarity, will be reduced to an "à la carte
" health system. The public would then have to invest additional and ever greater amounts in private supplementary health insurance schemes in order to pay for costly treatment that has, thus far, been covered by statutory health insurance systems. For example, someone who is chronically ill but who has only a small income will, in future, accordingly find it very difficult to afford the treatment they need. This simply amounts to dismantling public services and it implies turning our backs on the principle of equal health care for all based on need. We reject this socially unacceptable reform. Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights calls for the establishment of a universal right of access to preventative health care and for a high level of health protection to be defined and put into practice. On this basis, the Commission should take the initiative and create solid cornerstones by way of guidelines for the Member States' health systems. This would enable the EU to lead the way by creating a social Europe and a high standard of health care for all, regardless of income. Rules concerning the coordination of private supplementary health insurance systems in the EU make sense as long as they involve guarantees of freedom of movement for individuals and employees. We also support the call for a ban on genetic testing or medical examinations leading to selection on the basis of risk. Supplementary health insurance schemes must provide protection against the risk of bankruptcy, insolvency and fraud, but should not serve as an excuse for limiting the range of services provided by statutory health insurance.

 The liberalisation of telecoms is already very far advanced in the countries of the EU. Now a further part of the network infrastructure is under discussion: the connection of market entrants and customers to the data transmission network. This is the next logical step in the deregulation policy hitherto. But, precisely because we are dealing with the local loop, customers' interests need to be taken into particular account. Liberalisation of the local loop is actually, of course, about getting the high-speed Internet of the future off the ground (high transmission speeds and low local telephone charges are decisive for this). This being the case, a "basic supply" must also be guaranteed in this sector to all members of the public by extending the companies' Universal Service Obligations. For example, included in the Universal Service Obligation could be "normal Internet connection" by 2002 and a high-speed Internet connection by 2005, with minimum requirements for quality of service, consumer protection and content on offer and special tariffs for particular groups of society (the disabled, those receiving benefit or on a low income, those who live in outlying regions, and so on). Since this is not guaranteed in this report, I voted against it.

 Mr President, Commissioner, small and medium-sized businesses, both in the manufacturing and in the service sectors, can only survive on the market if they have full order books. They only have full order books if they have clients, and these can, roughly speaking, be divided into three categories: firstly, large companies; secondly, private consumers and thirdly, the public sector. It follows from this that small and medium-sized businesses only thrive if unemployment is low and if public budgets at all levels are free of debt and have sufficient resources to commit to the investment budget. Within small and medium-sized businesses I should like to pay particular attention to the very small and micro-enterprises, because, of course, here additional specific difficulties compound the situation, in particular in manufacturing. These companies very rarely have their own research and development capabilities and the danger is therefore particularly great that they will be cut off from the development of new products and the further development of existing ones, that they will use antiquated technologies and that they will not adapt to the demand for increasing quality. In addition, very often – because the managerial staff are not adequately qualified – the opportunities for support, which are readily available here, are not exploited to the full. All of this is quite apart from the main problems which to this day have not been resolved: permanent undercapitalisation; very poor access to credit because they cannot provide the guarantees required in normal banking practice; markets limited to their respective regions and cash loss. This means that a policy focused on small and medium-sized businesses is needed, on the one hand to standardise the assistance programmes and on the other, obviously, to take account also of the specific interests and problems linked to company size, company structures, production lines and so on. Mrs Montfort's report constitutes a considerable improvement on the Commission proposal. People might almost think, Mrs Montfort, that you yourself were a committed SME entrepreneur. Your report is excellent. Nevertheless, I would have liked even more attention to have been paid to at least two economic trends. The first is a greater emphasis on – I do not say a change towards but a greater emphasis on – demand-driven economic policy compared with supply-side economic policy. Secondly, there has also been a power shift within investment policy towards investment for expansion and – to a lesser extent – towards investment in rationalisation. Looked at another way, this means that the taxpayer makes tax receipts available which companies use to rationalise. Then they put the people who used to work there out onto the street and say to the taxpayer, now it is up to you again to sort out what happens to these workers who have been shown the door. Surely this cannot be what economists want. It may seem perfectly acceptable from a business management point of view because of the profits that it can be expected to generate, but not from the point of view of the overall economy. I think that we in the European Parliament have a responsibility to the overall economy which takes precedence over our responsibility to the business economy.

 Mr President, Commissioner, as Mrs Sudre rightly emphasises in her very commendable and extensive report, it is indisputable that the outermost regions have five characteristics which put them at a permanent or very long-lasting disadvantage. Firstly, their geographical proximity to non-EU States and simultaneous membership of the European Union. Secondly, their relative isolation because of their great distance from Europe. Thirdly, the very small size of the local internal market. Fourthly, geographical and climatic conditions which militate against the development of endogenous potential. Fifthly, economic dependence upon a few products in the economy. This inevitably leads to a situation in which these objective handicaps can, also in the longer term, only be offset, with a view to achieving cohesion, when the necessary financial resources are made available on the basis of Article 299, paragraph 2. Through this article, the outermost regions should be so placed as not to be subject to permanent reductions in their budgets as a result of the Budget debate. Just as you, Mrs Sudre, as the representative of the outermost regions, rightly call for solidarity, I would also request solidarity on your part where the interests of the Objective 1 regions are concerned, in the sense that no reductions in funds should be implemented for as long as the regions concerned are still handicapped in comparison with the developed regions of Europe. The proof of the pudding is whether, in contrast to the agreement on how best to proceed expressed by most of the groups today in the Budget debate, we want to meet new political necessities not with new money but at the expense of policies which have still not been implemented. This question will become that much more relevant the closer EU enlargement towards the East becomes. I am convinced that it is now already clear that, without a change to the Financial Perspective, it will not be possible to solve this problem. Allow us simply to act according to the proverb, ‘Do not put off till tomorrow what you can do today.’

Mr President, the Commission draft on the socio-political agenda contains many positive concepts such as full employment, quality of work, social quality and modernisation of social protection. But it lacks substance to some extent. Mrs Van Lancker’s outstanding report makes good the deficiencies of the Commission draft as regards content. We support a pact for employment and social cohesion, a European action plan for employment with a view to boosting the social economy and local employment initiatives, social regulations for new forms of working such as tele-working and new forms of self-employment, the minimum wage, and guaranteed income. The European Union has already stood idly by for far too long, watching poverty and social exclusion take hold in the Member States. Indeed Mrs Van Lancker’s proposals for improving the information available to, and participation of, female employees, and for social clauses in public contracts, mergers and international agreements, are long overdue. We object to the fact that the Commission and the Council are unwilling to make additional resources available for the social agenda. Social quality cannot be achieved free and gratis. It sometimes seems to me that the concept of modernisation is often tantamount to the undermining of social protection. Extending people’s working lives is not modernisation, no more so is funding pensions by freezing or lowering the statutory pensions level, and advising people to take up investment opportunities on the financial markets. We need modern, European social harmonisation, not deregulation.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report and explanatory comments. I am sure we are all agreed that Croatia must be given political assistance, but political assistance also entails financial support, because political stability is always a prerequisite to social and economic stability. This can only be achieved, of course, if there is an appropriate level of investment in this sphere. There is not a moment to lose if the fall in GDP recorded for 1999 and the increase in the budgetary deficit in Croatia are to be halted and reversed. In the final analysis, the only way to achieve this is through Croatia developing self-supporting economic cycles. The contribution under discussion, which would take the form of an EIB loan in excess of EUR 250 million for the period from 2000 to 2007, may not prove to be a milestone, but it would certainly help the process on its way. The course of action proposed by the Commission and backed by the report is the inevitable outcome. However, the problems that have come to light and which are as yet unresolved, are something else altogether. It is generally the case that new political challenges demand increased financial outlay, but not – I might add – at the expense of others. Therefore, we must think in general terms – and hopefully arrive at positive political decisions – firstly, about increasing the reserves for the guarantee fund, and secondly, about the fact that it must not be left solely to the Council to determine how the residual margin is to be used, and thirdly, about establishing binding criteria for the effective deployment of the EIB loan, so as to be able, at the end of the day, to monitor whether this package is actually consistent with the necessary objectives for which it was intended.

I have voted for the whole package on the enlargement of the EU eastwards for the following reasons: 1. because I regard this process as a political necessity, and 2. because I wanted to send the applicant countries a positive signal, since they have made considerable progress on the charted course towards accession. Despite the problems which undoubtedly exist and which actually affect the present EU Member States more than the applicant countries, I believe that these are outweighed by the opportunities which this enlargement process offers. As a member of the EU-Slovenian Joint Parliamentary Committee, may I say that I believe the progress made by Slovenia in incorporating the acquis communautaire 
is exemplary, a view that is corroborated by the report. I beg to differ slightly from the rapporteur in my assessment of the outstanding restitution claims and of the state of the legal system, because I know from my experience as an East German that, ten years after the unification of the two German States, the same difficulties still exist in the federal state of Brandenburg too. Objectively, this complex process can take up to 20 years to complete. I cannot subscribe in any way to the amendments to this report that have been tabled here in Parliament, because • it has already been noted on several occasions that Slovenia is satisfying the Copenhagen criteria, • the question of decommissioning the nuclear power plant is not part of the acquis
, and • while the legacy of the Second World War can certainly be regarded in diverse ways, we can hardly expect the results of that war to be brought into line with political positions that were articulated 50 years later in the Copenhagen criteria.

 Mr President, I welcome this report on risk capital, because I agree that it represents an opportunity to obtain essential funding for research, development, production and market penetration for new products, which in turn can, of course, create more jobs. We agree on many points, such as the provision of public and private risk capital, ways of making it more accessible, prioritising the availability of risk capital for SMEs, favourable tax treatment for ploughing back profits into risk capital funds, and simplifying and minimising the cost of patent applications. However, the overall concept also gives rise to some criticisms. Firstly, if this is primarily about SMEs in underdeveloped regions, why is there such a sharp focus on innovative services? I would also like to see investment in new products in innovative manufacturing sectors as a means of promoting regional development. Secondly, it is no use having genuinely good intentions as regards investing in new business start-ups and in research and development, and pumping risk capital into these areas, if the process of opening up new markets, which is highly costly for SMEs, is not included. I say this because that is where SMEs face the greatest difficulties once they have a product – penetrating the market. Thirdly, why should public risk capital only be applied in areas which the private sector is reluctant to finance? It follows that this simply means keeping higher loss risks in the private sector and reserving high-profit areas for the private sector. This amounts to a distortion of competition which puts public risk capital at a disadvantage. Fourthly, how can you guarantee that the greater involvement by pension funds in risk capital called for in the report may not lead to pension contributions being lost, which would run counter to the contributors' objective of ensuring a secure retirement? Fifthly, it remains unclear why mergers on the capital market should have a positive impact on the availability of risk capital. Experience suggests the opposite. The fewer suppliers there are, the less competition there is and the higher costs are.

 Mr President, in response to an inquiry from the PDS Group in the Bundestag, the German Government revealed that in 1999, a total of 2031 right-wing extremist and anti-Semitic criminal offences were committed in Germany. The well-known German newspaper ‘Der Tagesspiegel’ records that there have been 93 murders with a right-wing extremist background over the past ten years. Being of DDR origin, the developments in eastern Germany are of course particularly hard for me to bear. There are undoubtedly underlying reasons, stemming from the way society was in the DDR; in particular the after-effects of authoritarian structures and the weakness of civil society in eastern Germany. But there are just as many reasons that have to do with the developments that have taken place over the last ten years, for example the dissociation of economic and social development in eastern Germany from that in the former Bundesländer, the lack of respect for East Germans’ curriculum vitaes and their experience, and the lack of rigour in the debate on right-wing extremism past and present. Long-established right-wing extremist parties and organisations are transferring their infrastructure, organisational set-ups and funds from the old Bundesländer to the new Bundesländer on a massive scale. The social polarisation of society, state withdrawal from social and educational establishments and the increasingly fierce competition within the labour market, provide a fertile breeding ground for racism and xenophobia. The feeling of helplessness that grips so many people in the face of socially and culturally destructive global competition, and the suppression of politics and democracy in favour of profit-making business interests. A policy of rhetoric, underpinned by nationalism, which uses immigration as a point of departure for election campaigns, will smooth the way for racism and xenophobia. The European Union’s restrictive immigration and asylum policy, the lack of transparency, and citizens’ involvement, are contributory factors. The first thing we need though, is for there to be rigorous stigmatisation of racist and right-wing extremist views, secondly, the EU and its Member States must make their immigration and asylum policies more acceptance and integration-orientated, thirdly, we need an active employment and social policy, particularly for young people, and fourthly, we need a classical education policy that instils tolerance and considers cultural and ethnic diversity to be enriching.

My group has just voted in favour of the Lucas report, because of the following considerations. A massive warming of the earth's atmosphere in coming years because of emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful gases was recently forecast, once again by the World Wide Fund For Nature. This calls for an immediate response in the form of a rational policy and an economic system that is not solely geared towards short-term profit. With an estimated share of 15%, air transport is, of course, not the only cause of air pollution and by no means the most important. However, bearing in mind the forecast doubling of air traffic by 2015 within the EU alone, it is positively essential for the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament to take joint measures to limit the environmentally harmful impact of air traffic. These measures need to cover the whole range of harmful impacts, including emissions, noise, and poor air traffic management and town and country planning, and to take account of the economic interests of airlines in a balanced way. We support setting rigid limit values for emissions and noise pollution and the EU initiative being called for at the forthcoming 33rd ICAO Assembly. And should the outcome of the ICAO Assembly be unsatisfactory, we are therefore also calling for the EU to set its own limits. Measures of this kind can and must encourage the air transport industry to develop new technological solutions, and more efficient, cleaner and quieter jet turbines.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the fact that the Commission and the US Department of Justice have blocked the proposed MCI Worldcom – Sprint merger, and were also delighted to hear that the US Government is not inclined to approve the AOL – Time Warner deal. The Internet must continue to be a means of communication for all. We must therefore prevent the telecommunications and media giants from being able to occupy a dominant position. Competition law is an effective tool to this end. However, mergers also have an impact on employment and social cohesion. Telecommunications and media are not crisis-ridden industries; they are an expanding sector. Objectively, this makes it easier to take account of sociopolitical and employment policy aspects in merger decisions. Since the mid-nineties, the Federal Communication Commission in the USA has, in the case of several merger decisions, secured commitments from the companies concerned to increase the number of employees, improve quality of service, and do more to look after the public interest. Therefore we fail to comprehend why, in the welfare state of Europe, competition law should rule the day. We are calling for the EU to introduce binding social clauses into the mergers approvals process. Apart from the competition law test, we need additional criteria for the purposes of merger decisions, for example: firstly, the companies should give a binding commitment to preserving or raising the level of employment. Secondly, they should improve the quality of service for large sections of their customer base. Thirdly, they must implement to the letter, the mechanics of the European social dialogue and the provisions of the directive on informing and consulting workers, as they make the transition to the new merged company. Fourthly, the merger must bring added benefits when it comes to furthering the public interest. This relates to such matters as the need to safeguard a comprehensive and modern universal service, and requirements in terms of data and consumer protection. That is the only way to guarantee that competition policy will also strengthen the European social model in the new economy.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like the rapporteur and the previous speaker I think we urgently need to take the appropriate measures to tackle and eventually put a stop to the constant increase in delays in European air traffic. The discussion in committee and again here in plenary today keeps centring on the best ways and means of changing air traffic management. Sir Robert Atkins, for whose expertise I have enormous regard, and a majority in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism believe the prime way to achieve this objective is through liberalisation measures. Liberalisation will without doubt increase the number of providers, but it will not resolve certain problems and will even create new ones. Firstly, so long as the Member States give precedence to their justified national interests over the general European interest in regard to the coordination and use of European airspace, we will see no radical changes. Secondly, that is another reason for Eurocontrol’s poor efficiency. No matter whether the regulatory and control bodies are separated or not, whether you liberalise or privatise, so long as there is no political will to accept that European airspace issues can only be approached on a pan-European basis, another ten reports will not help either! Thirdly, priority must be given to the civil use of airspace. In a peaceful and united Europe there is not one logical reason for reserving a large part of airspace for the military. Fourthly, do you not agree that if we make a kind of fetish out of liberalisation, it is highly likely that there will be fewer and fewer service providers for less lucrative routes and that there cannot be fair competition unless we lay down binding, uniform, social and security standards? Fifthly, we do not need the Commission to use its influence on national governments in the event of domestic industrial disputes, as called for in paragraph 14 of the report; we need a smoothly running social dialogue between all the players involved in air traffic!

 Mr President, Mrs Peijs, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s communication on the development of short sea shipping in Europe and the very good report on it by Mrs Peijs give a realistic picture of the development of this environmentally-friendly mode of transport in Europe over the past two years. The development and promotion of short sea shipping are a particularly important step on the way to developing a system of multimodal transport for the European Union and bordering regions. Efficiency, cost-effectiveness, environmental compatibility and sustainability distinguish this form of transport from road transport and can offer a serious alternative in coastal regions. However, it is also most important to improve the cooordination between the various modes of transport so as to bring out the specific strengths of each of them most effectively. That is why the public and private sector must adopt a range of European, national and regional aid measures to adapt and develop the ports, which are the nerve centre of the transport chain, and target these measures at the specific requirements. Furthermore; it is important to adapt the related technical and organisational aspects, such as administrative formalities and documents, customs and embarkation procedures, to ensure the rapid and smooth change from one mode of transport to another and from one country to another. Other support measures should include special incentives for the development of innovative technologies, special pre-embarkation terminals for short sea shipping and integrating the ports in the development strategy for the coastal regions. This is an important means of strengthening economic and social cohesion and the links between the centres and the peripheral areas in the European Union. The integration of short sea shipping in the logistics chain of door-to-door delivery can be an effective means of sustaining the growing economic cooperation between the EU and its neighbouring states and satisfying the growing need for transport that accompanies it.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is once again time for us to consider a Commission report on the implementation of Structural Funds appropriations, this time for 1998, and to express the views of our group. The rapporteur, whom I would like to thank very warmly, depicts very varied trends in expenditure under the Structural Funds. The picture is one of some positive aspects compared with previous years, combined with continuing problems. I would like to concentrate on two issues. The first is that EU financial resources have undeniably led to a process of recovery in the poorest regions and Member States. Nevertheless, the gap between the least and most developed regions of the Community has scarcely decreased. That means that disparities in regional development continue to exist, even if the overall level is higher. This is of course totally unsatisfactory as far as I and my group are concerned. And this dissatisfaction is all the greater when you consider that the continuing regional differences, as measured in income per capita, are particularly reflected in unemployment figures. Even though there has been a reduction in unemployment in the EU in absolute terms in recent months, the total number of people without jobs is still far too high. In Germany alone there are still over 3.8 million unemployed, and the employment rate is still markedly higher.  If we were to use this issue alone to gauge the success of Structural Fund policy, we would pass a devastatingly negative judgment on it. Secondly, the problems of unemployment, which are not tackled under the Structural Funds alone, underscore the importance of efficient coordination of the implementation of funds from the various EU and national support programmes and of restructuring and allocating more money to all those funds that generate new jobs. 

As the rapporteur rightly emphasises, there was some progress in this area in 1998, but it was still far from adequate. In view of all the difficulties which undeniably exist, I regard this as a key starting point for greater effectiveness and thus more efficient use of the appropriations implemented, and I believe that this is something that people hit by unemployment in the various countries would welcome.

 Mr President, we are appalled at the present situation in Sierra Leone. There is a dangerous trend towards the escalation of armed conflict, especially as the United Kingdom has now become militarily involved outside international law and the United Nations. We demand an end to this military escalation and the immediate resumption of negotiations. One-sided recriminations are neither appropriate nor helpful in this situation. The RUF is known for its extreme brutality, but we should not overlook the fact that the government and the militias associated with it are little better. We demand that the sources of the conflict should finally be tackled, by which we mean stopping the arms trade, halting the RUF’s diamond trade via Liberia and Burkina Faso, and ending the interference of states that want to secure national objectives in Sierra Leone under the guise of humanitarian action. I have the feeling that, economically speaking, the United Kingdom is acting in a neo-colonial way and that in political and military terms it is now acting like a colonial power. It is very easy to get drawn into a war, but it becomes almost impossible to avoid the next logical step, military intervention, once the atmosphere escalates. The military imposition of peace by international troops working with government militias against the RUF will not bring peace at all. Quite the contrary, it brings with it the risk of uncontrollable escalation. It is high time that the causes of this situation were addressed and a political solution was found. Because of this, we need de-escalation in Freetown, not escalation.

Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members present in the House, Mr Savary’s report is an excellent piece of work and he deserves both thanks and recognition. I should like to focus in my speech on three aspects and I am sorry that Mrs Jeggle and Mr van Dam take the opposite view on two of these aspects. First, liberalisation of the railway networks in the Member States and the establishment of a common market for railway services is addressed from the point of view of free access and transit rights for the infrastructures of the Member States in cross-border traffic, especially freight traffic. And new technical specifications for interoperability are at the forefront here. In my view, the proposed extension to the concept of interoperability, by including questions such as the professional qualifications of staff and the need for health and safety regulations at the workplace, is of paramount importance and a vote in favour of the report by my group depends on it. Most national railway systems in the Member States have comprehensive rules governing the aforementioned social aspects and rather than lose them in the process of liberalisation at European level, we must harmonise them at the highest possible level. At this point I should like to support the call for more authority to be given to the merely advisory voice of the social partners in the sectoral committee and for the European social partners to be granted equal decision-making powers similar to those in many national regulations, when resolutions are passed. Secondly, in addition to agreeing to the minimum level of technical harmonisation proposed in the report, the preparation of ex ante cost-benefit analyses and the order of priorities for drawing up TSIs, my group sets particular store by including the social partners, associations and organisations, passengers and users in the work of drafting and checking technical specifications for interoperability. Thirdly, we also support the proposal to allow representatives from the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe to attend committee meetings from the outset. The plan to involve them in the process of discussing and setting TSIs from the outset is important if the technical standards and specifications of future candidate countries to are to be brought into line early on with current developments in the EU. This will allow us to ensure ahead of time that the infrastructure in these countries can keep pace, thereby helping to minimise the separate costs which the European Union would otherwise incur.

 Mr President, Parliament has been dealing with the situation in and around Chechnya for some time. We have followed with concern developments in the fundamentalist Islamic forces’ attempts to split Chechnya away from the Russian Federation. We are categorically opposed to any form of terrorism and we support the fight against terrorism in every country in the world. I believe that the territorial integrity and sovereignty of every country is an inviolable and fundamental principle. However, for several months a war has been raging in Chechnya which none of these arguments can justify. I spent over six years of my life in Russia and have very close ties with that country. So I feel it all the more that Russia is totally overreacting in its use of military force in the Chechen conflict. I find it totally unacceptable that we are witnessing violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian army. It is a matter of deep regret and profound concern to me that militaristic thinking has now again taken hold in Russia. It has long been recognised that military might never permanently resolves any conflict, and this needs to be remembered now. It is high time that this war ended and that a political solution to this conflict was found, no matter how difficult and complicated that might be. Furthermore, an enormous effort is required to restore this devastated region for the people who have lost all their possessions in the war and to make it habitable once again. In the long term, this is the only way to remove this focus of conflict. My Group supports this motion for a resolution, and we consider it essential that this Parliament, in conjunction with the members of the Russian Duma, should seek means of restoring peace in Chechnya without delay.

 Mr President, this morning we had a debate on whether or not, in future, the House should meet in plenary on Fridays. A possible justification cited in favour of change was that the agenda is generally relatively uninteresting and that something should be done about this.

Mr President, our primary duty in the struggle to protect the civilian population, refugees and prisoners of war in Chechnya is to do everything to finally bring the war in Chechnya to an end. This should also be uppermost in the mind of the parliamentary delegation due to travel to the war zone over the coming weeks. Only a political solution to all the issues connected with the conflict and reconstruction of the region will guarantee a change in the awful situation faced by the people in the towns and villages which have been destroyed, in the refugee camps and in the prisoner of war camps. I should also like to warn against judging just one side and apportioning blame solely to the Russian side. It is clear, including from the report by the Council of Europe delegation, that human rights have been violated and war crimes committed by all the warring factions. They must be investigated and the guilty must be called consistently to account. But we should also give the competent Russian authorities the chance to do this themselves.

Mr President, in this draft legislative resolution, Parliament approves the ECB’s recommendation for a Council regulation concerning the continued calling in of foreign reserve assets. The following reasons are given: first, the Treaty makes provision for this. If it is not applied in the form of a regulation, this could be construed as a difference of opinion between the ECB and the Council. Secondly, the ECB should gain in financial independence. Thirdly, the foreign exchange intervention instrument will be made more credible and the capacity of the ECB to adjust to various scenarios will be fostered. Of course, there can be no objection to any structural improvement of the ECB’s financial situation. The only question is whether or not pouring more money into it will solve the problem once and for all. Before an answer can be given, the following questions at least must be considered: Firstly: does it make political and economic sense to apply the sort of restrictive monetary policy which the ECB applies and which is more restrictive than the FED? Secondly, does the increase in interest rates for top refinancing facilities and deposit facilities applied on 9.2.2000 not run counter to economic growth? Thirdly, are more decisive measures to reduce unemployment permanently not the most tried and tested means of guaranteeing price stability? Fourthly: in addition to a supply-orientated economic policy, should greater emphasis not be placed on a demand-orientated economic policy, i.e. strengthening the European internal market through reduced import tax rates in the Member States? Fifthly, is it so wrong to assume that the exchange rate set when the euro was introduced had more to do with political wishful thinking than economic reality? Sixthly: what specific grounds are there for assuming that the ECB will probably sustain a loss in 1999? Having answered these questions, our Group felt unable to vote for the proposal for a resolution. Not because the ECB has too few foreign reserve assets, but because it is wrongly organised structurally and will therefore complain endlessly of these liquidity problems.

 Mr President, Mr Guterres, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, it is pleasing to hear the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency declaring full employment to be an aim of European policy. I agree that this should be so, but to be successful in the future a model of full employment requires, above all, professional and socially secure jobs. We need to structure the economy and the world of work in such a way that gainful employment becomes worthwhile. You are relying mainly on further deregulation in the internal market, on the Internet revolution and on e-commerce and e-business to be job machines. This policy will not allow you to keep your promise of full employment. Economic reforms such as the liberalisation of the internal energy market have led to stiff competition and numerous mergers. This has cost jobs and the trend is continuing. As early as the mid-nineties, Mr Bangemann promised a huge increase in jobs due to the information society. The result is sobering. The growth in media, mobile radio communication and software was not able to compensate for the job losses in the telecommunications sector and in the electronics industry, and for the rationalisation resulting from the introduction of information technology in other sectors of the economy. When I see that many companies engaged in e-commerce admittedly have huge market capitalisation, but that their actual business is constantly making losses, this does not necessarily make me feel any more optimistic. E-commerce and e-business certainly have a great future. But their contribution to employment growth is overstated almost religiously by their proponents. That is why I believe that we need a different policy mix for a new policy of full employment. That means, firstly, greater easing of monetary policy, a budgetary policy designed to strengthen investment in expansion and in the future, and a wages policy geared to productivity, so as to stimulate internal European demand and generate more jobs. Secondly, it means a strategy to make drastic cuts in working time and redistribute work between men and women. Thirdly, it means more state support for employment in ecologically sound sectors of the economy and a suitably future-oriented innovation policy linked in particular to boosting small and medium-sized enterprises. Fourthly, this is about an emancipatory labour market policy. This entails rejecting low-wage-sector strategies and work requirement models for unskilled jobs, because only a broad-based training initiative will allow us to produce a sufficient pool of qualified workers for the knowledge society, and to deliver environmentally efficient, social and cultural services. If we do not go down this path then we will undermine our future prosperity, our competitiveness, our economic productivity and the social cohesion of society.

 Mr President, I share the view that we need to make more progress from the point of view of efficiency and the analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the services offered. But as an entrepreneur myself, I really cannot understand why it is always assumed this can only be done under the headings of "privatisation" and "liberalisation"! Or perhaps people are not concerned with creating the same conditions of access to the postal services for all, but are thinking only of the capital employment conditions for companies in large conglomerations. Members should however represent all the citizens, which means it is their duty to think not in terms of business management but in terms of the national economy. In practice that means the following for the postal services: firstly, priority must be given to employment. I have nothing against liberalisation and privatisation, but the premises must be right. Secondly, we must guarantee that the citizens are not faced with reduced postal services. Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this certainly is a risk. Mr Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country in which prices rose far higher after liberalisation than in all the other Member States of the European Union. So that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent. Thirdly, it is vital to have, first of all, a universal postal service at an affordable price for all citizens, wherever they may be; secondly, to have a uniform price for all Member States; and thirdly, to have daily mail deliveries and collections on working days. On the question of the cost-effectiveness of the various postage weights, it is worth considering further price cuts; but that is what the postal administration itself is saying. We do not have to adhere to a weight of over 300g when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of 150g to make it at all worthwhile. In that respect I believe it was right and important to hold this debate today, to make Mr Bolkestein aware of Parliament’s position and allow him to take certain aspects into account from the outset.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Viceconte’s report is a very good piece of work in my view and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly on it.   He has succeeded in setting forth in a very lucid manner a field which is broad and difficult to pin down exactly; that of the economic, social, cultural, sporting and health-related activities in the sphere of tourism in all its many forms, taking into account the diverse requirements of the EU Member States. The difficulties attending dealings with the European dimension of tourism, and the support that the Council, the Commission and Parliament are required to provide, were clearly articulated.  What I consider to be particularly worthy of mention is the approach whereby we are to take our cue from the scale of the economic sector of tourism and its importance in employment terms in the EU, and deduce from this the need to create and apply a Community framework for activities.  Irrespective of the stalemate situation vis-à-vis the Council, the Commission should exploit the opportunities which also exist at present to develop elements of a European tourism policy. And these include the following: firstly, establishing strategic priorities for developing this sector; secondly, drawing up a list of criteria, which will make it possible for specific, tourism-related interests to be taken account of in the implementation phase of EU projects within the scope of the various programmes; and thirdly, seeking and establishing a suitable method for arriving at an interim solution for financing expenditure on coordination with Community measures in other policy areas – employment, the environment, structural funds, Community initiatives – until such time as a legal basis is adopted.   It is also absolutely vital for the Austrian Council Presidency’s compromise proposal concerning the adoption of a multi-annual framework programme to be put into practice as soon as possible. Of course this will mean that those Members of the Council who blocked its adoption will have to be urged in the strongest terms to think over their rejection of it and change their minds.   At the same time, the European Commission, as well as the Member States, could, and should, integrate the development of policy guidelines for the tourism sector into the drafting of a framework programme, or the two should be pursued in tandem. The Commission must make it its business to analyse the various national regulations and activities and extrapolate generalisations for the EU area on this basis. These can, and will, form a sound basis for the drafting of the EU framework conditions.   In view of its enormous employment potential, it is precisely the economically under-developed, or problem, regions of the EU that tourism will have an impact on in terms of stimulating local economic activity – agriculture, handicrafts, services, transport, trade, as well as education. In other words, it will be possible to set up regional economic cycles. It is extremely important, in this respect, to make the sustainability of measures and the protection of natural habitats in our environment our guiding principles. Small and medium-sized companies offering tourist services are perfectly suited to this, for they ensure that vacation and leisure facilities, health cure establishments and sporting activities are adapted in a harmonious manner to the natural environment.  Other aspects, such as the observation of non-discriminatory practices at the work place, which constitute a general principle to be applied in the implementation of Community policies, must be firmly established in the measures for supporting tourism in the various EU programmes. At the same time, special attention must be given to the specific issue of the high proportion of women employed, foreign and part-time workers, and appropriate assistance activities must be supported.   Experiences gained in the German Bundesland Brandenburg – where I come from, and which is one of the Objective 1 Regions of course – demonstrate that not only did targeted assistance for small tourist enterprises preserve or create jobs, it also enabled substantial progress to be made in the development of rural areas by promoting green tourism, for example taking conservation areas into account. And EU funds have also made a considerable contribution to this in the past.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted this opinion on the EQUAL report at its concluding discussion with no votes against and one abstention. I am deliberately stating this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there is in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. This cross-group support for the opinion is explained by the conclusions, which are devoted to the question of how issues related to regional policy, transport and tourism can be combined with action to combat all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market. The members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of course also identify a number of areas of the Commission proposal which they would criticise: firstly, for example, the insufficient thematic guidelines laid down for the development partnership activities; secondly, the fact that strict selection criteria for evaluating the project proposals will only be drawn up only at a later stage by the Commission and thirdly, the fear of excessive administrative and technical expenditure on project management by the Commission and the technical assistance bodies. That is why a ceiling needs to be set for administrative expenditure. The committee based its conclusions on these critical comments. We attached particular importance to linking the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and excluded people in the social sector, in tourism and in small and medium-sized enterprises with promoting the establishment of new small and medium-sized businesses bearing in mind the necessary economic structural change. Dovetailing the activities under the Community initiative with the European employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for attaining the objectives of the EQUAL programme. We fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at European level as an integral part of the EQUAL programme. The specific target of deriving European added value brings the regional cooperation up to European level while retaining the cooperation of the various regional operators. This is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it.

Mr President, the war in Chechnya has now been raging for four months. The European Parliament has condemned it and has demanded a ceasefire and political dialogue. Parliament has helped to ensure that humanitarian aid is given and that European Union funds are diverted in this direction. There is no end to the war and to the suffering of the civil population, let alone a permanent solution to the conflict. Has the EU really done everything in its powers? The fact is that the Council and some Member States, including Germany, are extraordinarily reticent in their political, diplomatic and economic reactions to Russian’s persistent refusal to enter into political dialogue. The European Union and its Member States must make it clear that the completely disproportionate use of military power to solve the conflict in Chechnya and the massive infringements of human rights are unacceptable. The European Parliament should fight for the partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia to be suspended until Russia agrees to a ceasefire. In addition, we should call on the Member States to impose additional political, diplomatic and economic sanctions. Arms deals and financial support for the warring factions must be stopped immediately. Russia’s sovereign right to protect its territorial integrity and pursue terrorists is undisputed. The question is, which instruments is it entitled to use in order to do so? The dividing line between dialogue and cooperation with Russia and sanctions because of the war is a very fine line. We should not discourage and isolate Russia as we did umpteen times in the last decade. Mutually advantageous cooperation and partnership with Russia are indispensable to the peaceful development of Europe. However, the European Union’s foreign policy will only be credible if it does not shrink from consistent political, diplomatic and economic action in the event of war and massive infringements of human rights.
