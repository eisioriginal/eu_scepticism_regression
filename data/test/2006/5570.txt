Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with a certain amount of emotion that I face making my last speech in this parliamentary term, and I would like to start by dealing with the things that have been said in this Chamber by calling on Commissioner Barrot to intervene and resolve this matter that all too often involves Member States that like to pretend that the fate of asylum seekers is someone else’s responsibility. Just a few minutes ago, we saw the buck being passed between Italy and Malta, just as a few days ago we heard about the boat Pinar
, which was at sea too long, leading to the deaths of those who probably could still have survived. This is therefore what I believe we are talking about when we talk about asylum; we are talking about this real need, this commitment that Member States must show to reception policies. I warmly welcome the proposals put forward by my fellow Members, by Mr Masip Hidalgo, by Mrs Hennis­Plasschaert, about the amendment to the Reception Directive and the Dublin Regulation. Both proposals are moving in the direction of improving the European Union reception system for asylum seekers. I believe that we have a duty to stress the equivalence between European citizens and asylum seekers, because asylum is not something granted by Member States to people who are fleeing from wars, asylum is a duty of Member States and it is the right of those people to be able to stay in our countries with all the rights that European citizens enjoy. I therefore believe that this is a benchmark for the civilisation of our political initiative and our law-making capacity. I therefore agree with the amendments to this directive and this regulation, I believe that we must guarantee the right of asylum to all those who ask for it because the future of the European Union depends on the quality of our reception. I believe that this should be a point that defines the very idea that we hold of the European Union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what happened the other day is just the latest in a long line of shameful tragedies that have assumed mammoth dimensions. The death at sea of emigrants trying to reach our shores is without a shadow of a doubt the greatest violation of life wrought in civilised Europe. These tragedies demonstrate the terrible face of our fortress. Perhaps we ought to begin to think about our responsibility for the deaths of men and women whose sole ambition was to find a better life and escape hunger and war. Therefore, we should probably analyse the fact that those shipwrecked in the Mediterranean are not an anomaly of a mechanism that creates illegal immigration; rather they are a foreseeable consequence of the immigration policy of the European Union and its Member States. The slaughter in the Mediterranean is caused by the philosophy of repression, by the policies of turning people back at sea, by the virtual barbed wire along our coasts, by the prohibitionist practices implemented in the immigration policy of the European Union and its Member States, including Italy and Malta. There is no other way to enter Europe; there are no legal channels for accessing the European labour market or finding recognition of the sacrosanct right of asylum. Hope is consigned to the stormy waves of the Mediterranean Sea; rights are delivered into the hands of unscrupulous boatmen, who have become the only means, or at least the most accessible means, to enter the European Union. That is the real cause of the deaths off the coast of Libya a few days ago. That is the reason why, in the last 20 years, tens of thousands of migrants have died in an attempt to reach Europe; faceless, nameless men and women reduced to food for the fishes. I asked President Pöttering to open today’s session with a minute’s silence, as a sign of mourning in recognition of these victims. I thank him for granting my request. I think we had a duty to do this, but clearly it is not enough. It demonstrates our indignation, but we must try to produce a policy in this House, a concrete policy, that begins to say never again, never again must there be deaths in the Mediterranean.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the last year the number of refugees worldwide has increased. The figure now stands at approximately 12 million. If we include those who are internally displaced, this rises to more than 26 million people worldwide who are in need of the same kind of protection. The reason for this is that wars continue to exist in the world; at present there are 4 million Iraqi refugees and displaced people, and it is clear that these refugees are a consequence of wars that our countries played a part in starting. The creation of a common European asylum policy is necessary because, under the rule of law, we have an obligation to guarantee that these people are received equally throughout the European Union. This becomes all the more important if we consider that some Member States do not yet have a systematic law on asylum. I note with regret that harmonisation of asylum procedures has been deferred for two years, meaning that it will be implemented in 2012. We must put an end to the awful disparity that exists between the Member States and the different asylum systems. We are at present in a paradoxical situation whereby recognition rates of candidates to refugee status for certain third country nationals vary from approximately 0% up to 90% depending on which Member State receives the request. Harmonisation of standards should result in a high level of protection throughout the EU and should not be based on the lowest common denominator. The institution of asylum is an essential part of our democracy and the protection of human rights, and it is unacceptable that it has been severely eroded in recent years, as the needs of asylum seekers and the principle of non-refoulement laid down in international conventions have not always been respected. The European Union should provide for mechanisms at the external borders to identify asylum seekers and ensure that persons entitled to international protection gain access to its territory, including in the context of its external border control operations. For this reason we consider it appropriate to review the role of Frontex, which often handles asylum seekers as if they were illegal immigrants. With this report, the European Parliament is asking Frontex to provide detailed data relating to the number of asylum seekers identified as such during its operations and the plight of persons intercepted and sent back to a country of transit or origin. We must ensure that international conventions are correctly applied, as well as cooperation agreements with third countries. Agreements cannot be made with countries that have not signed the Geneva Convention. Many Member States ignore this, however, including Italy, which has signed an agreement on managing migration flows with Libya, a country that does not intend to sign the Geneva Convention on refugees. We are very pleased – we have emphasised this and hope that it comes across in this report – that the Court of Justice has annulled the article of the Asylum Procedure Directive concerning the creation of the concept of ‘safe third countries’ and a common list of safe third countries. In our view, there can be no such thing as a ‘safe third country’; it is an erroneous concept, since any citizen can be persecuted even in countries with high democratic standards. Asylum seekers are vulnerable people who require appropriate reception conditions. Member States cannot detain people for the sole reason that they are applying for international protection. I would therefore argue, as a matter of principle, that asylum seekers should not be detained. Unfortunately in many Member States the detention of asylum seekers is still a reality, due to the fact that they enter the country illegally. Regrettably, and I will conclude with this point, there is no other way to enter the European Union. This is the paradox: even asylum seekers must be subject to mixed flows to enter the EU. Asylum is not a concession: asylum is a duty for states and a right for those fleeing war.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my fellow Members who have spoken in support of this report, as well as Mr Barrot for his support and the work the Commission is undertaking to amend certain directives, particularly the Asylum Procedure Directive, demonstrating a willingness to improve the common asylum system. Parliament acts as co-legislator in this field, and I believe that we must exercise our role in order to harmonise asylum procedures at a higher level, pushing for a system of harmonisation that allows for large numbers to be received and improves standards of reception in the Member States so that the system is increasingly cohesive. I believe that this Parliament has fulfilled an important role by visiting administrative detention centres in Europe. We have visited a great many of them – Mrs Roure was the rapporteur for the final report – and we have observed that often the right to asylum has been breached in Member States, often normal reception conditions such as the right to healthcare and legal aid have not been guaranteed, and information on potential asylum seekers has not been provided. This has happened because mixed flows have been managed in such a way that the fight against illegal immigration and the defence of external borders has taken precedence over the need for reception and in particular the reception of asylum seekers. I agree with the points made by some of my fellow Members, particularly on the need to review the Dublin regulation and to guarantee a solidarity mechanism between Member States in order that the burden might be shared, but also that we need a solidarity mechanism regarding asylum seekers because their right to be transferred to another place so that their case can be heard must also be recognised. Finally, and to close, some Members have raised the question of border controls. I think that there is a basic error in this reasoning: the issue of defending borders and the issue of asylum are two wholly separate matters. We must guarantee the right to asylum as a fundamental right to be upheld within the European Union.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there are between four and a half and eight million non-EU citizens in an irregular situation in Europe – these are the Commission’s figures. This is an utterly negligible number: just over 1% of the resident population of the European Union. It is clearly a problem that has been over-exaggerated. These are workers who perform useful services, such as personal services and work in the tourist industry and, in the vast majority of cases, they have been absorbed by the job market. These are workers who are useful to our economy, but they are exploited workers – exploited to reduce labour costs and to enrich unscrupulous employers. These are workers who often do jobs not performed by EU citizens. We need these people, but they have entered Europe illegally for a simple reason, which is that there is no legal way for them to come in. The same thing happened to the great majority of citizens whose situation is now legal but who entered the European Union illegally. What was needed was another measure: one that regularised the situation of these millions of people. What was needed was a measure to free them from slavery, blackmail and exploitation. Instead we have a directive that carries on where the Return Directive left off. First we decided on the expulsion procedures; today we are deciding on the potential expulsion catchment area and are even specifying who will pay for the expulsions. With this directive, the exploited pay more than the exploiters. Unfortunately, there is no provision for a general regularisation measure, not even for those who report their own status, or who report their exploiters or the crime that is being committed. They go straight from being exploited in illegal work to being expelled. We needed something different. We needed a measure to favour legality, and not the criminalisation of those who are currently here illegally. We needed a measure to curb xenophobia. Yesterday, the Italian Minister for Home Affairs said specifically, ‘We have to be hard on illegal immigrants’; in other words, we have to be hard on the vulnerable. I believe we are fostering this kind of xenophobic attitude with this directive. We in the European Union need immigrants – the Commission says so itself: 50 million by 2060 – because we are in the middle of a demographic crisis, but we are doing nothing to help them enter. Instead, we are harmonising the expulsion system and today we are deciding to expel those who are here illegally even though they may be workers who have been absorbed into the European job market. I think the effects of this directive will be devastating, because it will make immigrants and the job market go even further underground and increase the exploitative crimes of unscrupulous bosses.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday Mr Maroni announced that one had to be unkind to illegal immigrants, but for days and months, Mr Maroni has been practising unkindness towards migrants whose position is irregular. I say this because the Lampedusa emergency, the so-called Lampedusa emergency which has now lasted for 10 years – therefore it seems to me to be a bit of a pleonasm to go on calling it an emergency – was desired and created by the Italian Government. In fact, by choosing Mr Maroni, the government made a decision not to allow any more migrants to leave Lampedusa. The Centre for Temporary Stay has had at least 1 800 people shut up in there without the government arranging for any of them to be transferred. They are held in such inhumane and degrading conditions that the centre exploded into a true democratic emergency. Now I believe that this is the true Lampedusa emergency, that is to say, the need to establish a sort of juridical free zone, a place where migrants would enter and be deported without each case being examined individually. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees states that at least 75% of those who arrive by sea in Italy and gain the right to asylum request it. Thus, if Mr Maroni’s practices were put into effect, the migrants would probably not have the right to asylum since they would immediately be deported directly from Lampedusa in accordance with the wishes of the Italian Government. Hence, there is a genuine emergency and the cause of it is Italian government policy. The citizens of Lampedusa have become aware of this, Mrs Muscardini. Indeed, they have carried out a general strike against the government, against its immigration policy, in order that the centre for immediate expulsion from that place – the centre for identification and expulsion – should not be opened. They have also asked the Italian Government to modify its position on the Centre for Temporary Stay. It is good of Commissioner Barrot to go to Lampedusa in the next few days and I appreciate this. I have prepared a dossier and sent it to Mr Barrot. In the next few days, my group, too, will organise a delegation that will visit Lampedusa.

Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 60 years ago, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights launched a real global revolution, affirming the prophetic idea of Immanuel Kant, the philosopher, that the infringement of a right in a single country ought to be felt as such in any other part of the world. The human rights revolution placed before the international community two closely inter-connected concepts. The first is that one cannot and should not distinguish between citizens and foreigners, men and woman, whites and blacks, Christians and Jews, Muslims and non-Muslims, believers and non-believers. In short, it confirms equality for all in claiming their own rights. The second concept is that humanity is itself the guarantee of dignity, and therefore nobody may be treated in an undignified manner, not even the worst of criminals. As Kant himself says, we cannot refuse the wicked man the respect that is his due as a man. The European Union is considered to be the supreme home or temple of human rights protection. Effective protection and promotion of fundamental rights ought to be the cornerstone of democracy in Europe. The implementation of fundamental rights ought to be an objective of all European policies, and to that end, the EU institutions ought to promote them actively, protect them and take them into full consideration when drawing up and adopting legislation, drawing support from the activities of the Agency for Fundamental Rights. This agency can make the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights effective and, at the same time, can ensure compliance with the system established by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Unfortunately, within the European Union we have not always been able, through the political choices made by governments and the legislative activities of parliaments, to ensure the protection and promotion of fundamental rights. For six years, the European Parliament has not adopted a report on the status of fundamental rights within the European Union, while we have always been quick to point out infringements of fundamental rights outside our territory. We cannot only draw attention, rightly, to Guantánamo, Abu Ghraib, the infringements in Colombia and in China, and then ignore the infringements that are occurring in our own countries. I agree with what Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner said today: we need to build consistency between the European Union’s internal and external policies. A close analysis of the state of fundamental rights in the European Union is liable to confirm the unwelcome conclusion that in Europe, human rights are often protected only in name. To corroborate this statement, one only has to look at the conditions of displaced persons, national minorities, the Roma, stateless persons, refugees, asylum-seekers and economic migrants. Tomorrow is International Migrants Day and the United Nations Convention has still not been ratified by even one of the Member States. In recent years, we have analysed the state of degradation of administrative centres for migrants which, in terms of both the law and living conditions, are outright black holes in which men and women are often treated in an inhumane and degrading way, without the requisite legal safeguards intended by laws which are often unacceptable and which, at the same time, guarantee abuses and impunity. The situation of human rights within the European Union is by no means satisfactory, and the annual report by Amnesty International says as much. We must therefore try to operate an active policy to prevent systematic violation of the rights that ought officially to be guaranteed and defined as inviolable. For that reason, we call upon the Council – and here I take full advantage of the presence of the Secretary of State – to include in future annual reports on human rights in the world, as well as an analysis of the situation worldwide, also an analysis of every Member State, so that we can – and I am just finishing, Madam President – avoid a double-standards approach. What kind of Europe do we want? That is the question which this report, for which I have the honour of being rapporteur, seeks to answer.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Commissioner Barrot and Mrs Yade for their words in support of my report. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, Mrs Gál, Mrs Roure, Mr Guardans and Mrs Ždanoka, for the active contributions they have made to the report and its composition. I believe that the questions that have been raised are very interesting, and I would particularly like to spend some time on a point raised by Commissioner Barrot. At a time when the economic crisis is intensifying, we must avoid having an outright war within the European Union between poor people, citizens discriminated against because of their social conditions and citizens discriminated against because of their living conditions, or their expectations, or even because of their arrival in the European Union and the fact that they have been welcomed in the best possible way. It is true that the crisis is liable to intensify racism and xenophobia, and I would like to tell Mr Brejc that we have very carefully analysed the report by the European Fundamental Rights Agency and, previously, the report by the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, and have found that in recent years, there has been an exponential increase in racist and xenophobic acts in the European Union. That is why we are very concerned about what is happening and we think that we need to encourage processes that will actively produce a role where the promotion and protection of fundamental rights becomes the most effective focus for creating a Europe of peace, one that is committed to promoting intercultural dialogue and is free from barbaric practices. I believe that in this way, through this report, we can help to improve the role played by the EU on the international stage. I will not spend time on other questions that emerged from the debate, some of which do not merit a response from me, but I very much welcomed the exchange that took place and the proposals that were put forward by many fellow Members who took an active part in the debate.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we should try to draw up a balance sheet of Frontex’s failures over the past three years. If we do so, we will discover that there has been a great deal of propaganda. There have been just in excess of 30 joint operations at the borders, deaths at sea have increased over the last three years and the vast majority of resources which, alas, are continuing to increase, are destined for the protection of maritime borders, in spite of the fact that Frontex itself tells us that only 15% of irregular immigrants arrive in the European Union by sea. Let us refer to them like that, as irregular immigrants. I know that I also have the support of Commissioner Barrot on this point, so let us not continue to call them illegal immigrants. One of the things Frontex has demonstrated to us is that it is possible to use firearms in an indiscriminate, arbitrary way. In a joint operation in September around Lampedusa, we saw the havoc. Now, despite the fact that some of our points have been included in the Moreno Sánchez report, I want to underline these criticisms because I am fairly confident of the fact that this Parliament can change its opinion quickly about Frontex. A little while ago, I was in splendid isolation when I stated that it was necessary to change the mandate of Frontex, by placing the priority on rescue at sea, but tomorrow this may finally become the general view of this Parliament. I continue to be a critic of Frontex because I believe that the agency's activities do not respect the rights of asylum seekers. Turning people back at the borders is a reactionary utopia, and I believe that it is very difficult to curtail the natural need for free movement of men and women. Today, Frontex is the symbol of fortress Europe and a concrete tool for militarising our borders.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the resolution was approved by this Parliament, we went to visit Roma camps and we were able to see with our own eyes how they welcome people and how they live. We visited the camps in Rome and we were able to ascertain that, in reality, Roma really need special protection, if only because since the EU’s expansion, they have become one of the larger minorities in the European Union. We need to ensure that this minority is recognised as a European minority for all intents and purposes. The efforts which have been undertaken during these last few years have been disorganised and have not been coordinated by the European Union. So much money has been squandered and has failed to make any structural and lasting improvements to the Roma's situation, especially in areas such as education, housing and employment. We witness racial discrimination on a daily basis, both at local level and in programmes which are not geared towards integration. We also constantly witness discrimination by the police or even racial stereotyping by governments, which are thinking about registering Roma using fingerprinting or other forms of registration. There is a real campaign of criminalisation being conducted in Europe against the Roma community. Every day we hear statements from political figures which are tending towards this, from both right and left. I hope that Mrs Angelilli can convince the leader of her party, who is also President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, that Roma can be integrated, contrary to what he has said in public.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group, I would also like to express my condolences to Mrs Klamt. I would like to immediately examine the substance of today’s debate, since the European Union is continuing to adopt a schizophrenic policy with regard to immigration. This is happening in the Member States’ policies: they have signed the pact on immigration and asylum, which expressly states that zero immigration is harmful and unrealistic for the European Union, but then we discover that my country's minister of home affairs is advocating the closure of the borders for the next two years. Community policy on immigration continues to be schizophrenic. Mr Gaubert is right in saying that we are facing a demographic crisis in Europe and that we need more immigration. The Commission has explained it to us: we need 50 million immigrants by 2060, but we are doing nothing to encourage them to come, and instead we have made it a priority to harmonise the return policy. Today, we are debating a single residence and work permit exclusively for those who are already in European Union territory and we are creating the Blue Card for highly qualified workers, which will have an impact of only between 1.5% and 3% on the immigration rate in Europe, and thus will play a minimal role as compared to our real requirements for workers in Europe. Currently, there are approximately 6 million unauthorised workers in the European Union who have already been absorbed into the labour market and who are kept in unauthorised positions because, clearly, such a situation is convenient in keeping down labour costs and cutting down on social welfare protection. We think that we ought to start with a regularisation programme for these workers who have already been absorbed into the labour market: we think that the Blue Card is a mistake, in making a selection upstream of immigration; we think that the definition of highly qualified workers is too restrictive and we think that Community preference is a form of outright discrimination. We believe that there ought to be a complete change in direction for immigration policy. We know how to read the fact that the Blue Card is the first signal in opening up legal immigration channels, but this is not enough to ensure that our group will vote in favour.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to thank Mr Tajani, and to make a few points. The first is that in recent years airports have become the places in which the ‘security’ obsession finds its prime application. There is a common thread running through this proposal and the PNR proposal, with the indiscriminate handling of air passenger data, and the regulation on liquids, which was put in place after an alleged attack two years ago, but it was then discovered, after the regulation had come into force, that all those who had been suspected of terrorism had been acquitted. The body scanner is the last frontier in this modern torture, as Stefano Rodotà describes it. The mania for extracting ever more information that could be useful in the fight against terrorism is fostering an authoritarian interpretation of the rule of law. There is a clear violation of privacy, human rights and personal dignity. The new requirement for total surveillance is reproducing the apparatus of social control. The control mechanism of a ‘mass-surveillance prison’ is being developed within society, so that all citizens are gradually being transformed into suspects who need to be monitored. The creation of these instruments is a confirmation of Foucault’s theories, and the body scanner seems like a page taken out of the book Discipline and Punish
. It is no accident that the main cradle of this strategy is the body: Foucault says that through the political technology of the body we can read the shared history of power relations. So, for these reasons and in this context the authoritarian character of the body scanner is apparent, and for these political and philosophical reasons it is not, in my view, acceptable to subject our bodies to this tool, which is yet another despotic display of technological power.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what Commissioner Barrot has said does not convince me that there is any real benefit to be gained from using this PNR data. There is still no clear evidence that this data can make a genuine contribution to the fight against terrorism and organised crime. The fact is, in this frenzy to identify alleged terrorists, everyone has become a suspect. I believe that certain points need to be clarified with regard to the use of the data that will be collected and the way in which it is to be handled. By contrast, we are often witness – from the information at our disposal – to arbitrary and indiscriminate activity where data is frequently passed from hand to hand and is not always transferred correctly. In my opinion, this eagerness to extort information does not help the defence of our personal protection. The undue precedence of security over freedom has often resulted in the removal of safeguards of our rights.
 Giusto Catania  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am also disappointed that the French minister has left, because he could have learned, for instance, that the information that he supplied to us is incorrect. In fact, Mrs Dührkop is correct in saying that the vast majority of terrorist attacks carried out in the European Union have an independent basis and have nothing to do with Al-Qaida, contrary to Mr Jouyet’s statement. In that case, we could have removed that suggestive equation, often put forward to us, between Islam and terrorism. This is a frequent tendency and, unfortunately, it also has its adherents in this Parliament. I am thinking of the attitude adopted by Mr Borghezio in the recent Cologne demonstration as, if this framework decision were valid, he would certainly be accused of provocation to terrorism. I would define Mr Borghezio’s activities as provocation, and on behalf of the Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left, I would like to make a formal request for the President of Parliament to issue an official warning to Mr Borghezio. I believe that the strategy adopted over recent years in the fight against terrorism has been a losing strategy, and has been too subordinate to US interests in the war in Iraq and in Afghanistan, in the formulation of the list of terrorist organisations, and in the restrictions placed upon the rule of law. There have been too many instances of improper handling of personal data and I believe that we must all work together – and I am just finishing now – to ensure that we do not restrict individual freedoms, to increase democratic areas and to ensure that we do not, in the name of security and the fight against terrorism, help to achieve the very goals of the terrorist organisations themselves.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this directive is a disgrace and an insult to Europe’s legal culture. It is totally unacceptable and liable to cancel out the culture of welcome we have had for thousands of years, and the deep roots of a European identity that has been forged through the practice of hospitality. The directive is yet another monument to Fortress Europe, the materialisation of a reactionary utopia seeking to obstruct the freedom of movement of men and women. The right to mobility cannot be checked by shutting men and women up behind barbed wire or inside a foul detention centre. Mr Mate, we are talking about 18 months – the maximum detention period – not 6 months, as you said. That is 18 months without having committed any crime! I would like to refer to the words of Archbishop Agostino Marchetto of the Council of Migrants of the Italian Episcopal Conference, when he said that a person cannot be detained for a mere administrative infringement and also that persons cannot be kept in inhuman and degrading detention centres such as those visited by this Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. Furthermore, this directive is an inhumane directive because it makes provision for return to a country of transit. Libya is likely to become a mass deportation destination for migrants. It makes provision for the detention and expulsion of unaccompanied minors, it lays down a re-entry ban, thus systematically infringing the right to asylum, and provides for discretionary legal aid. That is the true nature of this directive. What is more, the directive is being imposed by governments. In this Chamber we have been party to the dictatorship of the Council, which has said to Parliament: ‘like it or lump it’, even issuing threats against the idea of any sort of continuation of the debate on immigration. The European Parliament is passively submitting to this decision. I appeal to the dignity of European Parliament. This is not co-decision. What we are looking at is giving assent to the Council. The truth is that governments want to activate immediately the EUR 700 million allocated by the Return Fund. That is the true nature of the directive. What we ought to do, though, is to listen to society, to those outside this Parliament, the heads of state of third countries, Amnesty International, the churches, the European Episcopal Conferences, the trade unions and the Council of Europe: all of them are telling us not to adopt this directive. Even the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which according to the Treaty of Amsterdam should be consulted on all matters relating to asylum and immigration dealt with by the European Commission, is telling us not to adopt this directive. Repressive policies like these are the real cause of the European Union’s greatest tragedy: deaths at sea. Yesterday 150 died, and over the last ten years there have been 12 000 such deaths. The European Union is staining itself with an unacceptable crime and this directive makes it further complicit in these killings that have turned the Mediterranean into a graveyard. It would probably be a good idea, as a tribute to these martyrs, not to adopt this directive.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a political and media campaign is under way for the criminalisation of migrants and the Roma in Italy. A number of Italian MPs have exposed the Italian Government’s true self here today, for example Mr Fiore, Mr Borghezio and Mr La Russa, who, as we all heard, clearly said that Schengen needed to be suspended, illegal immigration made a criminal offence, and all Roma expelled: it is tantamount to equating the Roma to criminals. This is the real Italian Government. The campaign is evident from the fact that it has just announced the appointment of a Roma special commissioner. This was followed by a round-up of Roma, instead of arresting those who set fire to the Romany camps in Italy. Statements of the kind that we have heard here are often expressed by various ministers in the Italian Government. This is why, Mrs Muscardini, we are having the debate now and did not do so sooner. Only one thing needs to be said, and I will conclude on this point: there are 200 000 Roma in Italy. Of these, 80 000 are Italian citizens. Of the remaining 120 000, 50 000 were born in Italy. If we granted citizenship, that would probably solve a large part of the Roma problem in Italy.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is often concerned about human rights violations outside our territory and fails to realise that our policies contribute to the systematic violation of rights outside the EU. This is why we believe that the mandate of the EU Fundamental Rights Agency should also cover countries which have concluded stabilisation or association agreements, or even to countries which have concluded readmission agreements with the EU. We believe that this is important for migrants and for asylum-seekers, who are often expelled from our countries and sent to places where individual freedoms and fundamental rights are not guaranteed. We should also mention the country which currently holds the EU Presidency, Slovenia, where citizens without records and therefore without citizenship are sent to countries such as Kosovo or Serbia, with no guarantees for their safety. We are also concerned because in the fight against terrorism, international cooperation has reduced the level of protection of fundamental freedoms. It is for this reason that the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on this report demands that all measures provided by Parliament be implemented, particularly with regard to CIA flights and the illegal detention of suspected terrorists.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I much appreciated the willingness of the Commission and also of the Council to reach an interinstitutional political agreement quickly in view of the new transitions we will be experiencing in the next few months. From January 2009 this Parliament will be able to play an important role in freedom, security and justice, particularly in terms of the need for European citizens to be able to exercise democratic control over the choices being made within the area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union. We think that 2008 will be a year of transition, and therefore a number of priorities in terms of freedom, security and justice must be identified in the course of it. I think we need to go forward with matters on which we cannot turn back, matters we need to insist on. I am thinking about the need to introduce a common asylum policy for 2010 and the need to speed up the process that could lead to defining this common policy; I am also thinking of the need to come up quickly with a general plan for legal immigration, not just to encourage the admission of qualified or highly qualified immigrants, but to prepare a plan that covers all admissions to the European Union; I believe that we also need to focus on the freedom of circulation of men and women within the Schengen area, profiting from the results achieved in 2007, and to try to capitalise on these aspects. I believe we also ought to try during 2008 to assess some of the choices that have already been made. In particular I am thinking about two important questions. I think that a genuine assessment must be made of the usefulness and effectiveness of Frontex. It seems to me that an objective assessment could quietly bring us to admit that it has not produced the effects that the vast majority of this Parliament and Europe's citizens had hoped for. In the same way, I think that an assessment must be made of the enormous quantity of databases at our disposal. All too often, the exchanges of information are not of any value and sometimes the information is lost. To conclude, Mr President, I think that we should probably also make a final assessment of the Returns Directive. It appears that we have now reached the point of no return, and we probably need to change our strategy: to come up with an action plan and a plan for legal immigration, and then we will know how to kick out, expel and detain immigrants.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I also think that we need to have a transnational police force that can specifically tackle international crime, which today is no longer confined within national borders. Only a few days ago the Italian Parliament’s anti-Mafia commission went to Germany, where it found that an enormous amount of the financial resources invested in Germany have been obtained through a mechanism that directly involves Sicilian and Calabrian criminals. I believe that this is emblematic of the real need to combat crime on an international basis, and one way to do so is by putting in place European police resources. I believe that Europol can accomplish this job, but I have some doubts about whether transforming Europol into an agency can immediately salvage it. We have a duty to evaluate Europol’s activities from 1994 to today, and I believe that we will probably also need to review its specific mission, because I think that its priorities ought to be tackling drug trafficking, money-laundering and transnational Mafia organisations. I believe that there are also still some problems regarding the need to fully recognise Parliament’s powers. Parliament should have supervisory powers – this is the case for all national parliaments, which have supervisory powers over the national police – and I believe that the European Parliament should have supervisory powers over a European agency whose key tasks are policing and combating international crime. I also believe that we need to have some clarifications on data protection. I am extremely worried because the proposal, as it has been adopted and probably will be adopted in the future by the Council, has serious deficiencies which put the individual data of European citizens at serious risk.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank Mrs Angelilli for her sensitive approach to a very important matter: a society that knows how to welcome its children will know how to welcome all its citizens. In the same way, I believe that today in this Parliament we are taking a very important step, because institutions that are able to address the concerns of minors will certainly be more able to address the concerns of all European citizens. This report contains many interesting and dynamic ideas, which are also pointers for the Commission in relation to further steps that we expect. There are some points that need to be emphasised, especially the need to pay great attention to unaccompanied minors held in administrative detention centres for migrants. When it inspected those centres, the European Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties found that in many countries, such as France, Belgium and Italy, many unaccompanied minors, many children, are held in inhuman and degrading conditions that are unacceptable for young children as, incidentally, they are unacceptable for all men and women. We emphasise the need to insist on that point. We also believe that great attention must be paid to avoiding child labour. Child labour is often linked to exploitation and poverty. That is why that this Parliament must make a major contribution towards improving social conditions in the European Union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Vice-President Frattini and all the fellow Members who have worked with me, and the proposers, to draw up this resolution. Manifestations of racism and xenophobia have increased in recent years, as is borne out by the reports of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. This increase is closely linked to the growth and proliferation of political forces which, in Europe, have interpreted the problems raised by immigration in an aberrant way, often to put forward slogans defending race and identity, and to stir up feelings of self-preservation against those entering Europe, describing them as terrorist threats or criminals, or even branding them with unacceptable anthropological names and xenophobic and racist slogans. Parties and movements which in recent years have had strong anti-European nationalist leanings, and are highly racist, are on the increase. Their political propaganda draws on social insecurity and tries to add pieces to the mosaic of the war of civilisations. That propaganda is now a mainstream part of the political and institutional debate and in some cases, seems to be the message emerging from governments or as the result of the activities of governments. Tomorrow, we shall vote on a resolution on extremism, a title which is perhaps a little vague. Lenin said that extremism is the infantile disease of communism; we could paraphrase Lenin and say that extremism is perhaps an infantile disease of all political, religious, economic and ideological programmes. Mr Weber is right: there is left-wing extremism and right-wing extremism, but there is not just left-wing and right-wing extremism, there is neo-liberal extremism, Catholic extremism, Muslim extremism, ecological extremism and anarchic-insurrectionist extremism. The problem in Europe, however, is the growth of right-wing extremism and the problems which are causing right-wing extremism to proliferate. Neo-nazi and neo-fascist political forces and movements have been set up in recent years in Europe and have made it their policy to work against European integration – we have seen them in Italy, in France, in Austria, in the Netherlands, in Belgium, in the United Kingdom, in Germany, in Denmark, and in Switzerland; they reflect the crisis that has led an intellectual such as Alfio Mastropaolo to describe the offensive of the new right as the mad cow of democracy. The democratic legitimisation of certain political forces has helped dangerous ideas to spread into the body of European society, feeding reactionary leanings. A dangerous, and in some cases underestimated, disease which feeds on ethnocentric proclivities, often concealed and hidden, in some cases masked by seemingly democratic and legitimate acts. We therefore need to question our choices and our political initiatives. There is a growing emphasis on the need to establish and consolidate a shared European culture and identity. I believe that a European identity and culture must be built on the basis of dialogue and contact with cultures other than those that have in recent years promoted and paved the way for the dissemination and the growth of a European idea, a European culture. A major cultural battle is needed, and that is my conclusion. Police or public security activities are not enough; there needs to be a major cultural effort and only in that way will we manage to ensure that 2008 is actually the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, because Europe must be founded on intercultural principles.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that today, with this motion for a resolution, we are taking an important step, because this Parliament must always condemn acts and events that endanger the lives of men and women on the grounds of their faith, religious beliefs or political opinion. Religious freedom is a value that we must bring to the fore. Although it is true that in some cases Christians risk persecution and criminalisation, it is for this reason that Parliament must protect and defend them, just as this Parliament has always protected and defended Muslim citizens who have been the victims of discrimination in the West. We believe that all religions can play a positive role, a peacekeeping role, to encourage respect for diversity. For this reason we must strongly condemn any form of religious fundamentalism, which is so often a factor in conflict. I believe that this Parliament must always endeavour to listen and promote interreligious dialogue. There are some notable examples that show how it is possible to construct a solution in which religions can listen to each other and build on common ground. I am also anxious to recall the sacrifice of some Catholics, some Christians, who have fought to free the poor, for peoples and for social liberation. This is why our group is voting in favour of this resolution, in memory of priests such as Peppino Diana and Pino Puglisi, who died because of their stance against the mafia and organised crime in general.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too, on behalf of my Group, believe that today is a very important day because we are extending the possibility of free movement for many Community citizens. This marks a ground-breaking step forward, about which we are very happy because it guarantees additional freedom of movement. It is a great achievement, pointing us in the direction of a single European space. My Group is nevertheless somewhat hesitant about certain other aspects, especially concerning the external dimension of the Schengen area. We are in fact strengthening the external dimension of the Schengen area, reinforcing and in a sense actually militarising our external borders. We have grave doubts about this: while guaranteeing ever greater freedom of movement for Community citizens belonging to the Schengen area, we are at the same time impeding access for non-Community citizens. For this reason we are not happy with the entire process. Furthermore, we have our doubts about the implementation of SIS II: we are very concerned, and believe that in certain cases these exchanges of information do not afford proper protection for sensitive data. We therefore think that a very tangible step forward has been taken today in the building of the European Union, yet at the same time we have sent out a very negative signal about the form and substance of this European Union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Frattini has spoken to us today first about legal migration and then about irregular immigration. If European Union policies followed the logic of his words I could agree with him, but unfortunately that is not the case. In recent years EU policies have first and foremost used language such as refusal of entry, migrant criminality, repression, the spectre of invasion; now, at last, we are beginning to speak of entry policies. Therefore, we can all agree that a policy on legal migration is crucial in order to combat irregular immigration, to prevent human trafficking, to avoid sea crossings by the hopeful, and to stop the Mediterranean increasingly becoming an open-air graveyard. We should also be logical, however. Consequently, before proposing policies on refusal of entry we should discuss how to broaden legal entry channels and how to tackle the demographic challenge. I did not really understand what Mr Frattini was referring to today, whether he was talking about press leaks. In actual fact, the forecast of 20 million immigrants by 2030 has been made by the European Commission itself in its Green Paper, which explained that the demographic crisis in the European Union is such that we will need 20 million immigrants by 2030. However, 20 million immigrants does not mean 20 million skilled immigrants. We are proceeding from back to front: first implementing policies on refusal of entry, then deciding how to bring in skilled immigrants and, finally, tackling the major problem of what to do about all the others. I believe that we should take a closer look at the policies implemented in recent years and analyse them. We also need to assess what kind of policy we want on refusal of entry. To consider 18 months of administrative detention is in itself, I believe, an offence and a systematic violation of human rights. We should also examine what Frontex is doing. This year we have spent €45 million; Frontex has 90 staff and carried out four missions at sea this summer. I do not think we can be satisfied with the policy pursued by Frontex. Its policy has given refusal of entry precedence over saving life. I would conclude on this point: saving life must be a priority. At the request of our Group’s Chairman and others, the Commission was to report to us today on the affair of the seven Tunisian fishermen who are in prison in Italy for having rescued 44 migrants. I hope Commissioner Frattini will be able to enlighten us on this affair, which is in keeping with the logic of criminalising immigration.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think this House did a remarkable job of work in approving Mr Fava’s report. Similarly, I think the General Assembly of the Council of Europe made a significant contribution to ascertaining a truth that has now been proven: there have been thousands of flights, there have been dozens of kidnappings, and there has been direct involvement of European governments and EU intelligence services. We have witness statements and we also have the minutes of the special European Parliament committee, testifying to the fact that European governments sat down with the US administration and discussed extraordinary rendition. This is a proven fact and public knowledge, which I believe deserves to be respected even by those colleagues who voted against this report. There is only one black hole in this affair: the silence of the Council. It is rather embarrassing here, given that everyone else has spoken out. However, there is one anomaly: while the Council remains silent the governments are acting. It is not true that the governments are turning a blind eye; they are doing whatever they can to prevent clarification of the truth. For instance, the Italian Government is currently avoiding seeking the extradition of the CIA agents involved in the judicial measures and has even invoked official secrecy to slow down the judicial activity on the case of Abu Omar. Thus the governments are indeed acting while the Council maintains its silence. In my opinion this is wrong! The excellent work done by this House deserves respect, and surely a sign of respect should come first and foremost from the Council.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are accustomed to declaring that combating terrorism is a priority and invoking new political legislative initiatives. I believe that we ought first to assess the choices that have been made over the last few years and ask some questions. Firstly: is terrorism stronger or weaker as a result of our legislative initiatives? Secondly: have we made a specific contribution to the development of our legal culture and our values, or have we betrayed them in the name of the terrorism crisis? I believe we should make it a priority to answer these two questions, and that if we did so we would discover that emergency measures have often been mistaken and that the lists of terrorist organisations have been imprecise, often dictated more by political motives than a real danger posed by the organisations. We have appointed a person to coordinate counter-terrorism activities, and then we have found, without any clear reason, that we can do without the functions carried out by this person. I therefore ask the Council not to appoint a new counter-terrorism coordinator because over the last few months we have discovered that we can easily do without one. We have often said, and we say it firmly, and I think that we ought to say it again in this Chamber, that terrorism is the enemy of our civilisation, it is the enemy of the rule of democracy: terrorism is barbarity. Terrorist attacks represent a move from the rule of law to a primitive state. All this is true, but instead of focusing the debate on the reinstatement of the rules of democracy we have chosen to tackle the issue by restricting the rules of civil coexistence. We have chosen to fight on our adversary’s home ground, to compete on violations of human rights, on military controls over the civilian population, on the negation of the key principles of democracy. The images of Abu Ghraib or of the Guantanamo base are the symbol of the victory by the culture of terrorism over our rule of law and the key principles of our legal culture. The other symbol is the CIA’s flights and abductions in Europe, with the explicit involvement of European governments. There is an embarrassing silence about these events – as my fellow Members have done, I also call upon the Council to express itself on this point – there is an embarrassing silence, everyone has mentioned it! This Parliament has spoken about the responsibilities of the CIA, the responsibilities of European governments, the responsibilities of our intelligence services. The Commission has spoken and the Council of Europe is speaking about this. The only embarrassing silence is from the European governments and I believe that this is unacceptable. Let us hope that today the Council will state its view on this issue. In Europe, unfortunately, the exception has become the rule and now we must have a clear debate on the effects produced by our legislative choices: biometric data in passports and visas, the system for control of personal data, databases on telephone communications, databases on air passengers, PNR agreements, the SWIFT system, the system of storing fingerprints and even the regulation on liquids, which we hope today to reject resoundingly, giving a signal to the Commission that we ought to make choices that are in proportion to what we want to combat. I believe that we should say emphatically that we have chosen an authoritarian distortion of the rule of law instead of choosing to safeguard the rule of law in order to combat terrorism. It is not clear – and I am just finishing, Mr President – whether in the past few years European citizens have been put in more danger by terrorism or by the measures taken to combat terrorism. An American feminist writer has said that when we are offered solutions by those responsible for our problems we should be on our guard. I believe that we should be on our guard.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for a few seconds the display for the sitting said ‘Iraqi refugees’. The slip-up has evidently also affected the technology in this Chamber. Indeed, that is the subject that we ought to have been debating: the 4 million Iraqis who are trying to come to Europe but to whom we are not showing any hospitality. Instead, we are debating Cuba, because an international campaign is under way that led this Parliament to vote against Venezuela in the last part-session and will probably lead it to vote against Cuba today. We now expect that someone from the Spanish People’s Party will put forward a resolution against Ecuador and Bolivia. That is what we are expecting. The real purpose, in fact, is to combat the economic policy that a large part of Latin America is implementing at the moment, in contrast to neoliberalism and the imperialistic philosophy of permanent war. That is an objective fact in our debate. Instead, I believe that we should call strongly for a review of the European Union's common position and for a review of the embargo. What the Council did last Monday in inviting a delegation from the Cuban authorities to Brussels was a very significant step that we ought to welcome, so as to initiate a positive dialogue and to give due merit to the progress made by Cuba. I believe, however, that the content of this resolution, right from its first clause, explicitly states the views of one side of this Parliament. In other words, it is calling for a change to the social, economic and political system of an island and sovereign state. I regard that as unacceptable.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Roure for her persistent work with the Council in putting together this framework decision. It has taken a long time, but we can say that we have at last reached an important milestone. It is quite right that we should combat racism and xenophobia with legal instruments, but I think that above all we must implement widespread cultural action. I believe that this Parliament also has the means to initiate an effective information campaign in Member States, to ensure that this framework decision can be organised into a great cultural battle of ideas. I believe that it is necessary to fight against racism and xenophobia, because the data provided by the European Monitoring Centre are alarming. There are increasing reports of racist and xenophobic behaviour, and it is my belief that we must tackle those who frequently attempt to incite racial and religious hatred. This can be achieved primarily through the media, which are all too often used to communicate messages that are highly dangerous for society. I believe that the initiative adopted by the Council, but above all the work carried out by Mrs Roure in this Parliament, will serve as an effective tool for the political efforts and for continuing this work. As Mr Frattini has said, we need to establish the limits within which there is a balance between freedom of expression and the fight against racism and xenophobia. I believe that this is vital and that we need to implement strong political measures and important cultural action.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, 20 June, is World Refugee Day, which makes this debate particularly fitting. There is however great hypocrisy in our debate, as just two days ago this Parliament decided to remove the issue of Iraqi refugees from the list of urgent matters. This is an extremely important issue, given that we are talking about over four million people fleeing an infamous and illegal war. We should in fact be discussing this matter and the difficulties that the European Union has in receiving these refugees, the majority of whom are received outside of the European Union, and considering how these refugees are often received in our territory. A European Parliament delegation recently visited Samo and noted that within the detention centre on that island – a horrifying place – there were Iraqi, Palestinian, Lebanese and Afghan asylum seekers, all people from war zones. I therefore believe that we must think long and hard about the need to guarantee respect for the right of asylum, in order to prevent that which has unfortunately occurred frequently in Europe in recent years, namely mass expulsions and failure to honour the right of non-refoulement
. We have witnessed too many symbolic cases; the fact is that over the last few years migratory pressure has increased and successful applications for asylum in Europe have decreased. I believe that this is indicative of a problem that we have within the European Union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Frattini was right to talk about solidarity, but for us the first solidarity that we should show is to the families of the people drowned in the Mediterranean, solidarity to explain to ourselves as well that we should stop calling them illegal immigrants but should probably refer to them as shipwrecked people. That is in fact what they are: people – men and women – who drowned in the Mediterranean while trying to reach Europe and who were not even given a chance of being saved or rescued at sea, but were actually left for three days clinging to a tuna net. It has to be said quite plainly: someone has to take serious responsibility for that! Mr Frattini said so clearly in an interview to an Italian newspaper, when he mentioned the serious responsibility of the Maltese Government. That needs to be repeated here in this Chamber, as well as the fact that they did not even have the decency to bury those people; even the idea of taking them in after death was rejected. Therefore we ought seriously to consider the fact that, although Frontex may have a specific task to perform, its priority must be to rescue people at sea. That is something we said a short while ago when we were debating the Rapid Border Intervention Teams. This, sadly, was by no means the first tragedy; over the last ten years more than 9 000 human beings have drowned while trying to reach Europe, but this was the worst tragedy in the last ten years. We should also carefully consider the need to expand the legal channels for people to enter legally and also the possibility of reviewing the Dublin II regulation in order to prevent what has been happening. Look, in my view something serious is taking place: we are losing sight of the guiding principles of Western civilisation, which is based on hospitality and the right to burial. As the great tragic playwrights of ancient Greece taught us, we ought to start afresh from that point, not least so that we can develop a new idea of reception and hospitality for Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, an international campaign is being conducted to delegitimise Venezuela, its freely elected President and all its democratic institutions. There is a direct relationship between today’s debate and this international campaign; even the European Parliament is inappropriately debating an issue that is for the Venezuelan national government alone to decide. What is more, our debate focuses on an inappropriate sector, that of human rights violations, when in fact we all know that no human rights have been violated. The reality is that this represents a political move; it is no accident that this agenda item was put forward by a group of MEPs and not by an official European Parliament delegation as some have tried to claim, to be precise, by a group of MEPs who went to Venezuela and met with members of the opposition only. In reality, the non-renewal of the licence for Radio Caracas TV is a matter for the Venezuelan Government alone, and their decision respects the country’s laws and constitution. Radio Caracas TV will be able to transmit via cable, satellite and the Internet, and therefore those who claim that the decision represents an act that is hostile to freedom of expression know this to be a lie. There are a great number of cases in Europe in which frequency licences are not renewed and yet this Parliament has never spoken of human rights violations and curbing freedom of expression. The fact is that freedom of expression and pluralism of information and television broadcasts are guaranteed in Venezuela. In the particular case of Radio Caracas TV we are talking about a television station that played an active role in supporting the coup in 2002 and the oil blockade in 2002 and 2003. Any accusations of subversive activities should therefore be made to those who have encouraged the breakdown of Venezuela’s democratic and constitutional regime through a terrorist campaign and by manipulating information, and certainly not to a democratically elected government actively demonstrating its social commitment.

Madam President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, as fate would have it, today, 23 May, we are discussing in this Chamber the fight against organised crime. It was on this very day, 15 years ago, that an extremely serious event took place in the history of Italy, and the history of Europe: Giovanni Falcone, the high-level judge, was assassinated by the mafia in a horrific manner, when they blew up the section of the motorway between the airport and the city of Palermo. His wife and three other agents in the escort died together with him. That year, 1992, was a terrible year, because after Falcone, another judge – Paolo Borsellino – was assassinated by organised crime, specifically the mafia. Both of them had realised how important it was to conduct legal and police cooperation at international level and thus they had gathered how necessary it was to combat criminal organisations at a higher level – at an international level – focusing above all on intercepting the capital of criminal and mafia organisations. Falcone and Borsellino were the umpteenth victims in a series of slaughters in the Italian Republic that began with the massacre at Portella della Ginestra on 1 May 1947. So many things have changed over the years; criminal organisations have become transnational, and this change had already occurred by the end of the 1980s, when the liberalist dogma was confirmed in the policy of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The globalisation of the economy and of finance has occurred through the deregulation of the financial and trade markets, the privatisation of services and the reinforcement of tax havens. We have seen confirmation of what an authoritative research body, the Transnational Institute of Amsterdam, has called ‘the Global Fix’, that is, a global compromise between the theoretically legal economy and the criminal economy. This is international trafficking in arms and drugs and money-laundering. In certain ways there has been confirmation of the tendency of liberalist globalisation to encourage crime. If we analyse the studies by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, we can see that, since the 1980s, the underground economy has quadrupled. In 2001 black-market transactions ranged between USD 6 500 and 9 000 billion a year, that is, between 20% and 25% of the world’s gross domestic product. We are talking about a horrifying figure that could help to overcome poverty on a worldwide scale. In this context some important phenomena have arisen. Most important of all is the fall of the Soviet Union, which resulted in the transfer of many State assets into cash and directly to cartels and criminal organisations. It is no coincidence that, today, the Russian mafia is very strong, in both economic and political terms. Much of this money transited via numerous accounts in Switzerland, the Cayman Isles, the islands to which Mr Matsakis referred, and Gibraltar. The other major trend that was confirmed in the 1990s was the push by the US and the UK to deregulate the financial and international markets. The globalisation of the financial markets itself contains the seeds of the reorganisation of criminal forces. The other great event that increased the income of organised crime was the return of war. The war and the way in which it is intertwined with liberalist globalisation has led to a frightening increase in revenue for international mafia groups, including in particular an increase in profits from drugs. In the Andes region in Colombia, the ‘War on Drugs’ philosophy has given rise to an exponential growth in the production of coca and the processing of coca plants into cocaine. The war in the Balkans has turned that region into an off-limits area where money is laundered and heroin is refined for the European market. Think about what happened in Afghanistan! In 2001, before the military occupation, opium production was 74 tonnes per year. In 2006 – and my source is the US Department of State – opium production had risen above 6 000 tonnes, and this growth is closely linked to the military occupation. Today Afghanistan produces 93% of the total world output of opium. How much is drug production worth today on the global market? The UN, which is unfortunately not very credible on this subject, says that 1% of the world’s GDP is derived from drug trafficking; the US Department of State says that it is 2.5%, and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs says that between 2% and 5% of the world’s GDP is based on international trafficking in narcotics. This is just one piece of information, because to this should be added trafficking in human beings, arms, waste, counterfeiting of products, and all these profits are immediately laundered and injected into the legal market. We need to take action on capital, assets and financial transactions, and that is why we believe that the confiscation of the assets of the mafia and of transnational organised crime is a key factor in the war that we must wage on the mafia. Pio La Torre understood this, and proposed a law to the Italian Parliament stating that there was an overriding need to take action on capital. For this reason I endorse the report by Mr Newton Dunn, because it tackles this point by stating that there is a need to intervene by chipping away at the funds of criminal and mafia organisations. A section of my group will not support this report, perhaps for reasons that can be understood, because it considers that it does not offer enough guarantees, particularly with regard to the handling of personal data. This section is led by Mr Adamou, the shadow rapporteur for our group, who will abstain and will not endorse this report. I, on the other hand, think that combating organised crime is a priority, but it is not only a matter for the police. We need to take action in the cultural sphere, we need to build a real social structure against the mafia, one that will take on the great burdens of social unrest and unemployment, and we also need to take action in the political sphere. In recent years the mafia and transnational criminal organisations have infiltrated the public administration and politics. This is no coincidence, and I would like to conclude by mentioning the fact that, for example, the president of my region is under investigation for relations with organised crime and the mafia. I would like to conclude by endorsing the paragraph in the Newton Dunn report that calls for monitoring of the activities of those administrations that have been infiltrated by organised crime and the mafia.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it would have been extremely hypocritical if the European Parliament had not debated this issue today, that is, if we had not debated the fact that homophobic public displays and statements have increased in Europe in recent years. The Polish minister’s statements are embarrassing and come in the wake of his Government’s ban on the Gay Pride celebrations. Despite public indignation, the minister has never withdrawn his very worrying assertions. Sadly, this is not the only case in Europe. Displays of intolerance are on the increase in our civilised Europe. We often read about incidents of violence against men and women because of their sexual leanings, or we look on helplessly at the increasingly common cases of serious bullying at school, which can even lead young people to commit suicide, as recently happened in Italy. For that reason, politicians must not show signs of intolerance and they must not issue statements like those the Polish minister made, because by doing so they risk legitimising homophobic attitudes. This applies not just to politicians but also to the Church authorities, who more and more often do not miss an opportunity to show their aversion to homosexuals, branding them as sinners. No kind of discrimination is acceptable and, more to the point, no discrimination based on sexual orientation is acceptable. This Parliament rejected Rocco Buttiglione as a Commissioner because of what he said. I think there needs to be a strong message from the Commission, so that it can keep the promises it made to adopt concrete measures against any form of discrimination. Europe’s history and culture owe a great deal to the sensitivity of men and women who have been persecuted by authoritarian regimes and are still criminalised by reactionary and racist cultures in Europe. We owe a great deal to Sappho, Pier Paulo Pasolini, Oscar Wilde, Michel Foucault and André Gide, and it seems to me a serious matter that, if it had been up to these obscurantist cultures, these great artists would never even have had a voice. I believe, and I hope that Parliament too will agree with me, that a culture that is against homosexuals is unacceptable and should be strongly resisted.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Deprez for the work he has done, which is enabling us to adopt his report at first reading. That demonstrates his ability to mediate with the political groups, the Council and the Commission. I want to thank him even though I maintain all my reservations about this regulation, because I think that in reality its only purpose is to attribute a function to FRONTEX, that useless little agency set up by the Community institutions, which did not perform any function at all until yesterday. I believe that setting up Rapid Border Intervention Teams is merely a propaganda exercise, because it is quite clear that in reality the EU’s illegal immigration crisis is not coming from southern Europe or from the boats that arrive by sea. That is amply demonstrated by all the available data and statistics. Even the Commission says that only 14% of the illegal immigrants living in Europe arrive by sea. I therefore do not understand the need to set up these rapid intervention teams. The same also applies to the southern European countries – Italy, Spain and also Malta, a country that we ought to help. Mr Borg certainly realises better than I do that we ought to try and help Malta, probably by amending the Dublin II regulation, and not by calling for rapid intervention teams that will find it difficult to intervene in that sea area and to tell whether they are in Italian or Maltese waters. I believe, therefore, that we should try to implement a consistent, serious policy on this matter, probably by taking a different approach entirely. That is why I repeat that the only serious function that these rapid intervention teams can have is to save lives at sea. Mr Deprez, the question is not whether policemen are good or bad. It has been amply demonstrated in recent years that disasters at sea are on the increase. There are statistics that show beyond a shadow of a doubt that thousands and thousands of people have drowned in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. I therefore believe that there is a purpose for rapid intervention teams whose priority it is to rescue all the men and women that are trying to reach Europe. It would not be superfluous, in my view, to stress that need in the report we are examining, and I therefore call on the House and Mr Deprez to support my amendment, which unequivocally states that one of the primary functions of these teams should be sea rescue. I think that if we choose this way of thinking we can seriously help to make immigration policy and external border control a joint activity that is useful to the European Union.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his support for our reports, and would also like to stress the importance of this joint debate, since I believe that the future of football is fundamentally linked to stadium security. For this reason, placing the future of professional football together with security in stadiums is a practical way of developing a debate on the future of sport and football. The Commissioner is right to say that in recent years we have seen constantly recurring displays of violence in the stands, and these have transformed the very nature of the sport: the huge number of incidents of violence, displays of intolerance, and acts of xenophobia and racism are signs of a fundamental change in a sport that is one of the best loved and most supported by Europe’s people. Unfortunately, these are not isolated cases but the result of an overall transformation of football, which has now become big business, with clubs quoted on the stock exchange and an astronomical capital turnover. I believe that this factor has significantly contributed to the gradual transformation of sporting events. Football today is very popular and is at the same time a major event, leading telecommunications companies to invest in the acquisition of television rights. I endorse the proposal made by Mr Belet concerning the collective selling of TV rights, which seems to me to be a practical way of preventing the major teams ‘filling up’ on money at the expense of the small companies. There is another factor which is fundamental to football, represented not only by sporting prowess but above all by the presence of the public. It would be unthinkable to have football games without spectators: in some cases extreme measures have been taken which, in my view, have damaged the spectator nature of the sport. Since the presence of spectators in the stadiums is vital, we must insist that football games are always played in front of a crowd, and this means that appropriate measures need to be taken to ensure that the games are played in perfect calm, without displays of violence or racism. The recent tragic events at the Italian football championship premier league match between Catania and Palermo, which resulted in the death of a policeman, are in my opinion the most serious example of what can happen inside stadiums and of how a fringe group of violent fans often clashes not only with opposing fans but also with the forces of law and order. In recent times we have also witnessed deplorable events involving not only fans but also footballers: often the fights between the players themselves have been the very worst form of education and culture to be seen in European stadiums. Preventive action must therefore be taken to avoid the repetition of similar acts of violence in stadiums. Priority should be given to preventive action when football games are being played, as against repression and the militarisation of stadiums. The Council adopted this decision in 2002, establishing a national information point on football, which functions as a point of contact for the exchange of police information in relation to international football games. The results of this measure have been very positive, as can also be seen from experience in the stadiums and relations between police forces. In recent years the number of supporters going abroad to see games has constantly been on the increase and therefore the Council believes it is necessary for the bodies responsible to step up their cooperation. I think this is an important point: the agencies responsible for monitoring the presence of supporters in the stadiums and obtaining data on the nature of organised supporters groups are undoubtedly a useful tool but they must operate exclusively in accordance with national laws and in compliance with European directives and international agreements on the protection of personal data. We must make sure that the large amount of data collected is not used for investigations by the legal system or for other investigations not connected with football, and certainly not as a method of criminalising all fans. Care must thus be taken when the data is being obtained: I think that otherwise the national agencies might change from being tools for preventing acts of violence in stadiums into tools for social control, liable to act in an indiscriminate manner. I therefore endorse the proposal made by the Council to amend the decision we are discussing. We are anxious to ensure that this decision is implemented in full compliance with the law, to ensure that stadiums are not considered to be a territory outside the law, a sort of free zone. National and international laws must apply in stadiums too, precisely in order to ensure that acts of indiscriminate violence and displays of racism and xenophobia are not repeated.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that it is useful to discuss a specific economic instrument to support islands, their special features and characteristics, and I believe that it is useful for cohesion policy to pay special attention to the outermost regions. I believe that we must act to bring about a real improvement in the transport system and infrastructure, external and internal connections and also connections within the islands, for instance between the coasts and the interior, but that we should avoid wasting European resources on monumental, useless projects, often designed to connect islands with the mainland via enormous bridges, which would certainly mar the very idea of island status. While I welcome the drawing up of Mr Musotto’s report, I think that it places undue emphasis on describing a relationship between islands and illegal immigration. There is no relationship. The vast majority of migrants to the Canaries arrive by plane, not by sea, just as the vast majority of irregular immigrants to Italy do not disembark at Lampedusa but also arrive by plane. In my opinion, therefore, this argument is misplaced, and for that reason I believe that this aspect is probably not integral to Mr Musotto’s report. We must also question whether the mobilisation of rapid intervention brigades on the borders may perhaps be more useful in preventing the deaths of emigrants in the Mediterranean rather than in stopping them from arriving.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the need for legislative proposals always to be compatible with fundamental rights may be a good route to a serious resumption of the debate on the real European constitutional process, with no clumsy attempts to revive a treaty that died on impact with the public. I believe that, on the eve of the imminent and still mysterious Berlin Declaration, this may be a serious way of re-opening the debate and of making Europe stand for something once again, and for this I am grateful to Mr Voggenhuber. In recent years, we have witnessed CIA flights and abductions by the CIA on European territory, the systematic monitoring of Europeans and the violation of their privacy, and the detainment of migrants in inhuman and degrading places. All of this serves as the clearest example of the difficulty faced by the European Union when it comes to protecting fundamental rights. We believe that the EU’s legislative proposals should always be fully compatible not only with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but also with the other European and international instruments in the field of fundamental rights: I am thinking of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and of the European Social Charter. We feel that this is a good way to start a thorough debate aimed at the revival of Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are taking an historic step, and for that I should most of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Fava, and the chairman, Mr Coelho, for the work they have done in this committee. Parliament has very carefully pieced together the last few years of the perverse US strategy in the war against terrorism, which was based on the use of criminal methods and violations of human rights. It was only possible to implement this strategy because of the collusion of European governments and secret services. Condoleezza Rice even said so herself: ‘There has been no violation of national sovereignty.’ Some of the responsibility must also be laid at the door of the European institutions, starting with the remissness of Javier Solana and Gijs De Vries. In my view, however, we must also highlight the embarrassing silence by the President of the Commission, who was perfectly aware of US strategy while he was the Prime Minister of Portugal, to the extent that he organised the famous Azores Summit just five days before the start of the war in Iraq. I also believe that another point needs to be stressed: the Vice-President of the Commission stated in this Chamber that he knew nothing about the kidnapping of Abu Omar, which occurred while he was Foreign Minister in Italy. I believed him then and I believe him now, but a new fact has come up in the meantime which, I think, can help clarify matters: Admiral Battelli, the former head of the SISMI, has admitted that the CIA gave him a list of 13 alleged terrorists to keep under surveillance, including Abu Omar. The head of the SISMI must, by law, report to the government, and at that time Commissioner Frattini was the Italian Government minister responsible for the secret services. To conclude, Mr President, the work that we have done has enabled us to bring a good number of facts to light, although there still remain others to investigate. We are confident that today’s vote will be useful in future, not only to say ‘Never again’, but also in discovering who else may be responsible. A great Roman historian once said, ‘They make a desert and call it peace.’ We think that peace is built by avoiding the desert, in other words by avoiding the death of the rule of law for the sake of the false fight against terrorism.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia recently gave us some worrying data that show that acts of racism and xenophobia against minorities are on the increase in Europe. The Roma, who form the largest ethnic minority in the European Union, are particularly targeted. A great deal of discrimination occurs in relation to work and the right to education, and the Roma often live in conditions of poverty, marginalised from society. Sometimes discrimination comes from the very institutions that ought to safeguard people’s rights. In a recent case in Slovenia, an entire group that had been living in that country for many years was removed from the area where it had been living for so long. I believe that we need to encourage the Roma to take part in social and political life, but for that to happen the Member States must first recognise them as an ethnic and linguistic minority. It would be necessary to get rid of the campsite system in favour of types of housing that would facilitate integration, thus eliminating any form of segregation. The Roma have inherited a centuries-old culture, and I believe that we should have great respect for nomadic cultures. We owe to them the birth of what we call Western civilisation, which arose in Mesopotamia, now Iraq and under military occupation, inappropriately stirring up a war of civilisations. We are in debt to the Roma, even though, in my view, civilised Europe has often mistreated and discriminated against them. We must therefore support their social inclusion and freedom of movement. That is why I join my other fellow Members in calling on the Commission to take a more proactive stance – although I realise that Mr Almunia will probably not be able to give us any exhaustive answers since this is not his area of expertise – but we believe that the Commission ought to be moving faster on these issues.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of this directive is to totally liberalise the advertising market, and that means a single kind of television, one that is exclusively for entertainment purposes. It will become impossible to make quality, educational or cultural television. European cultural production will be greatly harmed, and this directive will cause serious damage to the dailies, which will no longer be able to attract advertising. Television often gives rise to superfluous needs, and advertising thus becomes a conveyor belt of induced needs: that is why we need to do more to protect the weak members of society, in particular children. Outrageous as it is, product placement in fact changes the very nature of advertising, which goes from being the essence of selling to the very essence of television broadcasting. The important liberal philosopher, Karl Popper, described television as a ‘bad teacher’. Today, with this directive, the proclamations of the ‘bad teacher’ become proclamations ‘without frontiers’.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs on this report, in particular, Mrs Mastenbroek and Mrs Kudrycka, who have contributed to the final draft. Corruption represents a serious problem for the transparent management of public affairs: it undermines credibility, increases distrust of democratic institutions and jeopardises human rights and the rule of law, allowing organised crime to prosper. Corruption is an age-old problem of which there are many literary accounts: Cicero spoke of it as early as 70 BC. Unfortunately, the cancer of corruption has also gained a foothold in the workings of the European Institutions. It is worrying that the European Union Court of Auditors refuses to approve the Community budget because of serious doubts held over the proper use of funds, and it is equally embarrassing that the Belgian judiciary has opened legal proceedings against Commission employees for alleged payoffs for the acquisition of funds allocated for the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. In the same way, we see the problem of corruption in the use of the Structural Funds, as the funds are often managed for individual gain, or, as is the case in my region, the classifications are falsified, to the extent that the European Commission has had to impose fines of EUR 75 million. This is why we believe that problems of corruption are both subtle and dangerous. The fight against corruption must be a priority for the European Union, and, in our opinion, this Convention should also be signed by all the Member States of the European Union. In addition, we call on the Commission and the Council to take action so that, as well as this Convention being signed, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime is also signed. I believe that this represents a significant contribution towards the fight against organised crime, which is, unfortunately, still on the rise in the European Union. (Applause)

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I note that the Commission’s strategy has changed: before, we used to have such sound proposals, now, even these have disappeared. President Barroso’s speech leaves us very concerned. In fact, as regards the Commission’s priorities for action in 2007, we feel that there is a lack of drive by the Commission to ensure that a practical common policy on immigration is launched. Simply acknowledging that we need to marry security and solidarity does not strike me as a positive legislative principle for 2007. It seems a somewhat empty statement, void of real meaning, which does not contribute to building a genuine policy on legal immigration safeguarding economic immigration and abandoning the current prohibitionist approach that is leading more and more people to their deaths in the Mediterranean or in the Atlantic Ocean, and is encouraging more and more migrants to arrive illegally on our territory and to remain here illegally. I believe that the Commission should provide real drive, by proposing a policy on legal entry to our territory. In my opinion, it is not enough to state that security is a priority, although this may well be true: we also need to agree on what security means. I believe that Europeans should be reassured of the fact that there will be no more illegal flights by the CIA in Europe, that European citizens and asylum seekers will no longer be kidnapped, and that the systematic checks on Europeans will be dropped – I refer to SWIFT, to PNR and to data retention. Therefore, when discussing security, I believe that, first of all, Europeans should be reassured that their rights are being protected. I do not think that the Commission’s efforts are heading in that direction.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that a worthy end – that of the free movement of EU citizens and the abolition of internal borders – is concealing an unacceptable means. The second generation Schengen Information System introduces new forms of social control, and the unlimited use of biometric data will in reality undermine personal data protection. We are concerned because, recently, these data have been misused, with a genuine form of control being exercised. As we have said time and again, we believe that it is unacceptable for these data to end up in the hands of the secret services. We are concerned because an administrative function is being turned into an instrument of police control. While we welcome the commendable work done by Mr Coelho, our group will therefore vote against, since we believe that, instead of debating the free movement of EU citizens, we are debating ways in which they will be completely controlled.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that it is right to extend the powers and activities of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. The data collected over the last few years are worrying: it transpires from the Centre’s annual reports that there has been an increase in drug-related developments. The establishment of the agency in question can therefore help not only to monitor these serious developments but also to vigorously combat them. It is strange that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, as represented by Mr Pirker, is worried about bureaucracy and the rise in costs when we are concerned here with defending fundamental rights. The value of human rights cannot be quantified economically. The protection of fundamental rights is an aspect of our identity, and is perhaps the only way to make Europe strong. I expected an attack – which has not materialised – on the agencies, including Frontex, an agency that has not performed any duties this year, nor helped to improve the lives of EU citizens. I believe, instead, that we must strongly defend the activities and the future of the Fundamental Rights Agency. The problem of duplication does not exist, and even if we were to create some, I would not be worried, because I firmly believe that it can only help to improve the lives of European citizens if there are more agencies, more structures and more institutions that are responsible for protecting human rights. I am concerned about the Council’s absence: only yesterday, the minister left the House and, today, an important debate is taking place. However, I believe that, during a debate such as this, in which two opposing positions – our Parliament’s and the Council’s – are up against each other, it would have been helpful if Council representatives had at least been present in this House. I believe that granting Parliament a powerful role in the establishment of the Fundamental Rights Agency is a positive step, just as I believe that the work of Mrs Gál, Mrs Kósáné Kovács and Mr Frattini, who has reaffirmed his favourable position in this House, is important. However, we must also ensure that there is strong involvement on the part of NGOs and European civil society.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the most honest opinion we can express is that we have agreed to blackmail, since unfortunately Europe has in this matter been subjected to blackmail by the United States; that is to say, the US is dealing with single Member States and airlines, which is why we have in practice been coerced into concluding the agreement in question. This – I repeat – is the most politically correct position, which Parliament must express. However, it is as if we are having to defend an agreement that effectively damages European citizens: it is in fact true that nothing has changed, but the agreement that has been annulled by the Court of Justice was a very bad agreement. We would have to put into the hands of the American authorities 34 personal data items, of which, as the Americans themselves testify, only seven or eight would normally be used. If that is how things are, I do not understand why we have to hand over all this information and, furthermore, to put it in the hands of the American intelligence services – a new feature of the agreement – unless anyone maintains that we can trust the CIA. I do not believe that I am speaking just for myself; I consider rather that this Parliament has every reason not to trust the CIA. What has happened in Europe is clear for all to see: Parliament has even set up a special commission on CIA activities in Europe, and there have been discussions on what happened with SWIFT, when it was discovered that our bank accounts were being inspected by the Americans. I therefore remain puzzled and still believe that we cannot trust the activities of United States intelligence agencies. I believe that the agreement in question was not negotiated in the name of European citizens; it certainly was not negotiated in the name of this Parliament, which was completely ignored in the discussion, as Mrs in ‘t Veld recalled a short time ago. In my opinion we must instead involve the European Parliament, just as we need to involve national parliaments, so that this agreement is reached in such a way as to give priority to defending the rights of EU citizens and, above all, ensuring that our personal data is not put into the hands of persons who will certainly not make fitting use of it.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that, after the failure of last week's Informal Summit in Tampere, the decision has been taken not only to stop pedalling, but perhaps also to lean the bicycle against the wall. Today’s debate also shares this characteristic: the fight against terrorism, the CIA flights, PNR and police cooperation are all being mixed up with immigration. Only when we realise that the topic of immigration must be dissociated from repressive policies, measures to criminalise migrants and the methods used to combat terrorism and organised crime will it then be possible to hold a serious debate on a common European Union policy on immigration. We must also ban from our debate any talk of an invasion: the label 'invasion' is untrue and unfounded; we all know that only 15% of illegal immigrants come by sea from Africa and that all the rest come by land or by air. This is the case in Spain and Italy too, even allowing for the numbers of migrants who arrive in the Canary Islands or Lampedusa. We need to start again using legal channels. As the Commission Green Paper informed us: ‘We need 20 million immigrant workers by 2030.’ So let us take steps to let these people in, instead of leaving them to drown at sea. We do not understand what Frontex did this summer to prevent people from dying. Europe cannot become known for turning immigrants away en masse
, nor can we allow the Atlantic and the Mediterranean to become open-air cemeteries. I have a proposal to make to Mr Frattini: let us build a monument, an eternal reminder of the migrants drowned at sea. In a few months’ time, it will be the 10th anniversary of the first recognised drowning of migrants at sea, when a boat carrying almost 400 emigrants sank off Porto Palo, between Malta and Sicily. Let us make a humanitarian gesture! Let us build a monument, a symbolic collective tomb for the unknown men and women who died at sea because they were seeking a better future. As a great Roman poet might have said, ‘let us build a collective monument more lasting than bronze’. When it comes to holding a serious debate on immigration, this is probably the most powerful, most practical gesture that Europe can now make.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, talks are beginning tomorrow and the paradoxical thing is that we are not even aware of the basis for them. The European Parliament is excluded from these talks about a problem that involves all of Europe’s citizens. This is the first paradox in the affair. My group strongly endorses what Mrs in’t Veld is proposing, particularly the need to change to a ‘push’ system for an agreement in the short term, and the need to avoid the direct transfer of data to the judicial authorities for an agreement in the medium term. I understand the need to use the agreement rejected by the Court as a basis, partly because the United States is demanding even more from Europe. We need, however, to consider the absurdity of certain proposals contained in the agreement rejected by the Court. I am thinking of the 34 data items that have to be transferred to the United States, when we know perfectly well that most of these items are useless: the US authorities themselves say that they have only been using seven or eight of them. Then we ought also to consider the need to establish real, legally binding protection for passenger data, because it is a duty of the institutions to safeguard European citizens’ personal data. Systematically keeping a check on people in the name of the fight against terrorism is an authoritarian distortion of the rule of law and, paradoxically, by doing so we are helping to achieve precisely what the terrorists want. Systematically keeping a check on people is an outcome of the same authoritarian attitude as the CIA’s secret prisons, which President Bush at last decided to announce to the world yesterday rather than continue to hide the evidence. Let us hope that the countries of Europe will also stop trying to outdo the US. We must avoid taking the same stance on this subject and being more extremist than the US in keeping a check on people in the name of this phoney war on terrorism. (Applause)

Mr President, if my fellow Members will allow me, I should like to table an oral amendment to Amendment 6, as tabled by our group. Only yesterday in fact, after the deadline for tabling amendments had expired, we learnt of serious developments in the Italian investigation into the abduction of Abu Omar. We feel that it is logical, right and necessary to update the text of the amendment. Thus, in Amendment 15, after: ‘given that the organisation was organised’
 there must be added: ‘with the involvement of two high-ranking officials of SISMI and carried out with the help of a carabiniere, as highlighted by the recent developments in the judicial inquiry’.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank my colleagues, Mr Fava and Mr Coelho, for the work carried out in this committee and for the fact that this work has shown us that extraordinary rendition is part of a mistaken strategy employed in the name of the fight against terrorism. It is a mistaken strategy because it is based on the theory of pre-emptive war and on the erosion of the rule of law. Rather than weakening terrorism, this strategy has fed and radicalised it, thereby contributing to the achievement of the very objectives set by the terrorists. Just a few days ago, following its Guantánamo judgment, the Supreme Court of the United States told us that, between 2001 and 2003, more than half of the prisoners in Guantánamo were taken there from Afghanistan, which means that Europe was the place of transit for over two hundred prisoners, European airports were used for stopovers, and US and NATO bases in Europe were used as outposts. Our committee has also ascertained that there is no doubt that there have been abductions, including the obvious case of Abu Omar. We have investigated the facts in great detail and have ascertained that, as John Bellinger and Condoleezza Rice have said, US intelligence activity has been carried out with the involvement of national governments. John Bellinger and Condoleezza Rice have explicitly stated that there has been no breach of national sovereignty. This should also be mentioned, Mr Gawronski, not just extracts from Mr Sifton’s speeches. I think it has emerged beyond a shadow of a doubt that European governments have aided and abetted the actions of US Intelligence on European territory. An Italian policeman has confessed and today the deputy head of the Sismi, the Italian intelligence service, has been arrested. I think that we need further clarification. The head of the Italian intelligence service, Dr Pollari, either lied to our committee or did not know about the activities of his deputy; each possibility is equally serious. The same applies to Commissioner Frattini, who should clarify this point. At the time of the events, Commissioner Frattini was Minister for Foreign Affairs, so either he did not know, as he told the committee, or he was unaware of the agreements ...

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we would be making a mistake if we regarded the SWIFT matter as an isolated event. It is a matter that should be seen in a wider context, referring to PNR, to the control of communications and to data retention, and this subject is not unconnected with the topic of rendition that we were addressing just a few minutes ago. In fact I would say that the SWIFT affair is the other side of the rendition coin; it may be a less violent operation, but it has exactly the same purpose: to extract information. The systematic surveillance of the lives of European citizens has now become commonplace and we are facing what George Orwell called ‘Big Brother’, in the name of the fight against terrorism. I think we should conduct an inquiry into the responsibility of the European Central Bank and national banks, since I believe that this situation is unacceptable. One week ago, Le Soir
, the Belgian daily newspaper with the highest circulation, ran a headline: ‘the CIA lays down the law in Europe’. I think that this must be prevented from happening in the name of the credibility and the very future of Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think that Europe’s problem stems from migratory flows; the real problem is not people arriving on our territory, but the large number of people who do not get to Europe, those who die in the Mediterranean Sea or in the Atlantic Ocean. I have heard Commissioner Frattini confirm the need to patrol our coastlines. I believe that they should be patrolled solely to avoid people dying at sea, because the number of arrivals is ridiculously low: in the first half of 2006, 9 000 immigrants arrived in the Canary Islands, as compared with the 8 million tourists who go to the islands every year. I do not think that migratory flows have a very high demographic impact and we should, therefore, avoid talking about an invasion of immigrants and should try to develop a common policy for the entry of immigrants. Europe, however, has adopted a repressive joint policy, setting up administrative detention centres, implementing a joint policy of mass expulsion often determined at G5 summits and applying the principle of externalising frontiers, which, it seems, will be the main topic for discussion at the forthcoming summit in Rabat. I am of the view that we should radically change our strategy, with a view to true integration, based on the need to institute a mixed-race identity for Europe, and that we should also consider citizenship through residence, a residence permit to enable people to find work, harmonisation of the right to asylum and the right of immigrants to vote. I think that this new method of looking at immigration can help Europe in its constituent process.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to speak about a serious incident that took place only a few hours ago: 18 emigrants have drowned while heading for the Canary Islands, and another two emigrants were found dead this morning at the Melilla fence, between Morocco and Spain. According to a statement made by a representative of the Melilla Government, the two people would appear to have been shot dead. We, in this House, have already previously denounced the Spanish civil guard's use of firearms on immigrants. The Spanish daily El Mundo 
claims that handguns have been used in an intimidatory fashion to deter immigrants who wanted to cross the Melilla border. Mr President, we believe that all of this is very serious and we would ask you whether it is possible for the Bureau to ascertain the truth of these claims, with a view to determining whether it is true that the Spanish civil guard has used firearms to prevent immigrants from being able to climb over the Melilla fence. We feel that all of this is very serious and we believe that the European Parliament should urgently intervene on this matter, with a view to preventing further deaths at the border between Morocco and Spain.

 Madam President, this Parliament has called for the closure of the Guantánamo detention centre on several occasions and we continue to call for it today. Human rights are being violated there, torture is the order of the day, and we have even discovered recently that 60 children have been unlawfully held in Guantánamo. Guantánamo is a place outside the law, where terrorists or suspected terrorists are detained and thus kept out of reach of normal judicial process. Guantánamo is a symbol of the victory of barbarity over the rule of law, but I have to tell Mrs Plassnik that Guantánamo is unfortunately not an anomaly: it is just the tip of the iceberg, because in recent times the idea has been to fight terrorism by using the same barbarous methods that terrorism uses, and that is leading to our defeat. If we think of how the war is feeding international terrorism, we will have a clear idea of what is happening at the moment. Terrorist attacks are the most obvious sign of the shift from the rule of law to the rules of the jungle. We must therefore reassert democratic rules; we must reassert the primacy of politics and uphold the rule of law. It has been decided instead to fight on the enemy’s home ground and to compete in denying human rights, in using military might to control the civilian population, in negating the cardinal principles of democracy, and in giving priority to security above all else. The pictures from Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib prison are emblematic of the victory and culture of terrorism over the rule of law; they are a clear sign of the defeat of those who often declare that they want to fight terrorism, not least because those pictures shown on television around the world are the staff of life for extremist fundamentalism, as are the secret prisons or the kidnappings carried out by CIA secret agents on European soil. We must not be accomplices or casual observers of such barbarity. I shall conclude by saying that the idea of using any means possible to defeat terrorism is a mistake. There is only one way to defeat terrorism: by safeguarding the rule of law.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of citizenship is central to the revival of the European Union’s political project. There are no shortcuts to revitalising Europe’s role on a global scale. What it needs is for a real constituent process to be created, avoiding attempts to revive a constitutional treaty that has been killed off and erased by the will of the people. We need to build an intercultural society emphasising Europe’s mixed-blood identity and, above all, we must encourage the integration of immigrants and the extension of citizenship rights. That is why we also think that the European citizenship concept must be tied closely to residence, with the explicit aim of encouraging inclusion. In that respect, we believe that the ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme can be a useful and valid means of promoting European citizenship rights, which should be increasingly dissociated from national criteria. The programme’s actions are worthy of support, and I refer in particular to town twinning projects and active European remembrance. I believe we need to be clear on the latter point, however. The 20th century was one of wars and authoritarian regimes, and there were countless victims of the deportations and mass killings carried out by the Nazi and Stalinist regimes. Twentieth-century European history cannot be commemorated, however, without remembering the victims of its Fascist regimes: in Italy, Fascists deprived men and women of their freedom for two decades, and there are many connections between the Italian regime and the Nazis. Spain, Portugal and Greece only recently won back democracy and freedom. Antifascism is a European value and cannot be reduced to a national event, and we therefore believe that it is now worth remembering the victims of Fascism to prevent similar events from happening again. There are still neo-fascist groups in Europe today, who feed on xenophobia, homophobia, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism. Excluding the victims of such authoritarian regimes from the programme would be both tragic and a threat to the promotion of citizenship and a common European identity. We therefore hope that Amendments 62 and 63 will be adopted.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to thank my colleagues from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for having nominated me and asked me to be the rapporteur for this visit that we carried out in Malta. As rapporteur, I can only maintain that the situation in the immigrant detention centres in Malta is simply terrifying: it is a real Dantesque hell in which the immigrants are denied even their most basic rights. We visited three detention centres in which we discovered downright inhuman and degrading conditions, unworthy of a civilised country: unacceptable hygiene conditions, promiscuity, pregnant women detained until the fourth month of gestation, terrible food and cold water showers, toilets without doors and rubbish and squalor all around. Maltese law is abominable: it allows for 18 months of administrative detention for citizens who have committed no crime whatsoever. I believe that that is truly excessive. Furthermore, I believe that the treatment reserved for asylum seekers runs counter to the Geneva Convention and to the European directives on asylum. The migrants do not receive any information, and their asylum applications are not analysed until eight or nine months have elapsed. In Malta, even refugees from war zones, in particular Darfur, are being refused asylum. I was struck by the sight of a man who had a card on which was written ‘genocide in Darfur and detention in Malta’. Europe cannot remain silent over this dreadful situation, and the visits by our committee to the temporary detention centres in Europe lead us to believe that the policy on the reception of migrants needs to be radically changed. First and foremost, we need to widen the legal entry channels, turn the matter into a Community one and amend the Dublin II agreements and, lastly, close all the administrative detention centres located on European soil. They are legally unacceptable places in which all human rights are being violated.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe must be in a position to guarantee and protect the quality of its agricultural and food production. In order to achieve this objective it is necessary to defend traditional specialities and geographical indications, even against attacks launched from inside the World Trade Organisation by the United States and Australia. The rapporteur has done an excellent job to improve the two regulations. We need to protect products in order to have a real impact on improving food safety and prevent the homogenisation of flavour, which is occurring on a global scale. All too often, sadly, we find examples of counterfeiting: the largest market in southern Italy, Vittoria in Sicily, is every day flooded with counterfeit products that are put on the market as protected geographical indication products, for example Pachino cherry tomatoes. For this reason, we believe that labelling is needed to reveal the indication of the place of origin and processing of a product. We must question ourselves, however, over one matter: all too often those in favour of the PDO and PGI scheme are more concerned with commercialisation than with production.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to assess the European arrest warrant a comprehensive analysis should be made of the effects that the framework decision has on legal cooperation, the mutual recognition of offences, respect for individual procedural guarantees and civil liberties. Unfortunately, we are currently experiencing considerable problems, with some Member States having had difficulties in applying the warrant because they are actually hindered by their national constitutions. It would, however, be a mistake to think about distorting national constitutions in order to make the arrest warrant work. Today’s evaluation, unfortunately, has had to do without data from one country: Italy, which, in order to protect private interests, due to a decidedly Eurosceptic and anti-European ministry, has not transposed the EU legislation by the required time. Finally, it is not possible to think of creating a European arrest warrant without first establishing common minimum standards for criminal procedure and without putting in place shared procedural guarantees. Parliament has already expressed an opinion on minimum procedures, and we are waiting for the Council to go forward on this point. It has been like building a block of flats starting with the roof instead of the foundations. In fact, the European arrest warrant can certainly be a useful tool in removing the extradition of criminals from the political arena, and there have already been some positive examples on this point, but the procedure is vitiated by a fatal flaw, an original sin that has sprung from the haste of having to react to terrorist attacks by enacting emergency legislation. I wholeheartedly agree with the evaluation put forward by Mrs Hazan in her report. The text has been improved in committee, and we have also avoided extending the list of 32 offences, but our judgment cannot help but spring from the erroneous starting-point brought about by the obsession with security. There is an old Italian proverb that says ‘more haste, less speed’. This applies perfectly to the evaluation of the first year of application of the European arrest warrant.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the granting of citizenship and the rights associated with it is a prerogative of the Member States. European citizenship is an emerging concept, a right deriving from national citizenship. The fact that each country has different procedures for granting national citizenship means that there is no uniform procedure for acquiring European citizenship. This report, for which I am the rapporteur, does not call the Member States’ prerogative into question: the right to citizenship and the granting of citizenship are their prerogatives, as expressly laid down in the Treaties. The times are perhaps not yet ripe for harmonisation of the procedures for granting citizenship, as I realised even during the debate in committee. Nonetheless, I believe it would be extremely useful and, indeed, necessary to begin a period of reflection – in the medium to short term – on the real and effective value of the idea of European citizenship. In my opinion – and not just mine but that of most of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs – the only way to endow the idea of European citizenship with real value is to link it closely to the idea of residence. European citizenship by residence is a very important issue, and thousands of associations and thinkers who have taken part in this debate have already submitted a petition to implement it. European citizenship by residence can be included alongside the other procedures for acquiring citizenship – that is, citizenship by bloodline (ius sanguinis
) or by birthplace (ius soli
) – which are provided for in many European Union countries. I believe that granting citizenship by residence is a way to eliminate and avoid certain paradoxes. Just think, for instance, that someone may be considered a European citizen – rightly too, perhaps – if he or she was born to Italian parents, lives in Argentina or Venezuela and has never set foot on EU soil, whereas someone else may not be considered a European citizen – unfairly, in my view – even though he or she has lived and worked in a Member State for 10 or 20 years but was unfortunately born to Tunisian or Egyptian parents. I believe that bloodline, birthplace and residence may, together and at the same time, constitute valid grounds for granting citizenship rights. Affirming that a person may become a citizen of the European Union after five years’ legal residence in Europe seems to us a practical way to reopen the debate on the future of Europe, which, since the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty, has plunged into a crisis that may prove fatal and irreversible. Certain rights associated with EU citizenship are already conferred on the basis of residence: I am referring to the right to petition the European Parliament and the right to submit a complaint to the Ombudsman. Thus the right of free movement and residence and also the right to vote in European and local elections might be extended, in the same way as these rights are granted to EU citizens residing in a country other than their own. That would be an important step towards integrating all those non-EU citizens who live in Europe legally. I also call on my fellow Members who belong to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to support this position and to give up excessively extreme positions. The document I am putting forward not only received the support of my group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in committee, but it also had the support of the Commission, whose members told the Committee on Civil Liberties that they were in favour of implementing citizenship by residence. Commissioner Frattini has also said he is willing to give support of this kind. I believe it is a very important step, which has also obtained the approval of a great many social and trade union organisations within civil society, both religious and secular. I am referring in particular to two major Italian organisations: Caritas and a major Catholic trade union, the CISL, which have publicly come out in support of this report to introduce citizenship by residence. Finally, I should like to reassure all those who, in their comments on this report, have raised the spectre of introducing a European tax in order to extend citizenship rights. They even include the Italian Prime Minister, who wrongly claimed during a recent television broadcast that this Parliament wanted to introduce a tax in order to extend citizenship. To dispel any doubts – although I do not see any threat in this report – I propose that we remove the explicit reference to a European tax and concentrate exclusively on the citizenship-by-residence concept. I hope that doing so will also help to deprive those who are afraid to extend rights in Europe of their excuses.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to inform Minister Alexander that today we are not talking about the fight against terrorism, but about hundreds of flights throughout Europe, about kidnappings and torture carried out by the CIA against European citizens or refugees, and about torture practised in prisons on European soil. All of this has already emerged from certain elements of the Council of Europe investigation. Commissioner Frattini quite rightly calls on us to look into these events more thoroughly because we have to be able to prove them. There is an emblematic case which itself contains all these elements and which demonstrates that evidence does exist for all these events. It is the case of Abu Omar, who was kidnapped by CIA agents right in the centre of Milan, transferred to an American base in Italy and tortured for 12 hours; he was then transferred to Egypt, where he was detained and tortured for more than a year. He was finally released and warned not to talk about the abuse and violence he had suffered. He disobeyed the order and 22 days later he disappeared and has not been heard of since. All that is proven by the clues left behind by the CIA agents who kidnapped him: intercepted mobile telephone calls, calls home, calls to CIA headquarters, hotel credit card payments and even details left on the computer with the route taken by the car. In my view, all these points need to be looked into; there are 22 arrest warrants out for CIA agents, and we are still waiting for the Italian Government to issue the extradition requests. Clearly, therefore, the Italian authorities knew about the Abu Omar case, and it is also clear that a great many European governments know about these events. Indeed, the agreement signed between the United States and the European Union in Athens in January 2003 states that the use of transit sites for the transfer of foreign criminals needs to be stepped up. I believe that we have to find out the truth; we have to find out about the torture and detentions; we have to find out about the flights and transfers. A committee of inquiry needs to be set up to shed light on all these points. We have a duty to find out, and that will be for the good of Europe, because it cannot preach human rights and yet tolerate violations and abuse.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was wondering why the UK Presidency wanted to fast-track this directive at all costs. Clearly, its keenness to achieve at least one result in this disastrous presidency has also determined the debating time for this directive. I should like to express my solidarity with Mr Alvaro because I believe that the compromise amendments tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have made the text put forward by the Commission worse. Basically, they demonstrate two things: first, Parliament’s subordinate position in relation to the Council and, secondly, that the major German coalition also casts its shadow over this Parliament. I believe that this directive is disproportionate, because it places security above freedom and democracy. We are faced with a slow, gradual and inexorable shift away from the rule of law towards a police state, and this Americanisation of the European Union has to be stopped by every possible means. We have asked a single question: ‘Can you demonstrate to us that data retention can curb terrorism?’ We have not been given an answer.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Italy has been at the centre of today’s debate; in the wake of the Zoro case, it is not considered an offence to say ‘dirty nigger’. The political responsibilities in all of this are clear. A footballer even came on to the pitch exalting fascist symbols. I believe that all this comes down to a clear responsibility on the part of the political authorities, which increasingly tend to criminalise immigration. By way of example, I should like to mention a very serious incident that took place only two days ago: in Italy, a Moroccan citizen, who was suspected of being a dangerous terrorist and had been subjected to two trials and acquitted both times, was expelled from Italian soil because he was judged to be a threat to national security. I believe that this is a serious matter, insofar as we have no precise details about where this Moroccan citizen ended up; it would appear that he is now being held in a Moroccan prison in which human rights are notoriously overlooked. I believe that the Member States must not be party to acts of torture carried out in non-EU countries.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the politician Francesco Fortugno was murdered by organised crime in a region of Italy only a few days ago. That also says a lot about the level of disagreement and difficulties within Europe regarding the fight against organised crime. I come from a land where judges, politicians and trade unionists have been mown down by Mafia gunfire and where the current president of the region is on remand for having links with the Mafia. I therefore believe that the problem needs to be tackled in all its complexity and that the seizure of assets is pivotal: it is a law that has been very successful in Italy, even though only 1% of the Mafia’s assets has been seized. I also believe that these assets should be reused for social purposes, thus returning the ill-gotten gains to society. In addition, I do not think that the Mafia and organised crime can be beaten just by military action: it will also take political and social measures. In my view, therefore, there is no point in creating a new European police force, whereas it is appropriate to establish democratic control over the activities of Europol. (Applause from the left)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is the duty of the Presidency of Parliament to uphold the honour of its Members. It has been claimed that in this Chamber there are political exponents and representatives of institutions with links to criminal and terrorist organisations. I believe claims of that kind are unacceptable and I therefore call on the Presidency to take precautions to prevent speeches of that kind and to adopt whatever measures are needed to uphold the honour of the Sinn Féin delegation, which belongs to our group. I consider all that to be unacceptable and believe that the Presidency of Parliament should also intervene to penalise speakers who fail to respect the honour of the European Parliament and its Members.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although I hold Mrs Klamt in high regard, I am actually very glad that most Members do not share her views on this subject. I am also pleased at the opinions expressed by the Committee on Development and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, as well as the fact that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has substantially changed the approach proposed by Mrs Klamt in her report. Similarly, I am delighted at the fact that Commissioner Frattini has clearly set out a position supporting the way in which the Committee on Civil Liberties has acted on the report in question. This method of consultation chosen by the Commissioner to develop the action plan is, in my opinion, highly significant. I should, however, like to emphasise one point. The Green Paper states that between now and 2030 Europe will need a further 20 million immigrant workers in order to maintain our current economic standards and to make up for the population decline. The nub of the question is this: will these 20 million immigrants be regular workers or not? Do we want them to remain illegal or do we want to regularise their situations and incorporate them into a healthy labour market? That is the problem we have to face. In my view, since the measures used so far to curb illegal immigration over the years have driven it underground, a residence permit for jobseekers and the right to vote are the best way to ensure that these 20 million workers will work in Europe legally.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is hypocritical to talk about immigration today without discussing the double barrier separating the enclave of Melilla from Africa; this barrier represents, in symbolic terms, the failure of our approach to building a Europe of peace, social justice and intercultural co-existence. Only two days ago, a delegation from our group was able to see for itself the barbaric nature of this place: a militarised border, a terrifying spot that acts as a great divide between hope and death. It is a sort of reactionary utopia to think that one can curtail the free movement of men and women with the barbed wire separating two continents. It is a selfish folly to create a physical barrier between prosperous and comfortable Europe and the relentless desperation of those fleeing hunger and war who, instead of being welcomed and assisted, are pelted with the rubber bullets of the Spanish Guardia Civil 
and the Moroccan army. The Spanish Government bears joint responsibility both for the mass deportations carried out by the Moroccan Government and for the deaths in the desert of dozens of people. On that point, the accusations made by many non-governmental organisations operating in Ceuta and Melilla are serious, and on behalf of my group I call for a committee of enquiry to be set up immediately to find out the truth and who was responsible for what happened in Ceuta and Melilla, as well as to investigate the way in which immigrants are received in Europe. It is unacceptable in political and legal terms, as well as in ethical and human terms, to have mass expulsions from European territory. The immigrants who have climbed only the first barrier at Melilla, without managing to get over the second, have been expelled from European territory without any kind of recognition, without any attempt to find out their origin and without any check as to whether they might have been entitled to refugee status. The Commission’s conduct with regard to what has happened is unacceptable: confining itself to preaching the protection of human rights, it is behaving like the three monkeys: it does not see, it does not hear, and it does not speak about the many violations committed by the Member States. Spain has acted as Italy did when it carried out mass deportations from Lampedusa to Libya, with immigrants being abandoned in the desert as a result. It is deplorable that the Council is talking today about enhanced cooperation with Libya when it should be demanding that Libya ratify the Geneva Convention. All this, however, is being swept under the carpet. The Lampedusa and Libya incident, which was considered to be a highly serious irregularity, is now becoming usual practice. This Parliament, which condemned Italy and its government for the criminal act of deportation to Libya, must now act consistently, which is the reason why we are calling on the groups which voted with us for the resolution on Lampedusa to now draw up a resolution condemning the events in Ceuta and Melilla. We cannot accept a principle whereby Europe grants the rights guaranteed by international and Community treaties only to the strongest and luckiest immigrants who have succeeded in climbing over the second barrier as well, since such rights should not be governed by a natural selection mechanism. That would lead to Europe becoming – as Thomas Hobbes said – a state of nature. The right to be received should be an inalienable right. A decent and humane reception should be provided at the Melilla processing camp, which would, unfortunately, be in contrast to the reception provided on Lampedusa. We were able to ascertain – as confirmed by an investigative report by the biggest Italian weekly paper – that human rights are being systematically violated on Lampedusa. We believe that it is not possible to build Europe with barriers and barbed wire: what we need to do, instead, is to try to open the borders to ensure that Europe has a future and a hope of success.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as others of my fellow Members have done, I too should like to thank my friend and colleague Mr Kreissl-Dörfler for the serious work he has performed and for the difficult attempt to put together a report on which we can all agree. Unfortunately, the Council has already made up its mind, and we take note of that, as we do of its absence here today, and it will most probably take no account of any suggestions emanating from Parliament. I think that the Kreissl-Dörfler report improves the directive put before us, particularly in that it deletes the part about super-safe countries and increases the margin for appeal against any refusal. Some major unresolved issues still remain, however, which we cannot sidestep. I am thinking in particular of the role of consular authorities, who should not be allowed to meet asylum seekers under any circumstances. There remains the issue that asylum seekers should not be held in detention centres. We have just visited Lampedusa and seen how the mixing of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants generates barbaric relations inside detention centres. In our opinion, these people should not be held in the same places; indeed, we believe that asylum seekers should never be shut up at all. If it is absolutely necessary, steps must be taken to ensure that they are not held in the same places and in any case not for six months. In addition, we are concerned about the use made in the report of the safe third country concept, about the criteria for defining a safe third country, and also about how the list of such countries will be drawn up. To us this is an extremely important point: by definition, a safe third country obviates case-by-case assessment, in that we delegate our responsibility to another country that is considered safe according to rather flexible criteria. Asylum is not a concession: it is Europe’s moral and political duty and a right for men and women who are being persecuted or are fleeing from wars. Which are these safe countries? According to the criteria, even Morocco or Belarus, for instance, could be considered safe countries, places that we have chosen to consider privileged partners, and this also results in a process of externalising the Union’s borders. I believe that safe third countries and the concept of safe third countries endanger the lives of asylum seekers, and that is something that we must not allow. I also believe that Parliament has too little control; codecision will only apply when modifying the list of safe third countries. Mr Frattini says that the report has been arranged step by step. In my view, this step has not been bold enough: we could have aspired to and demanded much more. The harmonisation that we have produced is probably such that it even makes some national legislations worse.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we agree on the fact that terrorism is the enemy of humankind, and we are concerned that after the London attacks the matter is back on this Parliament’s agenda, partly because in June it had been discussed in a number of reports and also in connection with the subject of data protection. The fight against terrorism must not be associated with the fight against illegal immigration or with asylum policies, as it has been by Mr Clarke today. Drawing such a parallel is specious and, at a pedagogical level, dangerous: does anybody seriously think that terrorists arrive in Europe on board makeshift boats? In my opinion, victims should not be turned into killers: migrants are the weak link in a system that sustains terrorism, but they are certainly not the cause of terrorism. Moreover, if the extent of tragedies can also be measured by the number of deaths, then terrorism should not even be considered a priority for the European Union: the real tragedy in Europe is the number of migrants who drown in the Mediterranean Sea because of our laws and practices that turn them away. The number of those who go to their graves in the Mediterranean is a thousand times greater than the number of deaths caused by terrorist attacks! A serious omission hangs over this debate: Mr Clarke and Mr Frattini represent the two European countries that have most contributed to the war and the military occupation of Iraq. Their analysis is wrong if they do not see the relationship between the war and terrorism. Their analysis is wrong if they do not see that the war and terrorism fuel each other, just as Islamophobia and Islamic fundamentalism fuel each other. The phenomenon can be seen not only in Iraq. According to a study recently published by a UN agency, over the last three years, that is since the military occupation started, opium production in Afghanistan has grown exponentially: the drug is the main source of funding for the terrorist organisations. Terrorism will not be beaten by war or even by this obsession with security, so proposing an Orwellian system of surveillance of Europe’s citizens is unacceptable. Data protection is a means of making security prevail over freedom and justice. Stefano Rodotà, a respected lawyer, has stated that data protection is like torture for the third millennium: the aim of both is to extract information. I fully agree with that view and that statement. Furthermore, it has not yet been shown that data protection helps to defeat terrorism, nor do I believe that the two examples that the UK Presidency put forward in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs are sufficient. Finally, I believe that certain initiatives require the consent of Europe’s citizens and that it will not be easy to build a consensus on this issue. I do not think that the European Union should try to get out of its crisis by using this distortion of security. The European Union will only succeed in becoming a strong and institutionally credible political force if there is popular consent for its model of society, and I believe that that is the lesson to be learnt from the French and Dutch referenda.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a sword of Damocles hangs over this debate, in the shape of the financial perspectives of the Union, which have a decisive influence on the definition of the EU cohesion policies. The cohesion policy is the best instrument for reviving the role of political Europe, whose crisis is often caused by neo-liberal choices and the militarisation of the area of freedom, security and justice. The rapporteurs have carried out some excellent work in drawing up fresh methods of achieving the objectives of the new cohesion policy. I should like to thank in particular Mr Fava and Mr Andria for the work they carried out. In order to be able to plan the future, however, an assessment also needs to be carried out of the impact that the Structural Funds have had on businesses and the economy in the weak areas of Europe. Often, in fact, the Structural Funds did not help to improve the quality of life of citizens in underdeveloped areas, but rather were a matter for the mafia, were handed out according to a system of patronage or were utilised in order to cover holes in budgeting, and at times they were not even spent. Whilst a debate on the amount of funding is necessary, thought must also be given to the quality of spending.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first sentence in the strategic document on national defence approved by the United States in March 2005 states: the United States and the world are fighting a war. That is the ideological premise that has given rise in recent years to the theory of preventative war, the violation of individual freedoms, the end of personal data protection, and the fixation on security. Terrorism is an extremely serious crime that must be condemned and combated. It cannot be combated by military means, however, and I believe, therefore, that Europe must distance itself from that approach. We must carefully analyse the spiral of war and terrorism, because the military response has strengthened terrorism, and we cannot sidestep this issue. In Afghanistan, the military occupation has generated exponential growth in the production of opium, which is funding the al-Qa’ida network. In Iraq, the war has boosted the strength of terrorist groups, not all of which are religiously motivated, and that is the reason why we need to remove the anti-Islam fixation from some of the reports being examined in this House. Such a fixation also reveals a cultural subordination to the United States. President Bush has, in fact, asked Islamic regimes to limit, control and record all charitable donations made by Muslims. We, however, cannot look upon not-for-profit organisations as the main source of terrorist funding, as do some of the rapporteurs in this House. We must avoid making overly simplistic equations along the lines of terrorism equals immigration, or terrorism equals Islam. Terrorism must be combated and defeated: the aim is noble, but the methods are all too often improper and sometimes criminal. Terrorism is a crime against humanity, but I do not believe that it is necessary to single out an International Criminal Court as the place for trying such crimes, partly because at the same time it is unacceptable that nobody judges the massacres of civilians during military actions. All too often sovereignty relieves the prince of criminal liability. An influential expert in law once said that the legal history of the Western State is that of instilling the notion of its innocence in criminal acts. I believe that in order to combat terrorism, we must re-examine the old legal proverb that says that the king is never wrong.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mr Moraes for his fine work in preparing this text, because we have a real need in Europe to protect minorities and to generate practical initiatives against discrimination. I imagine that at this very time all Members have been subject to real lobbying by EU citizens, even asking us to scrap some of the paragraphs in the Moraes report. We often profess to be champions of the minorities, before then demonstrating such hypocrisy when it is a question of religious freedom or of recognising free movement and homosexual marriages. Some subject-matters are taboo: there is news today, for instance, that even in Catania, a civilised Italian city, an Italian citizen was refused a driving licence on the grounds of being homosexual. I believe that this fact also speaks volumes about the level of guarantees that we have to put in place against discrimination, and that it is also useful to launch an initiative aimed at ensuring that, with regard to minorities, genuine acts of citizenship, and not just tolerance, are guaranteed.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too thank Mr Gaubert, who has worked in committee to draw up this report, which in my opinion raises three important points for tackling the issues involved. The first point is to increase the legal immigration channels; the second point calls on us to act on the causes of immigration and not to respond with repression, criminalisation and rejection; the third point demonstrates that the economic approach may not be the only one in the area of immigration. I believe that the Gaubert report must contribute to the drafting of the Green Paper. I believe, moreover, that it is necessary to try to adopt the proposals put forward by our group, in particular with regard to residence permits for job seekers, the rejection of the Community priority – because there can be no difference in job seeking between citizens of the European Union and citizens of third countries – and, finally, the right to actively participate in political life and in elections. I will conclude by expressing a concern: Parliament is carrying out interesting work on immigration whilst the Justice and Home Affairs Council has recently approved closer cooperation for managing migratory flows with Libya, which has now become a privileged partner of ours in the area of immigration even though it continues to offer no guarantees with regard to respect for human rights and safeguarding the right to asylum.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mrs Gál on the important work she has carried out, because the creation of this agency for the protection and promotion of fundamental rights is a valuable body both to this Institution and to the European Union. An independent body is required, which also has strong links with the European Parliament. It is also important that, on this issue, codecision processes can be arrived at between Council and Parliament. Another important aspect, moreover, is monitoring the situation with regard to fundamental rights violations in third countries. All too often we are helpless bystanders and all too often our cooperation links pave the way for fundamental rights violations to take place in third countries. I believe that the difference between this agency and the European Court of Human Rights should be highlighted. The European Court intervenes in individual cases, whereas the remit of this agency will be to monitor a political system in its entirety, and to also monitor the legal instruments that may not comply with universally recognised standards in the area of human rights. I believe that we are dealing with an extremely important matter, because all too often we, as Members of the European Parliament, report instances of human rights violations without having the means to prevent them from recurring. Today, for instance, a boat sank off the coast of Lampedusa. If it had been the first time, we could have considered it to be an isolated incident. In contrast, such incidents occur all too often and it is necessary, therefore, to carefully assess the legislation in force.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Nassauer has undoubtedly produced a good report, to the extent that a decision has already been reached with the Council at first reading. I would like, however, to highlight certain aspects that give rise to further thought. We are debating the third directive without a clear insight into what have been the effects of the second directive. This excessive and erratic haste, which should have led us to assess money laundering also in terms of the fight against terrorism, has, in my opinion, led us to rush through the process, when further reflection was required. In particular, I believe that excessive attention has been paid to the matter of suspicion, when perhaps we should concentrate more on certainties, by ensuring individual guarantees. The second aspect, which, in my opinion, remains unresolved, concerns the thorny question of lawyers. On this matter, I believe that the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs forcefully lays down some points for reflection that Parliament must consider further.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 8 May 1945 was the date that heralded the end of the Second World War, but it was also the date that sealed the end of the Fascist and Nazi dictatorships in Europe. On that day, Europe liberated itself from the spectre of authoritarianism, and that date also heralded the beginning of a Europe aspiring towards peace and social justice. Europe was liberated by the resistance of men and women, partisans who built the institutional and moral foundations of this Europe. Europe was liberated by those who fought at Stalingrad; it was liberated by American and Canadian Allied troops, and equally by the Soviet army. That date can be regarded as the foundation stone upon which a new Europe was built. That page of history is, unfortunately, all too often subjected to revisionist plunder and attacks, and even this debate is marred by an unmistakeable revisionist impetus. By indistinctly muddling 8 May 1945 with the crimes of Stalinism, we do a disservice to the commemoration of the Liberation of Europe. I should like to be clear on that point: in terms of political beliefs, personal data and cultural development, 
myself and my group have no problem in firmly condemning the horrors of Stalinism; however, in this debate, people are seeking to surreptitiously bring to life the theories of Nolte, which equate Nazism with Communism, and not only with Stalinism. In truth, the values of peace and social justice were, in that short century, threatened not only by Stalinism, but equally by colonialism, by imperialism, and by neo-liberalism: from Algeria to Vietnam, from the shelling of Belgrade to the massacres of Sabra and Shatila, up to the events of 11 September 1973 in Santiago del Chile. We must do right by history: the memory of the past is a crucial gift in enabling us to contend with the future and to build the horizons of this Europe. There is only one way to strengthen Europe: we must ban the term war from our vocabulary. Europe must play an active role in building a peaceful world, stretching from Iraq to Afghanistan, and to Palestine. To conclude, Europe has to be more courageous and authoritative; we must reverse the famous Latin saying and forcefully assert si vis pacem para pacem, 
or ‘if you want peace, prepare for peace’. That must be our guiding light.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Vice-President Frattini for being here today. I feel that what he has told us reveals a number of good objectives, but all too often the means for achieving them are not the most appropriate. I refer in particular to the need to fight illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings. All too often the fight has been carried on by means of summary judgments and expulsions, at times violating the non-refoulement principle and even denying people the right to asylum. I am referring in particular to the fact that on 14 April this year Mr Frattini met the EU Home Affairs Ministers to strengthen cooperation with Libya for the purpose of fighting illegal immigration. I have personally witnessed the treatment to which illegal immigrants are subjected in Libya – including those who are sent back there from a European country – and I have witnessed blatant violations of human rights. I ask whether the European Union intends to make use of such measures to fight illegal immigration.

 Mr President, Mr Frattini, Mr Schmit, ladies and gentlemen, mercy was buried, the supreme values of humankind were buried and God died behind that iron gate. The symbols of Nazi savagery and the evil frenzy of persecution came to a head in the death camps and the most heinous crime in the history of the twentieth century was perpetrated there. Auschwitz represents both time and space, the geography and history of terror, murderous barbarity and homicidal madness, a cold-blooded torment of hatred beating down on the homeland of the Enlightenment and Positivism, in a Europe that had taken leave of its senses. The madness of the concentration camps was generated by a ruthless rationality, a perverse idea of a world that had to eliminate critical cultures, make standardisation prevail and see diversity as the arch enemy. The Memorial Day cannot be a mere commemoration; it cannot confine itself to being a rhetorical remembrance of a monstrous event; it cannot just be summed up in the image of that soldier who discovered the horrors of Auschwitz. On that day the first stone was laid in building a Europe of peace, a political entity that should have destroyed the word ‘war’, roots and all. We have come a long way, but there is still a long way to go in a Europe that has yet to speak out clearly and decisively against war and which is often struck dumb, while the man of our times is, in the words of a great poet, ‘still the one with the stone and the sling’; he continues to kill through exact science geared towards mass destruction. Remembrance is not enough, but we must use the same energy and unceasing determination to take a stand against the violent impulses of anti-Semitism, racism and Islamophobia. We must put up effective, official barriers to the spread of gender, sexual and ethnic discrimination. The whole world as well as Europe is criss-crossed by contagious germs, which spread together with ideas about preventive and permanent war, in other words the dogma of the clash of civilisations and the new crusades against the infidels. Auschwitz is not just a place buried in the memory of the historiography of Nazism; Auschwitz is also fear and terror about what the future will bring.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European Union’s anti-drugs strategy, which is on the agenda for debate, ought to operate exclusively through a scientific approach, through an analysis of the actual situation and of the experience on this issue built up over recent years. In contrast, unfortunately, the argument is all too often permeated with ideologies and dogmatic or emotive approaches. The data available to us allow us to take a practical approach. I refer, in particular, to the data supplied to us by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, based in Lisbon. As is well-known, these data are not only of high scientific value but also of proven reliability. The 2004 report by the Lisbon Centre indicates that the situation regarding deaths from heroin and heroin users in Europe is, all in all, stable but that no decrease has been seen in the transmission of HIV, which is even spreading in some new Member States; that the consumption of cocaine is increasing in the majority of Member States; that cannabis is the most widely-used substance, with over 20% of European citizens having used it or currently using it; and that the use of ecstasy is as high as, if not even higher than, amphetamine use. All this unequivocally demonstrates that the strategies adopted up to now have not had positive results. With regard to drug use in prisons, the Centre indicates that drug users are over-represented in prison; that the use of drugs among detainees ranges from 22 to 86%, depending on the prison population, the prison and the country; and that prisons are a high-risk environment for the spread of infectious diseases. With regard to the criminalisation of drug use, the Centre explains that in many Member States the process of criminalising the use of narcotics has led to an increase in the use of these substances. I should point out to my Swedish fellow Members that the Centre’s report contains a specific reference to the situation in Sweden, where a study is cited which shows that with the repressive strategies in force in that country the drug market has intensified; it concludes that there is no specific proof for the argument that the criminalisation of drug use has a deterrent effect on young people. Finally, with regard to drug trafficking, Europol indicates that narcotics trafficking accounts for approximately 2 to 5% of world GDP, which goes directly into the hands of drug traffickers and large criminal organisations worldwide. The US drugs agency estimates that in 2005 Afghanistan will export over five thousand tons of opium, of which 95% will end up in Europe. This demonstrates that the action plan adopted by the UN in 1998 has not had positive results, and this is also true in terms of the importance of drugs in funding organised crime and terrorism. A prominent prosecutor, Gerardo D'Ambrosio, has explained to us that to finance the Madrid attack the Al-Quaida terrorists bartered 250 kilograms of hashish for the TNT. Our report, which has been adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, is therefore based on the need to fight drug trafficking, organised crime and terrorism and to give priority to saving lives and protecting health. The issue must not be treated as a question of public order or a matter for repression, but exclusively as a social and economic issue. For these reasons we have focused the report on the issue of the strategy for harm reduction and substitution treatment in prisons, as well as on the need to apply scientific knowledge to the effects produced by drugs, to launch scientific studies on the costs and benefits of the current policies to curb narcotics, to help producer countries to convert their agriculture, to study the effects that cannabis, opium and coca leaves can have in the medical sphere and, lastly, to take action on the confiscation of criminal and terrorist assets derived from money laundering and drug trafficking. I therefore call on the European Parliament to adopt this report, on the Commission to back it and on the Council – which is unfortunately absent, having clearly already made up its mind – to consider including this recommendation on the agenda for the meeting to be held in three days’ time. I would also like to mention that this recommendation was put together with the support of many organisations.

 Mr President, although I partly welcome what the Commissioner has said in this Chamber, I believe the various issues need to be examined more carefully. The first issue, as far as Colombia is concerned, is the policy begun by President Uribe. Only a few months ago, a respected US weekly, Newsweek
, put a photograph of the Colombian president on its cover and claimed that when President Alvaro Uribe was at the US Defence Department in 1991, before he was president, he had links with the Medellín drug cartel and was a friend of Pablo Escobar. As if that were not enough, President Uribe’s policy in recent years has consisted exclusively in encouraging the paramilitary forces, so much so that a few months ago he invited the paramilitary leaders to Parliament, demonstrating that he is only prepared to talk to one side in this war. Even the relatives of Ingrid Betancourt have claimed that it is President Uribe who is opposed to any humanitarian exchange. In recent years the national security policy has focused on arbitrary mass detentions, the criminalisation of social conflict, massacres of trade unionists and violations of human rights. We believe that the European Union should not declare its neutrality in this context but should rather encourage the search for a political solution to the conflict and the cessation of military hostilities, which President Uribe is currently promoting. We should make every effort to achieve compliance with the London Declaration of July 2003 and the recommendation made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in March 1994: let us remember that it is in fact the Colombian Government that has failed to keep to the agreements. Lastly, with regard to international and European cooperation, it should be noted that peace laboratory funds all too often end up in areas totally controlled by the paramilitaries. I believe the Commission and the Council should bear this in mind to a greater extent.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate that President-in-Office Balkenende should have begun with the dramatic events in the Netherlands, which have disturbed that tolerant country. The Netherlands of integration, even if that word was completely absent from today’s discourse by the President-in-Office. I did not appreciate at all, however, the fact that today no mention was made of the grave events in Iraq. Yesterday, devastating images of American marines killing injured Iraqis were bounced into our homes, as if all this barbarity and horror were routine business not even worthy of mention. I believe that Europe cannot stand idly by at these events, nor can it confine itself to voting appropriations for reconstruction – as the Council did recently – nor limit itself to meeting Mr Allawi or placing confidence in the forthcoming elections as the event that will resolve the conflict. As regards the Hague Programme, I do not consider there to be continuity with Tampere; on the contrary, I note a qualitative leap based on a misapprehension. The fact is, the issues of organised crime, terrorism, trafficking in human beings and immigration cannot all be thrown into one big pot, as if they all constituted a single problem. What this is in reality is a scheme for limiting Europe’s sphere of action to that of security, leaving out justice and freedom. I believe that Islamic terrorism should be combated by dialogue between cultures and religions. That is not what was done by your deputy, Mr Balkenende, who the day after the murder of Mr Van Gogh declared war on Islam, or what your country does in financing faith schools. I believe instead that we must build a school where Catholics, Muslims, Protestants and atheists can all live together. In conclusion, trafficking in human beings and immigration are not the same thing. We need to punish the criminals, but above all we must satisfy people’s needs: the needs of those who flee from wars and from hunger, who come onto our territory, seeking shelter in our sympathetic and integrated Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I address myself to you, Mr President of the Commission, by paraphrasing the first of Cicero’s speeches against Catiline in the Senate: quousque tandem abutere patientia nostra signor Barroso?
 Do you wish to abuse our patience for the next five years? You continue to say that you will rely on the support of Parliament and then, by sleight of hand, you present us with a team that does not answer the questions posed by this institution in any way whatever. There was a Dutch Commissioner criticised for her conflict of interest and there still is; there was a Hungarian Commissioner who was inadequate for Energy and who has been promoted to Taxation; there was an Italian Commissioner for Justice who has been rightly removed and another Commissioner, an Italian again, for Justice, to emphasise that the government of that country – whose Prime Minister has notorious judicial problems – needs to be protected by your Commission. You know, President Barroso, that in the matter of justice the conduct of the Italian Government, of which Minister Frattini is still part, has provoked a joint strike of magistrates and lawyers. Finally, let Parliament be the judge of how the Commissioners have replied in their hearings and I assure you that the letter of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on Commissioner Frattini is by no means a pass with full marks. An answer please – how long do you want to abuse our patience?

 Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council has talked a great deal today about the need to have a safer Europe. We believe that before we have a safer Europe we ought to have a more democratic, freer and more welcoming Europe. On the subject of guaranteeing the right to asylum, a number of abuses and illegal acts have in fact been committed recently: from the Cap Anamur affair to the Lampedusa deportations, to the latest song and dance about the 13 Kurds who landed at the port of Augusta. All too often there are breaches of the Geneva Convention on non-refoulement
, asylum seekers are hastily identified, and abuses are committed that even extend to the use of handcuffs, as we saw recently. The Council that will be meeting next week on the subject of freedom, security and justice will clearly be constrained by the decisions already taken by the G5 in Florence last week. In this context, I should like to ask what opinion the Presidency of the Council holds on the use of biometric data in passports and visas, and what the Council’s position is on the establishment of reception camps outside EU territory.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is inconceivable that we are discussing the Maldives when this name evokes for us all holidays and a scene of paradise. In reality, there is systematic violation of human rights on these islands. We are faced with a situation in which women and children are denied their fundamental freedoms and, most importantly, a process of arbitrary mass detention of many citizens is under way. I think that the European Union must promote a widespread initiative to support an awareness campaign for European citizens in our countries, so that they do not go on holiday to the Maldives until light has been shed on the tragic human rights situation and on the systematic violation of democracy in that land. I think that a firm resolution is needed, aiming at ensuring, inter alia
, that the Maldives really are a paradise, but a paradise in which democracy and the respect of human rights prevail.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will focus on the Globalisation Adjustment Fund. Our discussion of this fund is taking place in the midst of an extremely powerful and dramatic economic and social crisis, as other Members have already mentioned. Although it is a good idea for the fund to be used more directly as part of measures to cushion the blow of unemployment, as we have been saying, we need to have a deeper discussion of its role and the context of the instruments required to tackle the crisis. Firstly, we must take care to ensure that the emergency does not proliferate and therefore make it clear, for example, that whoever takes public money from Europe is obliged not to dismiss employees. Then we also need European crisis intervention measures to guide structural choices at this particular juncture in the automotive sector; this concerns Italy and our relationship with the United States and Germany. Secondly, we need industrial and environmental policies, but also cohesion policies, that put an end to dumping within Europe. Thirdly, the resources are woefully inadequate, especially when compared with those deployed by the US government, for example. Buffers are no use: we need a radical change in policies.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the failure of the Working Time Directive was inevitable. The Council maintained a provocative position, as we heard in this House earlier, by ignoring the parliamentary vote, which was then repeated at second reading, years later. It is with that vote that we go before the electorate – I would like to say to Mrs Lynne – since we do in fact have a mandate from the electorate. The worrying thing is the subject of that extremism. The Council wants to keep both the opt-out and the yearly calculation of working time. The 78-hour week, I would point out to the Commissioner and to the Council, is arrived at by postponing the rest periods provided by the text that the Council has defended. It therefore represents a worse situation than the previous directive; frankly it is difficult to understand what concept the Council has of work and working conditions, but also of trade unions and contracts. If we continue with the opt-out approach, if we do not work towards harmonising working conditions, then we are not working for Europe, but against it, in other words we are creating conditions that weaken the social fabric of Europe and prevent it from tackling the real reasons behind the current crisis. The responsibility for the failure therefore lies fairly and squarely with the Council. Parliament has done its duty.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to send John Bowis my sincerest best wishes. The litmus test of this directive is its legal basis. If it is a matter of guaranteeing everyone the right to receive the best treatment anywhere, what does the legal basis of the market have to do with it? The right to health should form the legal basis. What is more, the right to health should above all provide for the right to receive the best treatment in one’s own country, which would be subject to European quality standards, not hiding behind subsidiarity. If the market forms the legal basis, however, you might think that it is intended to Bolkesteinise health and look after the interests of insurance companies or those who want to profit from health. It therefore beggars belief that parliamentary amendments even on the key issue of the legal basis risk being deemed unacceptable, and that calls for an essential clarification also from the Commissioner before the vote takes place in this House.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first comes grief for so many innocent victims, then a commitment to rescue efforts, overcoming the emergency and reconstruction, in which Italy gives of its best. European assistance in this is important, but we also need a European framework to help to prevent these disasters, which often have more than just natural causes; we therefore need a prevention framework, a natural disaster warning system on which to build a civil protection and prevention network. In addition to this, we need a land policy that provides guaranteed standards on land use that respect its balance, as well as safe building standards. The Abruzzo earthquake also involves this, and, without wishing to be controversial, we must investigate all the liabilities, so that we can avoid a repetition of these serious events, and above all we must focus on land reclamation rather than on new demolition works. For this reason also it is vitally important that the Soil Framework Directive be adopted, which will provide structural support for appropriate management of European land, and European funds should be reformulated in line with prudent land policy, thereby creating a healthy environment and good jobs.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that, in the face of the major changes affecting the musical and cultural sector in general, Europe risks responding with protectionist solutions and outdated schemes, promising crumbs to performers and small music companies and instead ultimately furthering the interests of the big stars who will have considerably greater opportunity to increase their profits. You see, in the wake of the Swedish court’s judgment against the managers of the website The Pirate Bay
, who were punished for having encouraged peer-to-peer sharing of musical material, Parliament’s approval of a measure of this kind would consolidate a negative and altogether inappropriate approach to the new dynamics of the current technological era and the need of entire generations for culture, communication and freedom. The protection of artists’ freedom of expression in fact lies in their relationship with society; the freedom to produce art and the freedom to enjoy it go hand in hand and have a common adversary in the mercantile subservience of culture that would be strengthened by this legislation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to thank the rapporteurs. A label that is ecological but also sustainable: this is the challenge of the new framework regulation on the Ecolabel. The regulation is a first step. The European Parliament and the Council have carried out profitable and constructive negotiations, at least with regard to aspects concerning chemical substances. It is now the turn of the Commission to develop the criteria established, implement a working plan and define an initial list of products in operational terms within one year. Individual Member States must organise the competent national authorities, liaise with the European body and adopt the sustainability criteria as binding. What does environmental sustainability mean for the Ecolabel, though? It means applying innovative production criteria throughout the production cycle: from reducing emissions in production methods to reducing the energy consumption of primary assets such as water and locating production centres near end consumers. All this amounts to nothing less than a revolution. This is the challenge demanded of a credible attempt to combat climate change but also a true revolution in manufacturing methods. In order to develop these criteria, the Commission and the new Community body are called upon to ensure the active involvement of leading operators and best practices, so that they can make use of innovations tried and tested by these operators during their manufacturing cycles and thus make them accessible and transparent. Respect for social working standards is an integral part of these criteria, even though the regulation still contains a legislatively unacceptable term due to incomprehensible pressure by the Council in the final negotiations. The term used is ‘if appropriate’: in sustainable development, social clauses and regular work cannot be an option applied only ‘if appropriate’. The exclusions to be applied to the ecological quality label for products that still contain toxic chemical substances, that are harmful to the environment, that are carcinogenic or that are damaging for reproduction are, however, clear and effective. But on a note of caution: the European Parliament’s control over this will be particularly unbending.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate on the car industry is unfortunately too late in the day and also inadequate in content. In fact we are debating when decisions have already been made by the national governments outside any real European framework, and there have already been tragic social consequences in terms of unemployment and unemployment benefit. Staying on this subject, the text of the resolution does not propose any fundamental elements for ensuring that the measures to be taken are effective and fair. I should like to point out that, a few months ago, when dealing with climate change, Europe acted very differently, treating it as a real political issue. It is not doing the same with the economic crisis. It has given a free rein to the governments which have acted in a disjointed manner and, I would say, also with an eye to winning votes. This is of course due to the political weakness of the Barroso Commission, but also to the difficulties involved in tackling situations that call for new powers with decisions relating to industrial, social and employment policies. Can we accommodate nationalist measures? Can we sustain a wave of redundancies when aid is being given to firms? Can relocations in the car industry and associated businesses continue to take place, as they have done in the case of the Italian firm ITONO and now with Indesit, which is in another fundamental sector? Can we extend the scope of the European funds without increasing them? On this basis, it is not enough to say that this is a car-industry problem and that so many meetings have taken place. We need to set guidelines for action, by which I mean that firms must not lay people off when they are being given aid, that the aid must be linked to innovation as laid down in the climate-change package and the Sacconi regulation, and that relocations and competition between EU Member States must stop. My group has tabled amendments on all of these points. In other words we need a new policy, one that this Europe does not appear to have and one that we must create before social hardship becomes so severe that we cannot give our workers any definite answers.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, two years ago, we held a debate in this House and adopted an exacting resolution on the subject of water on the occasion of the Fourth World Forum held in Mexico City. We wrote then that water must be considered a human right and that active policies must be developed to realise this right through forms of public-private cooperation, focusing, in particular, on local communities. Unfortunately, that resolution was not supported by the European Commission, which was present in Mexico City – I would remind the Commissioner of this today – despite the fact that it was widely praised by many countries, especially in Latin America. The very nature of this kind of forum, a private structure, unfortunately prevailed. We now have the opportunity to send a parliamentary delegation to Istanbul, and it would be advantageous if our presence there were supported by an equally strong resolution as that of 2006: we are not quite there yet, which is why I am tabling these amendments. We need to reach a real turning point on the water issue. The terrible statistics on water shortages are well known, and they are destined to get worse as a result of climate change. Indeed, it is in the area of climate change that new action is needed. Climate change is making access to water more difficult, and poor water access in turn aggravates climate change. So, as well as the rights issue, and that of public-private collaboration, we also have to look at building a strong relationship with the Kyoto Protocol. It is the UN that must be involved at the heart of matters concerning water. A dedicated UN body could be entrusted with global water governance, removing it from the private philosophy still present in the current forum. This would encourage connection with the important conventions on climate change and desertification that form part of the UN framework. Appropriate finances will then, of course, be required. These could come from general taxes and charges, for example, on mineral water which – I would like to point out to my fellow Members – we use to excess even in this Parliament. The privatisation of water must be opposed: it would make access to a vital resource no longer a right but a market. I believe that the whole history of Europe teaches us that it is the public that has guaranteed the right to water in our homes, which does not happen on other continents increasingly prone to infiltration by the private sector. These are practical matters, but they also have enormous moral importance. It is not by chance that the right to water is championed by large secular but also religious movements and celebrities. Recently, and many times over the last few years, the European Parliament Chamber has been made available – rightly, and I thank the presidents for this – for important meetings of global activist organisations. At the latest of these, the idea was put forward of a true protocol on the right to water, which I am convinced we should all support.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although this is a consolidation of several directives and there are therefore limited possibilities for amending the legislative text, this new IPPC Directive is a necessary and useful tool for promoting not only a dramatic reduction in emissions by taking advantage of best available techniques, but also for precipitating a new trend in industrial investments. With the attention to detail and input of all the shadow rapporteurs and, first and foremost, the staff and the rapporteur, Mr Krahmer, whom I would like to thank for his honesty and patience, we have maintained complete transparency in adopting the BAT, exchanging information and publishing the operative conclusions of these documents on the Internet. We have ensured that the participative consultation procedure established with the Seville Forum will continue. It is important that we do not wander from this course; I would appeal to all the rapporteurs to maintain the consistency we have demonstrated in months of open discussion. I myself worked on the soil protection directive. We are unfortunately still awaiting the Council’s opinion on this directive that is crucial for maintaining a natural balance in the release of carbon into the atmosphere, as Commissioner Dimas rightly said recently. Certain amendments, including in the draft IPPC Directive, aim to undermine the mandatory reclamation requirements for disused industrial land: they do not intend to link the provisions to the other requirements to be introduced by the soil directive. All this is, in my opinion, unacceptable, and not for environmental reasons, but in order to safeguard public health and prevent any misuse of public resources in the development of business and the life of EU citizens. In the past, including in Italy, there have been too many such cases of infringement of the permits laid down by the previous IPPC Directive, leading to discrepancies, both from an environmental perspective and in terms of market and industry rules. My country has already paid a high price for uncontrolled industrial development involving Seveso, Eternit and others, with consequences for the landscape and local people. To conclude, I welcome the limitation and inclusion of provisions on incinerators. Regulation in this area must not be watered down, so that we can prepare to move beyond this practice towards a zero waste society. The amendments discussed by all the groups to permit stricter controls on furan and dioxin emissions are also justified. I think that in this light we should consolidate this debate with a House vote. This is an important directive and I hope it will be adopted.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Florenz on a job well done; this report is a tribute to his consistent presence, attention and contribution. It reflects the input he has made to the work of the committee, which has been skilfully chaired by Mr Sacconi, and has looked at the issues in depth, debated, and above all contributed to the part this Parliament played in adopting the climate package. President Pöttering, I too would urge you to consider how our work can and should continue in the run-up to Copenhagen. For now, as regards the Florenz report, I think it would be a mistake to unbalance it with what are, at this point, ideological amendments on the question of nuclear power. They are unreasonable, out of context anywhere other than in the minds of their proponents, and alter our joint position. I would, however, ask my fellow Members to consider the inclusion of an amendment that I have tabled on the relationship between climate change and water. I believe this to be a valuable field in light of the growing attention it is receiving from international organisations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the United Nations Environment Programme, which have highlighted this area as decisive for the future, and also in view of the upcoming World Water Forum in Istanbul.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has become clear that the financial crisis has deteriorated into a terrible economic and now social crisis. We can see this from the car sector, where, I agree with Mr Sacconi, we can presume that more than 2 million jobs are at risk. There is a danger that the crisis will result in redundancies, especially among the most vulnerable, that is to say older workers and those who lack permanent contracts. Swift, firm action is needed. Assistance is available, but we have to decide – and I say this quite frankly to the Commissioner – whether it should be coordinated at European level or otherwise, as certain larger states seem to be proposing. I would argue that European coordination is required, and that it should be directed towards two areas: innovation, in relation to the climate change package and, if I may mention it again, to the Sacconi emissions regulation, and the social sphere. It is my belief that no worker, from the old to the temporary contractor, should be laid off. Innovation cannot be achieved by getting rid of the workers. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund should also be adapted in this light; likewise the European Social Fund – why not? – which currently speaks of creating new jobs but should also seek to avoid redundancies. Labour must then be restored to its central place in Europe, to play its due role as the founder of democracy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the dialogue on these measures – the pesticides directive and regulation – has been very difficult. Parliament rightly insisted on legislation that would be effective and suitable for the task. There has been debate in Parliament, but above all strong resistance in the Council, and economic powers have been mobilised in force in defence of vested interests. We should, in fact, be concerned with general interests. Consumers should be able to eat foods uncontaminated by residues, citizens should be able to enjoy an environment unspoilt by these pesticides, and farmers should be able to work safely and towards a new quality of product. There is an excessive use of chemicals in agriculture that damages all these things – our food, the environment and farmers are all forced to pay a high price for this industrial produce. The abuse of chemicals is linked to an old model of agriculture, where value is placed on quantity rather than quality and where produce becomes disconnected from the land, the seasons and the workers. It is a costly model for everyone, a harmful model also, because of the impact it has on the greenhouse effect. The legislation we are adopting is thus part of a movement to establish a more modern, healthier model of quality agriculture that meets the needs of citizens and the environment, with a greater commitment to labour and generating greater income. I have to report that our efforts have borne fruit, thanks to the perseverance of both the rapporteurs and all the experts who worked together with their counterparts in the Council. The objective of reducing pesticide use, and not only the dangers associated with it, has been added to the list of commitments to be met under the respective national plans only. This chiefly concerns high-risk substances. If priority is thus to be given to non-chemical methods, to the defence and integrity of the soil and water supply, avoiding any contamination of common resources such as water, then individual countries must have a sense of this great responsibility to reduce pesticides and move to sustainable use. Aerial spraying is virtually prohibited and – where there are no viable alternatives – local people must be notified in advance of the composition, times, intensity and schedule of the spraying. Progress has thus been made with regard to rights to information too, and access to data via the Internet. We did want the regulation to abandon the idea of three rigid zones, but the Council did not agree, and so it has been retained. The outcome is nonetheless significant; these are measures that will be adopted to fight the contraband in illegal, counterfeit and dangerous substances, as well as others. We are taking a real step forward and I hope that the parliamentary vote will not come to blows!

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking in this House today, President Sarkozy gave an honest account of the nature of the compromise on the climate package. Effort sharing is part of this compromise. The point of any compromise is to see what develops, in what direction it is headed and whether it can meet the challenge. Looking at the scale of the environmental and economic crisis, we cannot help but be concerned that so much has been watered down. The way things are going, if we listen for instance to the words of the Italian Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi, it seems as if there has been a desire to leave things the way they are, deceiving people almost: that is what lies hidden behind the so-called unanimity of the states that Mr Sarkozy spoke of. We know that Mr Berlusconi’s words were propaganda, because that is not the reality of how things work with this package. On the contrary, much credit is due to Parliament, which has been not only more European, but also more advanced than the Council and the Member States. The issue, then, is not just one of balance among the institutions, but of the dynamic among them. Parliament should be awarded a greater role precisely because we are in need of more democracy. For this reason, we will use our votes to demonstrate our loyalty to the parliamentary texts, and I would like to say before this House that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has worked admirably to reach an advanced stage and that on this matter, contrary to what Mr Goebbels said, Mrs Hassi has been particularly skilful and effective.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the word from the United States is that they are genuinely considering nationalising the big automobile groups in order to tackle the crisis facing the industry. As always in the US, at certain times ideologies are laid aside, including the doctrine of laissez-faire, and very practical steps are taken. Europe cannot just sit by and watch while the motor industry is in crisis. Of course it is important to pass the new emissions regulation, it is right that the Commission should say that the environment and innovation should guide the measures to address the crisis and that the motor industry should be cited in this, but that is not enough. I would ask you to consider, Mr President, and also the Council and the Commission for their part, whether what we need is in fact a truly extraordinary plan to take immediate action, before the dismissals and redundancies proliferate; they are already numerous in Italy, in my country, and are hitting large groups, from Eaton to Fiat itself.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow there will be a large trade union demonstration in Strasbourg against the real coup that the Council has pulled off with the Working Time Directive. A working week of sixty-five hours plus is patently absurd, it is unacceptable, as is the infringement of collective rules and trade union agreements. Far from overcoming the system of opt-outs, of individual agreements on exemptions, these are in fact set to become the general rule. Working time is calculated on a yearly average, thus creating extreme flexibility, and rest periods are also made uncertain and at the mercy of company agreements, as if we are to consider inactive working time as partial work, partially recognised and partially paid – this is unacceptable. The policy of excessively exploiting workers, while there are so many people out of work, is a symbol of the devaluation of labour itself that is so much a part of the crisis we are facing. Parliament would do well to listen to tomorrow’s demonstration and to react to this coup by the Council, not least to reaffirm its own sovereignty.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a report, a brief one this time, a few days ago, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change announced that CO2
 emissions have again started to rise faster than was forecast. Therefore, we too need to speed up our decisions and ensure they are satisfactory. Parliament, as certain fellow Members have pointed out, has worked intelligently, competently, and I would even say passionately, and has already adopted important texts in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. We expect the Commission – and I have no doubts about it as I respect Mr Dimas’ work – and the Council, to acknowledge the value of this work. We are in codecision, and must therefore meet the deadlines and reach agreement prior to the next session in Strasbourg. We must not undermine our commitments, but uphold Parliament’s fundamental points, such as effective cuts, the automatic switch from 20 to 30%, the creation of an adaptation fund and technology transfer to third countries. Europe must play a decisive role in Poznań, remembering, among other things, that it is in Europe’s own interest to secure a post-Kyoto agreement with China and the USA. I am deeply saddened, as an Italian, that the government of my country and Confindustria have taken such a reactionary and harmful position, first and foremost for my country. To say that the economic crisis makes taking action on the climate impossible is foolish; on the contrary, combating climate change is precisely what our point of reference for a green industrial reconversion must be, and which must lie at the heart of our action during this dramatic crisis. The environment is not a problem for the economy, but the key to its solution, along with a different social approach to a crisis resulting precisely from a sick economy that harms the environment and employment.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, only a few days ago in this very Chamber President Sarkozy told us that the crisis that we are experiencing is structural and that what is needed is a rethink of capitalism itself. Naturally, I think that rather than escaping from the crisis of capitalism we need to escape from capitalism in crisis; in other words, we need to start to think about a new future which provides for a genuine transition to an economy which is described in social and ecological terms, an economic democracy based on equity and cooperation rather than on inequality and war. Above and beyond these substantive differences, however, which do count for something, I can see that very little remains of the solemn statements on the rethinking of capitalism in the rather modest and fairly disappointing outcome of this G20, for which Europe also bears some responsibility. Certainly, it has been discovered that laissez-faire
 dogma can be falsified and that therefore there can be huge public intervention and even nationalisation, but all this will not change the underlying philosophy that created the structural crisis. Certainly, it is said that we need rules to reduce the risks of speculation, but there is no idea of intervening with regard to this financial speculation – for instance with a Tobin Tax on transactions – and we are not touching the Stability Pact that, in this time of recession, is likely to dramatically worsen lives in this continent of ours. However, most of all, we are not asking ourselves what lies at the bottom of this crisis and so we are not succeeding in tackling it. I would point to just two issues: the first is the systematic devaluation of work that has been pursued with laissez-faire
 policies over recent decades, which has ended up by creating, as well as injustice and suffering, a significant part of the lack of financial liquidity. In 1929 John Maynard Keynes proposed that we should invest in salaries and jobs, but today this is not being done. The second is the ecological and energy dimension of the crisis, which calls for decisions that are much clearer and starker than the stammering of the G20, but on the other hand it is very difficult for those who created the crisis to resolve it. We need a clear, different signal from the left.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry that I cannot share the optimism of fellows Members, since I am convinced that this directive may well do more for business than for health: a kind of Bolkestein
 directive, but on health. The crucial point for Europe has to be that every citizen must have the right to the best possible treatment in his or her own country; the sacrosanct right to be treated anywhere will otherwise mask the fact that treatment is not available at home – something that cannot be put down to questions of subsidiarity. It also masks the interests of those keen to speculate on health, providing big business for insurance companies and increasing costs for citizens as well as European health spending. A directive which is, in my view, mistaken, because it pays no attention to harmonisation, to the universal nature of the service that Europe must ensure, and is not based on the notion that health is a right which has to be guaranteed by the public sector and not left to people’s ability to take out private insurance. The unions are rightly very concerned and we are concerned with them.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry but I have to criticise some of the compromises reached as, in some cases, they run the risk of undermining what Parliament very rightly voted for at first reading. I am also sorry because these changes for the worse have been imposed by the Council and are mistaken and dangerous. I say this from my own standpoint, living, as I do, in Italy. In this case, Italy unfortunately offers a bad example of waste management, failing to respect the spirit and the letter of European law under which a virtuous hierarchy, ranging from reduction to recycling, has for some time been consolidated. That hierarchy has to be strengthened by quantified and certain targets – for reduction and recycling – for industrial waste as well, and not weakened, as is to some extent the case, by leaving scope for disposal policies which undermine its philosophy. Italy has, for instance, offered billions of euro in incentives for waste incineration in recent years, with results that are evident to all and can in no way be seen as positive.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like very briefly to endorse my colleague’s request. We have here a very serious incident in a reactor which has already experienced problems in the past. Maximum transparency is required, not least because we know that shutting down a reactor and making it safe is no easy matter. As far as my country is concerned, we are just a few dozen kilometres away from Slovenia, which moreover currently holds the presidency.

 Mr President, colleagues, my great thanks go to the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, because he has worked hard and has assessed several months’ work by the Temporary Committee on Climate Change under the expert chairmanship of Guido Sacconi. The key political point which leads me to agree with the Florenz report is the acceptance of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a body and therefore of the UN and the Bali Conference guidelines. Note that this is not just a scientific point, but a point of democracy; it is a forum for world democracy. Now the issue before us is that if Europe seeks to be a credible, driving force in the post-Kyoto agreement we must have our house in order. The package of measures set out must be approved within a specific period, and in line with the Bali undertakings, in other words the package must be one which abides by the commitments, as well as being transparent, in place and verified. It is essential that we prevent exceptions and derogations which give rise to non-credibility within Europe and in relations with others. We must prevent any jiggery-pokery by Member States and the business world, in other words we must be serious!

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Commissioner Špidla: we are facing political acts and events of unprecedented gravity. The directives and declarations of the European Parliament must apply to everyone, even Italy. We say this to the current government, whose acts and declarations on taking office cause us real concern and have shocked us. We also said this to the previous government. The fight against discrimination and the commitment to integrating the Roma is enshrined in parliamentary votes. The rights of mobility and residence are pillars of European citizenship. Europe must facilitate the implementation of its decisions. As a European minority which was persecuted by the Nazis, the right to citizenship of the Roma must be recognised. I consider what has been happening of late to be extremely serious: this is political exploitation of fear, for example of Romaphobia, to win electoral consensus; fear as a basis of vote-winning. In the process, politics and democracy are being stifled, peaceful coexistence is being poisoned and the very civilisation that Europe is called on to nurture is being destroyed. This discussion must produce concrete results: the monitoring of action by the Member States, the monitoring of local action and the monitoring of the living conditions of Roma citizens.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall focus on two points. Even today, billions of people have no access to water and hundreds of millions are dying as a result. Climate change is bound to worsen the situation. The price will be paid mainly by continents such as Africa, which are already enduring terrible conditions and, even though they pollute less, are harder hit by climate change. The right to water must become a top priority for adaptation policies. I say ‘right’ because this right has still not yet been sanctioned. International documents refer to the ‘need for water’, whilst real military and economic wars are being waged with a view to appropriating water and turning it into a commodity. It is therefore necessary to sanction the right to water and pursue policies enabling that right to be implemented. In this sense it may be useful – and here I am addressing the Commissioner – to draw up a water protocol for inclusion in the text of the post-Kyoto agreements. Along with water goes soil. We have a European directive in need of approval. We must combat desertification and promote the role of the soil as an agent of climate balance: that is the thrust of our directive. Good agricultural practice, unlike for example the production of biodiesel, can guarantee both food output and carbon capture. Adaptation, therefore, does not mean surrendering to climate change but intervening to combat it.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as always when someone acts outside international law, Europe is divided and undone. Unilateral acts create very serious precedents, and we have now heard what Mr Borghezio had to say. Tension is heightened in an atmosphere that is anything but calm and is full of geopolitical comparisons. Europe is lacking unity, authoritativeness and transparency. We have even read of meetings between the government currently holding the Presidency of Europe and the United States Administration, which has suggested the lines to be taken. It is no accident that this Parliament is politically impotent today, despite the celebrations for the new Treaty. The only way of turning the page is to go back to international law and an independent vision that sees the whole of the Balkans in Europe, recognising the right of the whole area. I hope it is not too late.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s decision to come and present its proposals to this House is significant. It is a positive sign that Europe takes the issue seriously and aims for the kind of fair response that we have helped to flesh out. However, for this very reason I wish to say, with all sincerity, that I have my doubts about some aspects of these proposals and cannot endorse them. I refer to the excessive share of biofuels, despite growing misgivings in many quarters. I refer to the risk that some people will be able to equate nuclear with a clean and renewable source of energy, which it is not. I refer to the over-reliance on carbon capture technology rather than other, better practices. Finally, I refer to the waivers on emission limits for polluting countries or sectors such as iron and steel. In this way we risk sapping Europe’s credibility, rather than reinforcing it in a crucial phase like the one initiated by the Bali Conference. The ground rules were laid down in Bali for signing a post-Kyoto agreement. In order to achieve this – and we must – there will be a need for considerable political will and the capacity to construct a complex scheme, but also consistency. Political will means regarding climate issues as an acid test for Europe and for a different type of globalisation. Consistency means moving towards the 20/20/20: reduction of emissions, energy efficiency and use of renewable energy. We therefore need to identify a package of priority measures to be approved over the coming year, before Parliament is dissolved and new elections are held. Over and above the 20/20/20, the package must include measures on vehicles and aircraft that make the general reduction pledges credible, partly by means of vertical policies. To this extent, waivers in sectors such as iron and steel would be a big mistake. We also need to build in the complexity needed for a strong agreement, one calling for a new globalisation scenario based no longer on competition but on cooperation and technology transfer. In addition, it is crucial to explore novel ideas, such as Mrs Merkel’s proposal on calculating per capita emissions, and to think about adjustments affecting in particular continents like Africa, which pollute less and are much harder hit by climate change. It is by this yardstick, the plight of Africa, that Europe’s contribution and dedication will be judged.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Barroso said, the Slovenian Presidency in itself represents a historic achievement and this allows us to reflect on the relationship between Europe and the Balkans region. This has certainly been subject to criticism, partly because of the aspects of disintegration which it has involved, and Europe should now counter this by promoting peace and rapprochement, encouraged by the very relationship with Europe. That is why we should avoid unilateral action on Kosovo, on which there should be a common European policy, as the new treaty, in any case, states. We need to tackle the problems of the new external borders which have arisen as a result of some countries’ accession to the European Union. We need an active policy for social, economic and environmental integration which encompasses the entire area, and frankly I do not see nuclear power as a solution to energy problems. Finally, I would like to remind the Slovenian Presidency of the problem of the ‘erased’, that is, those former Yugoslav citizens who still have citizenship problems in Slovenia, so that it may be definitively resolved.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the substance of what Commissioner Dimas has said, reminding us all of our responsibilities and pointing us in the right direction; he reminds us that the way in which the problems should be addressed is one of compliance with European rules, moving away from crisis management approaches which create new crises. For that reason, this debate is important because it can and must help us to try to resolve the appalling waste problems facing Naples and Campania. What is urgent is not so much political polemics, but the removal of the waste which creates hazardous conditions for local residents. The government is taking steps to do so, but an effective solution will then need to be found and it will be vital for that solution to be based on European rules. European rules, as the Commissioner has pointed out, are clear, have been consolidated over many years and are confirmed in the new framework directive which we are discussing. When tackling the issue of waste there is a hierarchy, and according to that hierarchy, reduction comes first, followed by separate collection, then re-use and recycling, and disposal only as a last resort, where it is absolutely necessary. Italy is trying too hard to stay within these guidelines and in Naples and Campania the situation has worsened. However, there are problems elsewhere as well, as can be seen from the infringements: too many instances of the authorities sending in special commissioners, too much confusion between the regulations on waste and on energy, leading to unacceptable practices, for instance the practice under which the energy produced from waste has for years been considered in Italy as renewable energy with enormous incentives – EUR 30 billion over ten years, under a measure known as CIP 6 – which have seriously distorted both energy policies and waste policies and have also led to somewhat paradoxical situations where, for instance, there are seven million tonnes of waste fuel pellets in Campania which, even if the incinerator which should dispose of them were to open, could not be burnt in it. Too many derogations from European environmental laws. I cannot say too often that the crisis has brought about new crises. We must now bring the situation into line with the rules, and I truly believe that the government is keen to do so, and those rules are European rules, from assessment of environmental impact to the hierarchy of waste. For that reason, today’s debate cannot be a platform for polemics, but an opportunity for dialogue with the Commissioner to promote such a relationship between Europe and the Member States. I repeat: first the hierarchy, so that jointly agreed rules can be applied in the best possible way.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, flexicurity is nothing new. It is an old Danish model, dating right back to the late 19th century, whereby security not enshrined in contracts of employment is guaranteed by the government, at great cost. What is new in this Europe of ours is terrible insecurity, which affects young people at work but damages society as a whole. In order to combat this insecurity we must change tack and dispense with the laissez-faire
 methods and ideologies which brought it about. It is not true that insecurity creates jobs and economic growth; the opposite is true. Now, with flexicurity, we are experimenting with a new ideology, but one that preserves the old model of insecurity intact. For this reason, my Group has fought for some very practical ideas: against the idea of a labour market rigidity indicator and in favour of a good employment indicator, so as to emphasise that stable, secure employment is the norm; against unjustified dismissal, in that it amounts to discrimination; against a recurring accumulation of atypical contracts, or lifelong insecurity, which is a modern form of slavery; in favour of the right of those not in employment to an income, as they cannot live on air alone; in favour of bringing together different forms of welfare assistance; and against discrimination affecting women at work. The fact that no resources have been earmarked to guarantee flexicurity – there has been a 2% cut – and consequently that no reliable investment is possible, speaks volumes about the risk of this operation turning into nothing but hot air. Workers and young people are calling for something tangible, not for outdated ideologies. These are the points that we have fought for in this House and would like to see voted through.

 Madam President, the text before this House is the result of collective work by the Climate Committee. That committee, set up on ad hoc basis with a mandate of great importance, has undertaken major consultation and discussion initiatives, and has drawn up an instrument which Europe can use to play a major role in the thirteenth Conference of the Parties in Bali. The crux of the policy proposal is clear and forceful. What is needed is a political and multilateral approach which is based on the UN, and takes account of the IPCC and major changes not just in technology but also in the social model. Technology transfers, cooperation and a new environmental and development approach are needed. The proposal of 3.20% by the Commission and the Council is only a starting point in this sense, albeit a positive one. Our thinking needs to be wide-ranging and forward-looking, and frankly the future cannot involve a return to technologies of the past which are old, dangerous and controversial, such as nuclear technology. We also need to start thinking about innovative proposals that we ourselves have put forward in our parliamentary debate and which are now being taken up in a more authoritative way by leading figures such as Chancellor Merkel. I am speaking of the per capita calculation of emissions, which we have proposed, together with Mr Prodi, and which is very important in the light of the current situation in which there now seems to be an inequality in emissions and in which those emissions all have to be reduced in an egalitarian way.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am favourably disposed towards this resolution in that it assists the democratic life of Europe. The Group of the European Left, which is about to hold its second congress, have always said that globalisation, and also this Europe of ours, has seen a coming-together of markets, business interests and red-tape, while democracy has lagged behind. That is all well and good for strong powers, but not for those of us who believe in a different type of society catering for the needs of its weakest members. This was the role of mass parties in the past. Today there is a fresh challenge, namely to establish parties capable of coping with new levels of conflict and decision-making; parties which rebuild democratic participation and a democratic role for Parliament, outside the system of broad coalitions and intergovernmental cooperation that stifles democratic debate. There is of course a need for transparency in the use of funds, but politics cannot be the sole prerogative of the rich.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our discussion here is not about Italy or Romania, it is about Europe and the life of its citizens: a woman was killed, and our thoughts and sympathies must go to her family; Roma and Romanian citizens are disgracefully attacked; our identity, our values, our laws and our history, including tragedies such as the persecution of the Roma people, let this all be called into question today and let us not forget and make sure that there is no room for racism of any sort. These tragedies have taught us the importance of laws that sanction rights: there is no safety without the law. This is how important our laws are, our treaties are, even our economic regulations, which sanction the value and right of mobility and residence, which are the legitimate rights of European citizens, and not concessions, which can be regulated but not denied. European laws are clear: everyone has the right to mobility and residence, with removal only in extreme cases where national security is at stake. Expulsion is strictly individual and never collective, and is accompanied by the guaranteed right to a defence. These are proportional measures that always allow for the continued right of mobility, a right that will never be denied for economic reasons, because poverty cannot be a stigma or a reason to discriminate against citizens. This is what Article 27 of the directive says, it is the law. It is all the more sacred because it concerns rights. The law applies to everyone, not least of all to Commissioners – and I must say Mr Frattini that in your numerous statements here in Parliament, I have had great trouble in finding the spirit and the letter of the law, in fact I cannot seem to find either of these – and to the Member States, who must transpose their membership of Europe and its directives for all of us. There are still too many people dying in Europe today. In Italy, a woman died from a violent attack by a Romanian man. This is extremely distressing to me. Anyone guilty of murder has to pay the price, but that has nothing to do with Roma or Romanian citizens, who have seen some of their own people unfairly attacked. Blame is individual, never collective. So many migrants die trying to get to Europe. These people are overwhelmed and are calling on us to act. This suffering is why we must make Europe a land of the law and of rights, of sacred laws, particularly when we talk about reception. These laws form the basis of security. We want this to be solemnly reaffirmed in Parliament with a vote so that there can be no more misinterpretation of our European laws.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a very important and positive directive. I would like to thank the Commissioner, Mr Dimas, who handled this. I say so myself, as a member of a group that often criticises directives and the Commission: this is not the case here. This directive will be a huge step forward for Europe, both from the point of view of the quality of its policies and its effectiveness. With the completion of the framework directives on the natural elements, the soil will be considered as a key part of the biosphere, a fundamental element of the environmental and climatic balance and not just a platform on which to build. The soil is living, it absorbs CO2
, it produces biomass: it must be safeguarded, it must even be improved, because European soil is particularly polluted. Europe understands this. We had a long and difficult discussion in the Committee, and I would like to thank Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines for being so passionate about the subject. However, there is the risk that Parliament will interfere with the Commission’s text. I never like to see this happen, I always prefer it when Parliament is more advanced than the Commission. Someone has even recommended that the directive should be rejected, but this would be a serious mistake. Europe must look to the future. The soil beneath us is soil that we all share, it is part of our planet. It is the only soil we have and we must look after it.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on this point, according to Mr Cohn-Bendit, the Committee decided by a very clear majority, yet the Chamber has laboured against this decision in a way that borders on obstructionism. This is the truth of the situation. Therefore, it is not a procedural issue, but a question of political attitude.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am in favour of a decisive role for the European Parliament, which is often argued against, but it seems that the governments wish to use this proposal to manipulate our Chamber. This proposal for the composition of seats is, in our view, ill-advised. Italy is being penalised, and that is a cause for concern, but what matters most of all is that the reasons for this penalisation are ill-founded. A historical parity is being destroyed, and, worst of all, the allocation of seats is being altered in the name of a resident population not granted the right of citizenship. Those who, like Italy, have given the right to vote to citizens not resident in the country are being penalised. What we need is something totally different: I think, for instance, that we really need a citizenship of residency, but one that would count not only in terms of the number of Members of Parliament to be elected, but also in terms of the right to vote and to be elected. We need to guarantee representation for political minorities and small states, setting this out expressly in the criteria to be adopted in national electoral laws, and we need to think about new arrangements that make the most of the European parties and their ability to present themselves as such in elections. None of this appears in the report, and for that reason I will be voting against it.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years the approach taken to ‘free’ trade has been completely ideological: the single dogma of laissez-faire globalisation. We now find ourselves struggling with problems such as dangerous products, which is particularly worrying in that toys are involved. Is there a problem with China? Yes! It concerns the guarantee rules that must be complied with. Yet we are thinking about an effective guarantee mark that would be in addition to the CE mark and, for products from outside Europe, even the possibility of a recognition mark, the ‘made in’ mark. There is also a problem, however, with Western multinationals manufacturing products in China or elsewhere, which have major responsibilities for safety and control, including for toys; there is also the problem that products declared to be made in Europe should really be made in Europe. We cannot ask China to respect employment rights and environmental standards, as it must do, while concealing the fact that our multinationals are also responsible for violations of this kind.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this eighth conference on desertification is an extremely important opportunity, in a proper forum such as the UN, but it also requires specific responses to a dramatic situation. Climate change is accelerating processes already under way affecting very fragile areas such as Africa, but not sparing our own continent. Hunger and disease, migrations of biblical proportions and fires are our future, but also our present. We therefore need to make strong, clear choices. The first is, naturally, to implement Kyoto and to sign, at long last, the post-Kyoto agreement, a multilateral agreement providing the frame of reference for a different future. Further choices are also needed so that we can adapt in order to protect lives. There is a real tragedy: its name is water. The right to access to water is already being denied and is likely to be denied more and more for millions of people. For this reason, we should oppose processes to privatise this resource, which is vital for life. Access to water should be guaranteed and it should become a genuine common asset belonging to humanity, including through a solemn declaration by the UN that would subsequently make it possible to put in place public policies to guarantee such a right. It is also necessary for the fight against desertification to guide financial policies on climate. For example, all good practices that allow CO2 capture through agriculture and forestry ought to be promoted and encouraged. This ought also to lead to a review of choices such as those in the common agricultural policy, which have encouraged a decoupling of productive activities carrying with it a risk of desertification and fires. Choices such as intensive production of biomass for energy ought also to be reconsidered. In Europe too, it is also necessary to have a specific, strong policy relating to soil, as for water and air. For this reason we must not erect obstacles, as is being done in this Parliament by a section of the European People’s Party, but instead the framework directive on soil protection put forward by the Commission should be welcomed. It provides that soil should form an integral part of climate policy. Desertification is also caused by a dearth of policy. We must combat it with good policy.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe concerns itself too little with employment problems, and, when it does concern itself with them, it does so totally inadequately, as if employment were not at the heart of building democracy and of the European social model. Certainly, many of the reasons for the problems of Europe lie in this culpable and deliberate undervaluation. Within Europe, job insecurity is very widespread and is hindering social cohesion, constituting a real tragedy – in fact, the major social tragedy being experienced by whole generations of young people, as well as older workers who have been prematurely ejected from the labour market. All this has an effect on our cities, our families, and on all of us. Combating job insecurity is vital when it comes to building a future and to providing certainty and hope. This is our main task. The Commission, instead of combating job insecurity, seems to be adopting it and almost using it to reduce individual and collective rights, to further reduce the role of the trade unions and to set against each other those who have rights – who are in fact becoming increasingly few – and those who do not, in the name of a so-called employment policy. This is unacceptable. What needs to be said is that Europe considers employment to be the basis of true democracy and social cohesion and that Europe has its own concept of what constitutes normal work: stable employment, for an unlimited period, protected by contracts and by the role of the trade unions and with a requirement for equal conditions for standard and non-standard jobs, as part of employment equality. This idea of employment is a healthy idea, which benefits production as well, because it says that competition is not based on exploitation but on quality and innovation. Saving on employment costs and making workers compete against each other garners easy profits in the short term but does nothing to make the economy or society grow. This is the social model that Europe should present to the world, and it should put itself forward as an example. The right to work is a fundamental element of democracy, because it demonstrates the rules for activity upon which society rests. Within these rights we should build a social unit of young and old, instead of placing them in a ridiculous opposition. The employment contract should contain these rules and rights, which cannot be delegated to others or replaced by external action, which would leave the employment contract at the mercy of the law of the jungle. This is why we are not convinced by the concept of flexicurity, of weak contracts replaced by welfare benefits: no, the benefits must be in the contract and they must act as safeguards for the worker, as a European citizen. The text that has been submitted to Parliament is a compromise; it has ambiguous points, but important elements, too. Attacks on this employment, such as those contained in some of the amendments, would be negative and would lead us in a backwards direction. I say this in particular to my socialist comrades, especially with regard to those amendments that distort the nature of normal employment. We would consider the approval of these amendments to be a breach of the compromise agreed on in committee.

My dear Mr Prodi, precisely because I have the same passion as you for Europe, I am convinced that in order to relaunch the constitutional process we need a new impulse of energy based on democracy and rights. I am increasingly convinced that the intergovernmental approach is not the solution to the problems, but is a part of them and is liable to lead us into a mini-Treaty or even a two-speed Europe. It is the citizens and MEPs that must now take the lead, with a new constitutional mandate entrusted to a European Parliament that has these functions, with the aims of a new text and a European referendum; we need to change the text and the context. We need to have, at the centre, clear enforceable rights that define European citizenship. These are the right to work and rights at work that confirm that, for Europe, stable, high-quality jobs are the norm, and not the highly precarious jobs that are being developed with ‘flexicurity’! We need a guaranteed right to the environment, which requires innovative policies, based on cooperation, and multi-faceted visions such as those that should lead to ratification of a post-Kyoto agreement, instead of merely the philosophy of commercial competition. We need a right to peace, born of the rejection of war, and an EU policy actively based on these values and practices, as its own foreign policy. We need a new Europe, the only one possible, which is becoming increasingly necessary. We can build it based on the people, together with the MEPs.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Merkel is sincerely committed to revitalising Europe; however, I do not agree with the method and material with which she seeks to do so. An attempt is being made to lay aside the social, political and democratic crisis and the significance of the French referendum, and to do so by focusing solely on the intergovernmental method, which has even prevented parliaments – including myself, for example – from being privy to the Berlin Declaration, and on continuing with the old liberalist treaty, perhaps eager to create a minimalist version of it. Problems are not solved by continuing down the same path that created them. On the contrary, we must change text and context and focus on democracy and rights, listening once more to the people and to parliaments, beginning with the European Parliament, in order to rewrite a constitution founded on the right to citizenship, peace, work and the environment and then putting it to a European referendum in which the last word lies with the people.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the work done within my committee, for which I was the draftsman, was very careful, and the result was adopted unanimously in committee. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is obviously deeply concerned with protecting the environment but in this specific case we have focused on how the environment can also be protected through the laws of the market. I say this because the key point of the opinion I have presented is precisely this: for those producing, selling or buying organic food it must be clear with the utmost certainty and without any room for error that this food is in fact organic and not, for instance, contaminated by GMOs. I think that it is vital for us to have this ‘zero threshold’ of contamination immediately; it cannot be postponed to later measures. Anyone selling a product – for example, a luxury automobile – cannot tolerate the product containing a single bolt not belonging to that automobile. That is, therefore, the key point of the recommendation made by my committee, which we would like to see included clearly in the final text.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as I have been a shadow rapporteur on this measure, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which has adopted an opinion on it. I attempted to mark out an area for debate that was not just a straight copy of the area that characterised the Bolkestein directive. My group and I were opposed to that directive, since it aimed at commodifying services in general. While remaining opposed, I attempted to define what Europe requires of its social and citizenry services, considering that they should be universal, accessible to all, democratically managed and thus genuinely for the citizens; in other words, they are different from market services, and therefore require a different, separate legal basis. This opinion has the support of the Committee on the Environment and I believe it can also be of use in the context of the debate on the provision in general.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I participated in the Nairobi climate conference, which produced some significant statements and commitments. First and foremost, it has now been decided that Kyoto will continue to exist after 2012. In addition, channels of action have been opened up which go much further than trading in emissions quotas and which, instead, point the way to proactive, positive measures. There will be two funds, one for technological adaptation and the other for renewable and clean energy. Finally, the issues of technology transfer and combating deforestation were discussed. Kofi Annan is right in saying that such approaches require stronger political leadership, and it is Europe that must express this political will, partly through the submission by the individual nations of serious, properly documented plans for reducing emissions, in line with the Kyoto targets and based on substantial progress in energy conservation and renewable sources of energy. The European Parliament could, through its own Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, take on the role of providing encouragement and an impetus in that direction, not least through collaboration with the national parliaments. What is needed is positive direction, which requires active political support and policies focused on cooperation and innovation instead of the purely commercial logic of privatisations and liberalisations, which all too often work in favour of speculative interests and not the public good. Recently, there has been sparring on the nuclear issue: safety is best served by not using nuclear power, but avoiding it and holding back from it on the grounds that it does not benefit our future.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if there is one thing that points to the existence of a European social model, it is precisely services, which must be safeguarded since they represent elements of citizenship. We have been asked to say whether there should be services of general interest befitting all Europeans and, if so, how. In the wake of the Bolkestein Directive, there was some confusion regarding the difference between commercial services and general services. Therefore, we must now clarify what comes under the heading of the market, on the one hand, and of rights, on the other. To do this, in a series of amendments we have taken on board proposals submitted by the ETUC, which maintain that all services of general interest, including economic ones, that is, those for which Europeans pay directly or indirectly – so, nearly all of them – should come within the public, government sphere, and be characterised by their universality, accessibility, collectability and quality. In other words, they should be services and not goods, that is, they should be Europe and not North America. We call on you all to support these amendments, which uphold the trade unions’ position. We also ask you to support them in order to clarify what the aim of a possible framework directive is, that is, to understand what Europe thinks about its social model and what it is proposing to its Member States in relation to services of general interest, whether services of general economic interest or otherwise.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate on emissions trading plays an important yet dangerous part in the issue of the Kyoto agreement. We are highly critical of what may turn into a mere trade in the right to pollute, on top of the harm done to countries suffering from underdevelopment. As we have heard, it is utterly ineffective in actually reducing emissions. We need to be quite clear about this, above all on the eve of a conference of the parties, the thirteenth on climate, which, emblematically, is to take place in Africa, in Nairobi. We should not be setting up a pollution market, but promoting new environmental development based on cooperation policies that should allow the richer countries to produce while polluting much less and the poorer ones to be helped to develop with access to new environmental technologies. This, then, is a substantial difference on which Europe must have a clear position when it takes part in the Nairobi conference: it needs to achieve a good balance between emissions trading and the promotion of truly beneficial cooperation policies.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report, for which I sincerely thank Mr Bowis, can make a significant contribution to a better Europe, one that respects the dignity of psychiatric patients, assists them and helps them back into society, while putting an end to unacceptable practices such as segregation in mental institutions. In short it will be a better Europe, since a civilisation is judged very much on how it behaves in these situations in relation to the weakest individuals and those most at risk. A year ago, a group of people who are commonly termed ‘mad’ came here to Strasbourg from Rome in a coach, together with mental health workers and family members. They had come to talk to us about the situation in Italy: a law named after a psychiatrist, Franco Basaglia, who is unfortunately no longer among us, who fought with them – ‘mad’ men and women – for patient dignity, shut down mental institutions and set up an alternative, local assistance and rehabilitation scheme, because of which people in Italy are now in a better position. These ‘mad’ men and women came to ask us to roll out the scheme in Europe, because they would thus feel more like citizens of this Europe, in which all too often they have been, and still are, discriminated against and deprived of their rights. With this report today, we are beginning to respond to that demand, and we can tell them, ‘You are citizens like everyone else’. But for that to happen completely, this work, which we have done with all our hearts, and the work contained in the Green Paper through positive collaboration between Parliament and the Commission, needs to be turned into something significant that will also provide the various countries with guidance: in other words, a genuine directive for a Europe without mental institutions that restores dignity to all psychiatric patients.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have already said on other occasions that, until we change our liberalist approach, we will struggle to get out of the crisis that Europe is in. It is this approach that is jeopardising the social and environmental objectives, which we are nevertheless trying to achieve. Let us take energy: energy cannot be regarded as a commodity like any other, it is the key issue of the future, which requires us to go down the road of the Kyoto Protocol and far beyond, to switch to renewable sources, by abandoning fossil fuels, and not to run the unacceptable risks of nuclear energy use; it requires fairness and solidarity and not conflicts, trade wars or even, as is sometimes the case, military wars; it requires another vision of the economy, of society, of politics and of democracy. Europe is talking about an energy community, and that is a good idea, but, in order to exist, that community requires the aforesaid choices to be made, and made together with the others – from Russia to South America and to Africa – and not against them. In a few days’ time, the G8 will take place in St Petersburg, and, even though we find the venue very controversial and unacceptable, Europe must present those proposals there, as they go hand in hand with the concept of energy as a common resource of the future.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is worth pointing out that we are talking about real people, who are also listening to us and who therefore require practical responses. A year ago, I took the floor in Parliament to talk about the iron and steel industry and about Terni, an Italian city that was witnessing its own livelihood being threatened by the operations of a multinational. The opinions expressed by this Parliament were very useful. Today, I must come back to this subject by talking about another factory, the Eaton factory, in Piedmont: here, too, the workers are at risk because of the behaviour of a multinational; I should also like to mention Getronix, and others, as we have heard, have talked about Opel. In all of these cases, as in the case of Terni, we can and must help. We must also intervene so as to prevent all of this from happening again, that is to say, to prevent multinationals – which, I might add, garner profits and even enjoy public funds, including European ones – from using Europe by directly pitting one country against another country, workers against other workers. We must decide that dumping and relocations need to be combated with specific rules, because they have nothing to do with competition and the market, but actually undermine social cohesion and burden us all with unbearable costs. In order to combat them, practical responses are required: one of which is to genuinely strengthen European works councils. Granting more powers to workers and trade unions will also help us to build up an idea of what kind of development Europe must have. Some people regard this speculative market as reliable, believing that there might eventually be a positive net outcome in terms of employment, which in fact there is not; I believe that politics must deal with what needs to be produced in this Europe and that we must therefore take action in this field too. I believe that those who want to integrate Europe must recognise that the unity, rather than the division, of European workers is a vital asset when it comes to building this united Europe and that it is therefore not dumping, but the upwards harmonisation of rules and rights, that represents a firm commitment for this Parliament.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is still held back by archaic and dangerous technologies such as nuclear, which it would be good to get rid of, so it would be somewhat strange if it imposed a kind of veto on researching and applying new technologies that may prove fundamental in saving the lives of many people through the use of stem cells. It is not a question of not having an important ethical position on these subjects. In fact I am against human cloning. It is a different thing to try to impose ideological and preconceived viewpoints that compromise not only research and science but above all everyone’s right to their own life. The European Parliament has a right but also a duty to meet these expectations in full. Therefore, a project for Europe is also taking shape around this research programme.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have always said that energy and Europe did not need a laissez-faire approach, but rather valid policies on which a consensus existed. The proof of this is what is happening now: Europe is finding it extremely difficult to develop an innovative energy policy commensurate with the problems raised by the Kyoto Protocol and the needs of a new and different kind of development. The world is experiencing tragic wars for control of oil resources, and this conflict is now moving into Europe: obviously the solution is not protectionism, but instead a fairer use of available energy and the promotion of energy savings and renewable sources. I reiterate our firm opposition to dangerous sources such as nuclear power. We need to introduce economic and social models that are not ‘energivorous’, and emphasise cooperation with other continents; as we can see, this is quite different from becoming involved in trade wars that have nothing to do with our future. To reduce everything to goods and trade is a serious error. Neither laissez-faire nor protectionism, but a diverse and shared energy policy and one of solidarity for Europe and the world – that must be our role.

Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen: water must be a common asset, a right of humankind guaranteed to every woman and man in every continent. We want these binding words to be solemnly approved by this Parliament and to be upheld at the World Water Forum in Mexico City in a few days’ time. They are urgent and necessary words in the face of a tragic reality, whereby billions of people are deprived of the right to water and thus to life, to the extent that millions die and fall ill from the consequences of this deprivation. Wars and conflicts are waged in order to have water, and the very availability of that basic resource is being compromised by the unsatisfactory policies that have reduced it enormously, thus altering its life cycle. There are unquestionably those who want to privatise water and to treat it like a commodity that is only given to people who can pay for it. That is as good as privatising air and only letting people breathe if they have money. Now is the time for some tough decisions that must ensure that Europe is the exponent of equitable policies and is not party to the assault of the multinationals. In Johannesburg, it was not felt that water should be written down as a right, but merely as a need. In Mexico City, at a Conference that we should like the UN, rather than other bodies, to be far more responsible for directly overseeing, this right must be solemnly enshrined: those who are calling for the right to water find themselves denied the right to life, in so many continents, beginning with the African continent. Let us not disappoint them; let us see to it that this Parliament projects a voice of hope and makes a practical commitment.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a huge demonstration today in Strasbourg has told us loud and clear that there is a need for a different Europe. This desire for a different Europe is the opposite of the Bolkestein directive and can find no satisfaction even in the compromise, which comes nowhere near to understanding this need. What it creates, in fact, is a predominant right to profit from services as commodities, so that trade rules and GATS become the basic law, rather than rights and best practices. Who decides what is necessary, proportionate and non-discriminatory? This directive will end up creating a great many legal disputes. That is made worse by the fact that the compromise does not exclude public services and civic services from the scope of the directive, while it is striking that it does exclude the professions and financial and insurance services, namely the powerful sectors. The self-employed are left at the mercy of dumping, and it is easy to imagine what will happen. We want some new ideas, but instead we are offered the old ones again. That is why we shall vote against this directive and this poor compromise.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we support the dock workers against this directive, which is wrong for employment, wrong for their right to safety and wrong for the economy itself, because it proposes competition based on dumping. It must therefore be rejected, as it was in 2003. We need to think about the kind of collapse to which free-market policies are leading. Dock work has a glorious, long-standing tradition, which has created rights and prosperity by linking trading activities with the towns that welcomed them. Without this noble work, which the directive would wipe out for the sake of free-market policies, there would be no future for Europe. The European social model is our chief resource, and this directive, just like the Bolkestein directive, is the negation of it. That is why I believe that the workers are right and that this Parliament should endorse their demands by rejecting the directive before us.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just returned from the Montreal climate conference, where an extremely important result was achieved: the decision to implement the Kyoto commitments to the full and to prepare to go further, by maintaining the agreement well beyond 2012 with very significant targets for reductions. The conference revealed a determination to choose a different development path, focusing on alternative energies and energy savings, and to go down the road of multilateral cooperation, making all that the most important mission for a world caught up in an environmental crisis and the contradictions arising from increasingly marked inequalities. Europe played an important role in the conference regarding this choice of direction, by holding a dialogue with China on its crucial opening-up and sidelining the Bush Administration’s attempt to sabotage the talks. To be frank, there is no significant trace of any of this in the work programme placed before us. President Barroso is proposing free trade and dumping, the Bolkestein directive and the working time directive, and unbridled globalisation leading to increased pollution from transport emissions, which are exceeding all limits. In the current situation of crisis and failure, Mr Blair, together with Mr Barroso, is proposing a bare-bones budget and even nuclear power, in contrast to the Montreal conference and those countries, like China, that are calling for renewables, energy savings and clean alternative sources. I repeat: these free-trade policies have proved to be a failure. Europe needs a new mission, and it is our duty to find one. It needs social cohesion, innovation, environmental quality, a renewed link between the economy and the regions, cooperation, democracy and peace. A different Europe is not just possible but is becoming increasingly necessary.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to speak on this subject, seeing that – as was reported by the delegation from Parliament’s Committee on Petitions, which recently travelled to the Susa Valley in Piedmont, Italy – the valley has been occupied by the military in order to force the members of the community to accept the construction of a 54 km railway tunnel, although they are all against it. These inhabitants fear for the environment and for their health, quite rightly, given the presence of asbestos. They have put forward some serious, valid, well-documented alternative proposals. Rather than listen to them, though, the authorities are resorting to force, as was also demonstrated by the mistreatment suffered by my colleague, Mr Agnoletto. The parliamentary delegation has deemed this situation to be an insult to the population and has declared that an independent inquiry is needed to verify possible violations of European regulations, which would be even less acceptable in the case of a project that was supposed to be a Community project. I believe that the European Parliament should take on board the proposals of the delegation from the Committee on Petitions, since it is only fair that the Susa Valley benefit from an Olympic truce as well.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the greenhouse effect is the greatest problem that we have to face, because it involves a structural change in the conditions needed for life. Our ability to address this problem has to be an essential element in what we do. To that end, we must accept the Kyoto strategy and its implementation as overriding factors in all our decisions, as a legal basis and a basis for planning, and as a key factor in Europe’s internal and international policies from Montreal onwards. The main thrusts of the Kyoto Protocol, namely convergence and contraction, show that our development and economic models need to change radically and to be geared towards a fairer, more rational way of managing resources. I think we can achieve a figure of one tonne-of-oil equivalent per person. Such a commitment should encourage us to save energy and to use alternative, renewable, democratically managed sources. Any idea of resorting to nuclear energy – which is a finite and extremely hazardous source that entails unsolvable problems such as nuclear waste, and is not democratic – to meet this target and this need would be utterly unacceptable.

Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, at the start of the parliamentary term I said in this House that this Parliament resulted from elections in which all the government parties were defeated – starting with your country, Mr Barroso, Portugal. That was the sign of an economic and social crisis that was also related to European policies, that is to say free-trade policies. We needed decisive action but did not get it – not even after the referendum results in France and the Netherlands rejecting the Constitutional Treaty. In fact there was a temptation to ignore the people, instead of changing the policy. We then had the presidency of Mr Blair, who presents himself as the answer to Europe’s problems when it is clear that he is an integral part of these problems. Indeed, his presidency is coming to an end and we have not even reached agreement on the budget. This is a failure for which you, Mr Barroso, must carry equal responsibility with Mr Blair, in that you and your Commission have gone along with all the stages of the crisis as it unfolded and indeed have ended up by making things worse. What can we say about your most recent proposals, when you spoke to us about a simplification that in fact would mean not doing the good things, such as the REACH directive, but instead doing the bad things, such as the Bolkestein directive? The point is that the free-trade route is taking Europe down a blind alley. The problem is exemplified not by Europe or by enlargement or by Turkey, but by free trade; and today you have once again suggested that we go down this blind alley. Instead we need something quite different. We need to draw up a plan to revive qualified development and a form of social cohesion that would be capable of reinstating the European social model as an alternative to the North American model, not as a poor copy of it. To do this we need a sounder budget that is not pared down to the bone, and a package of regulations that would promote upward harmonisation and not the social ‘dumping’ of the Bolkestein directive. We need cooperation within Europe and with other countries to relaunch qualified development, not senseless competition or the ruinous dictatorship of the World Trade Organisation. We must give priority to innovation and the environment, not to the absurd and disastrous revival of nuclear energy. We need communication networks that promote respect for the environment and do not connive at its destruction. We need to give citizenship to immigrants and ensure that there is no repetition of the episodes we have seen in Lampedusa and Melilla. We must guarantee democracy and not the so-called security packages that adversely affect democratic rights and have furthermore been rejected by the UK Parliament. We must choose peace, not war. We should give preference to a democratic Parliament, not just one more bureaucratic authority. Finally we need governments of the Left which look to change and not to large, unacceptable coalitions. We propose an alternative European Left, more and more closely linked to a European society that wants change.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forces opposing REACH demonstrate a sheer obstinacy that can be defined as anti-European. They are the forces of the uncontrolled market, of deregulation and of profits that speculate with public health and the environment. All these forces represent negative values that go against the underlying principles of a Europe harmonised in respect of social and environmental issues. Frankly, we do not have a high regard for Mr Barroso’s conduct. We think that a firm and decisive response to these forces is called for. For this reason we did not share, and we strongly criticise, the bad compromises that have been reached: they run the risk of gravely weakening REACH, without even resisting the forces that would like to kill it off. We are therefore – with the consent, in my view, of the vast majority who at this time are trying to ensure that this Parliament passes the best laws possible – retabling all the texts that are necessary for a strong REACH regulation, that is to say one that will be of genuine service to a modern Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate of ours today on the oil problem means talking of the difficulties of our current situation – from wars to the exhaustion of non-renewable resources and to environmental damage – and deciding whether we shall have a different future or whether we shall have any future at all. The oil crisis is not due to short-term economic factors, as is now obvious; it is linked to the fact that the current social and geopolitical set-up and development models are defunct. Finding a way out of it requires fairness, redistribution of wealth, new development paradigms, and new energy policies based on efficiency and on clean, safe, renewable alternatives, the opposite of coal and nuclear. Peace, fairness and the environment are the only options that can take us into the future. We must make them happen by means of practical policies that are not left to the market but are developed through new political choices and new action in the public sphere.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, safety is an integral part of the right to mobility that we are called upon to guarantee. That is why we have always spoken out against the free-market policies that in recent years have increasingly reduced transport to being a mere product. The effects of those policies on safety and on the right to mobility itself must be made perfectly clear and, in our opinion, they should be seen as detrimental and a cause for concern. Changing direction means placing rights, and not just profits, at the heart of the strategy. What we need are rules, controls and investment. The role of transport sector workers is fundamental in this, and it may prove decisive in ensuring that adequate standards are met. Good trade union relations are essential, not only to ensure respect for workers’ rights but also to safeguard all our citizens. In this context, I must report a serious situation to this House: the discrimination that the largest trade union representing flight attendants is experiencing in Italy, as the board of Alitalia is denying its right to take part in negotiations. This is even more serious since it involves a company like Alitalia, which for us has a strategic importance that we want to promote. There is a basic rule that needs to be stated: only ‘good’ work will produce ‘good’, safe transport.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you, Mr Blair, are not the solution to Europe’s problems; in fact you are one of the problems. You are not a new problem, but an old problem. The problems of Europe are its inability to work towards achieving peace, and, let us not forget, you went to war in Iraq alongside George Bush. They are democratic, political, economic and social crises precisely due to the liberalist, monetarist and technocratic policies that you advocate, passing off old ideas as new. You talk about political Europe, but in fact you entrust it all to the market, because for you, politics, the economy and the market are one and the same thing. In fact, whilst you understand that this liberalist Constitutional Treaty is dead, the cure that you propose to us is completely inappropriate, in terms of liberal reforms, starting with the one on services and the labour market: this cure of yours does not even enjoy good health in your own country, as we witnessed with the elections. No! The solution to Europe’s problems is something else entirely, and it is precisely 
to be found in this left-wing, mass Europeanism that has consciously emerged among citizens who have read and understood and expressed themselves by means of the vote in France and the Netherlands. They were not protesting against either Turkey or enlargement, but explicitly against liberalism. They call for a tangible and formal Constitution for a new peaceful, democratic and social Europe, and can find broad agreement on that with the many citizens who expressed a critical ‘yes’ vote. That is our Europe and this Parliament has a major responsibility that it cannot and must not avoid. It is not a matter of chasing after new supposed leaders, but of being a thoroughly new Parliament. This crisis is not a crisis of calculations and of egoisms, or of the computer against the country folk, but we cannot forget how ‘mad cow’ disease started. It is that too, but it is above all the unquestionable crisis of a liberalist idea: not to formulate an alternative idea of Europe would truly be unforgivable.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 19 March there was an enormous demonstration in Brussels by trade unions and the peace movement against the Bolkestein directive, against free trade and war, and for a social Europe. Faced with the paradoxical situation in which we find ourselves, characterised by a strong currency, a weak economy and a society in crisis, faced with the crisis of the Maastricht framework and the Lisbon Strategy, in our view this demonstration – which brought together tens of thousands of workers from the whole of Europe, and I stress the whole of it, including the new countries in the east – put out a clear call for a much-needed change of direction. They did so despite the idea that some have of a two-tier Europe, that is to say one of internal dumping, the Europe of the Bolkestein directive. The demonstration showed instead that there is a need for a harmonisation of rights, levelled upwards, of course. What is needed, then, is a Europe that rejects the Bolkestein directive – that ominous directive on working hours – and, from the left, is able to break down the cage of monetarist free trade and to revitalise – not reduce – quality investments, rights, development, work and environment: in other words, one that is able to turn itself into a social Europe, the only possible kind. We want to try to put these aspirations into practice in this House through our proposals and help to bring into Parliament the strength of feeling that enlivened the streets of Brussels, to which this Parliament cannot fail to respond.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel, quite frankly, that the debate in this Chamber is rather paradoxical, since we are taking a fragmented approach to issues such as the Lisbon Strategy, the Financial Perspectives, the forthcoming European Council and the possible ways to reform the Stability and Growth Pact. The last, by the way, is an issue on which everyone except Parliament is taking action. I believe, instead, that these aspects should all be dealt with together. Indeed, social cohesion and growth in the number and quality of jobs have certainly not been facilitated by laissez-faire
 policies focusing on competitiveness, nor by monetarist policies. These have even been enshrined in the new Constitutional Treaty, the only case in history where a constitution includes a monetary treaty. We are confronted by the paradox of a Europe with a very strong currency but a weak economy in a deepening crisis and a society in great difficulty. There is a growing number of factors that are likely to make the situation even worse, such as those implicit in the Bolkestein directive, in the European budget cuts and in the false flexibility of the Stability Pact, which some would like to see used only to downgrade pensions. That has all led to a Europe of social fragmentation, relocations and the inevitable decline in its social and cultural model. We have to set off along a new path, one that breaks with laissez-faire
 economics and monetarism, is based on an upward harmonisation of rights and wage levels and provides new impetus for quality development. To achieve that, it is necessary on the left to break out of the Stability Pact straitjacket so as to invest within individual countries – but also directly as the European Union – in research, innovation and whatever else is needed to promote development. What we need, therefore, is a different Europe, a social Europe, the kind of Europe that we shall be demanding at the European demonstration in Brussels on 19 March.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are only a few of us here in the Chamber at the moment, although in fact a great many people are listening to us in a state of anxiety and distress. Yesterday, a small delegation from that working community came to Strasbourg at their own expense. Indeed, although we may be discussing Terni, a small town in Italy, we are actually debating the future of the whole of Europe. For those who are not familiar with it, Terni is a town in the green countryside of Umbria that is different from the others. Located in the region of Lake Trasimeno, with its little medieval towns and the mysticism of Saint Francis and the renaissance painters, Terni has, for 120 years, been a town of steel and steelworkers. Its lifeblood is the steelworks and, through innovation, it has been able to protect and to improve its production for over a century, even during the war. There are no valid economic reasons why the production of magnetic sheet steel should be concentrated in France and Germany: in 2004 ThyssenKrupp made a net profit of many millions of euros from the Terni plant. Only a few months ago, in June, the company signed an agreement with the social partners, witnessed by the Italian Government, to revitalise production at the Terni plant, and the European Parliament voted to support the agreement. Now the owners of the company seem to want to tear up those agreements by announcing today that 600 workers will be made redundant as of tomorrow, after having already got rid of the 370 workers in the magnetic steel sector. The letter the company sent to us Members of the European Parliament is therefore belied by the facts, as well as by the contradictions in the letter itself, and it has further convinced me that we must vote for the unified resolution that we have tabled both for substantive reasons and for the sake of democracy. The situation is even more tragic and unacceptable when one thinks of the dignity of those European citizens and their families who have been protesting for more than a year, and of the rules for social dialogue in Europe, for which all the Community institutions have pleaded so hard, especially the Commission. We are expecting the Commission to give this Chamber some concrete answers, which so far have not been forthcoming. If signed and sealed agreements are ignored and an already submitted investment plan is loudly denied, it is a serious matter for the whole of Europe, because it would give rise to a European Union dominated by uncontrolled relocations, industrial dismissals and speculative thinking, which would inevitably drag it into decline and crisis. Intervening in the Terni case therefore means intervening for the future of each one of us and performing a duty that upholds the genuine interests of a Europe of work and development. Furthermore, if all other approaches are constantly blocked, it would be appropriate to resort to public intervention to guarantee the future that would otherwise be denied.

 Mr President, even the recent tsunami disaster shows us how fundamental our relationship with nature is for ensuring the survival of human life and civilisation. Climate change is threatening precisely that, and therefore a drastic reduction in CO2 emissions has become an absolute priority and a factor that ought to underpin every decision on economic and social issues. Europe has committed itself to the Kyoto commitments and to post-Kyoto, and that puts the spotlight even more strongly on the serious responsibility of the US Administration, which, however, is opposed even to ratifying Kyoto or to addressing the post-Kyoto period, as was supposed to have happened in Buenos Aires. Even Europe, I have to admit, is still a long way from playing its part to the full: it has allowed Kyoto to become distorted with the introduction of emissions trading and, above all, it is still a long way from putting its target emissions cuts into actual practice. In fact, emissions are still increasing and in some countries, such as Italy, they are increasing considerably. We have to think about why that is happening. The fact is that it has been left up to mere market mechanisms to achieve the Kyoto targets. So far, they have not worked, while free-market globalisation has led to a multiplicity of distorting factors: production moved to countries where environmental legislation is weaker, thus increasing emissions; rich countries wasting more energy on transport and domestic uses; and the privatisation and liberalisation of the energy sector which, instead of producing savings and clean energy sources, has led to competition among traditional, polluting sources. If – as we must – we want to implement Kyoto in practice and to go beyond it, we need to take a very different approach: we must channel all our efforts, in terms of scientific research, energy policy and infrastructure, into achieving that objective through a major strategic plan that is properly structured, adequately funded and based on democratic participation. We need something that goes far beyond the old, obsolete market formulae and which instead represents the real challenge of a sustainable future: a new social and environmental economy, with a structure based on democratic principles and solidarity with the whole world. All that becomes even more obvious and inescapable when we think that Kyoto is just the first tiny step. In Buenos Aires, the US Administration prevented anyone from talking about what in fact needs to be done about the post-Kyoto period: that is to say, about a necessary, epoch-making change. I have to admit that the Italian Government allied itself with that reactionary stance. That, then, is the real mission awaiting a different Europe, one that is able to talk to the whole world along these lines and, above all, to take concrete action to create a different set-up from the one in which we are unfortunately living.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on other occasions I have already indicated that we should realise that a certain approach to the European project has now reached a very difficult social and political crisis point. While the updating of the Lisbon strategy is being debated, however, concrete choices are being made which can indicate a move in a particular direction. On this point, I would like to mention two actual examples. The first example is a proposal for a directive, the so-called Bolkestein directive, which in our opinion ought to be rejected. It is an outright collection of negative contents mixed up together, which would lead to an outright jungle where the fundamental rights of workers and citizens to high-quality services would be simultaneously violated, and it is therefore quite rightly opposed by the trade unions and by a wide range of social partners; we call for its withdrawal. The second example is the proposal for the REACH regulation, designed to reform our chemical industry in terms of quality and health and safety, and we strongly call for it to be adopted speedily. These are two concrete choices which demonstrate two different conceptions of Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our friendly relations with Cuba are longstanding and ongoing. You see, Cuba is an example of a small island attempting to determine its own existence, and to do so in a way that is different compared with the great imperial power. We look on this with solidarity. Naturally, we are also able to express our criticisms, explicitly and without restraint, as we have done and continue to do, as regards the death penalty and certain judicial procedures, for example. However, we consider it mistaken, unjust and unacceptable that punitive measures should be taken against Cuba. For decades, Cuba has suffered from a ferocious economic blockade imposed by the US administration. Frankly, there is no reason why Europe should align itself with such measures. On the contrary, it is precisely relations, trade and engagement that can foster understanding and improvements. In Latin America important and historic events are taking place, as witnessed by the victory of progressive forces in countries such as Brazil, Venezuela and Uruguay. By comparison with the logic of laissez-faire globalisation and war – and today we have seen some terrible images – the need for an alternative politics is emerging: Cuba is part of this Latin America. The relationship with Europe helps this Latin America, and the relationship with Latin America helps Europe. We call for the abolition of all measures discriminating against Cuba and, consequently, of the Council’s common position; a similar demand must be addressed to the US Government. At the same time, we call for a strengthening of free and fruitful relations.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since you first stood before this House, our reasons for voting against you have increased. We have already told you what these reasons are: they are called war, which you have supported, and laissez-faire
 policies, of which you are a prime representative. It is no coincidence that today we are adding another reason: democracy. You cannot say that you want to cooperate with Parliament and start by not respecting its vote. You cannot say that people are experiencing a crisis in democracy and set that kind of example. Our vote against you and your Commission is therefore a vote in favour of peace, social Europe, democracy and also a new maturity for this Parliament of ours. If you and your Commission are defeated, Parliament and democracy will be the winners, and the people will have more confidence in Europe. (Applause)

Mr President, you know how over all these years we have kept up a constant and also radical criticism of the way in which this Europe of ours is being forged. I say ‘ours’ because we are pro-Europe, like you. For this reason, rather than just reiterating our criticisms, which are harsh, of the way in which your Commission has acted – criticism of which you are already aware – I will put to you a question on which we can reflect together: where does the European project stand in relation to laissez-faire
 globalisation? Can we cherish the fond illusion of the excellence of a gradualistic process subordinate to this globalisation, without realising that globalisation is consuming the rights which matured in the welfare states of the twentieth century and is creating new global dynamics of injustice and disenfranchisement? We are, in fact, seeing the return of war, spiralling terrorism, and workers being set against one another – attempts to do this are happening right now in the car industry. In this picture, where is Europe? Is not its very Constitution a step backwards when compared with a constitution like Italy’s, which is founded on work and the repudiation of war; is it not almost an acquiescence to the dictates of laissez-faire
 globalisation? That is why for us Europe can hold out hopes for a different future only if it can be a real alternative, in contrast to what it has been up until now.

 Madam President, the reasons why we shall be voting against the candidature of Mr Barroso are very simple. We find ourselves in a rather paradoxical situation. We have just had elections in which practically all the governments were defeated, not because the citizens did not understand or were not informed, but because there was mass protest at decisions such as those on the war, some of which Europe made itself and some of which it did not oppose. What we have here is a protest at liberalist policies, deep social malaise and a social, economic and environmental crisis, all due to the failure of these liberalist policies, starting with the Stability Pact and the privatisations. A certain approach to European integration is in crisis, and rhetoric is not enough to resolve this crisis. In view of this, there is swing to the right, to conservatism, and an attempt to propose a philosophy of compromise in the name of so-called governability, which means taking a position between bureaucracy and governments without facing up to the problems. We, however, take the opposite view, that Europe needs a change inspired by the movements demanding rejection of the war, social policies, democracy and citizenship through residence. Frankly, these are all things that Mr Barroso does not represent.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that today’s debate and the vote that will follow represent an important stage for Community policy on agriculture. I believe that there is a need, because of what has happened in recent years, and chiefly in the last two years, for an even stronger common agricultural policy (CAP) in Europe. Instead, through this lengthy work and the work that Mr Capoulas Santos has carried out, we have tackled some issues, but we have done so within an old system. The issues that have become central over these last two years are, for Europe, the following two issues, which I would like to stress. We started with the health check on the CAP, carried out in 2003. Some data should give us pause to reflect whether we are on the right road in our work, even though excellent work has been done over this year and a half. We are losing a huge number of jobs in employment, approximately – 
from Eurostat data up until 2005, so we do not know what has happened in 2007 and 2008 –
 two million employees, whom we have lost in this stable, seasonal and familiar employment sector. The number of holdings that we lost between 2003 and 2005 –
 again according to Eurostat data – 
is 611 000. At a time like this, of economic crisis, it happens that the Member States intervene strongly with the banks and industry, but in no country is a debate going on about the state of agriculture, because everything is expected to be achieved by Community policy and the CAP. Through the action we are taking, I believe that we are going against the real needs of farmers and the action that they in fact require: namely, to help these businesses to emerge from a situation of subordination to processing and marketing, because the other fact – 
and I am just finishing – 
is that the agricultural companies have lost income share over the last two or three years, to the benefit of the transformation of the marketing industry. These were the issues that we ought to have tackled, and on this point the assessment is very negative with regard to what we will be voting on in the Chamber the day after tomorrow.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would say to Mr Castiglione that - as the Minister, Mr De Castro, has said - the proposal having emerged from the committee responsible and now before Parliament is worse than the one originally put forward by the Commissioner. We are talking here about millions of individuals who are dedicated to a product which has made Europe great on account of its quality and links with the land. The first point I should like to make concerns grubbing-up. We are told that the area affected will fall to between 175 000 and 200 000 hectares. My first question is this: who will grub up the vines and who will take over this grubbed-up land, and what is wrong with proposing that the funds be used - and perhaps even reduced rather than increased - with a view to restructuring these vineyards so as to improve quality? I would ask Parliament the following: why must we expel dozens or even hundreds of workers and farmers in order to make way for large multinationals, as is happening in Sicily, Mr Castiglione? The point, then, is this: why use European funds for grubbing-up, rather than using them to improve quality and for business restructuring? We have adopted so many measures in this House and in Community policies over recent years! My second point relates to the free market in the rights of areas under vines. Why should the market be liberalised for the whole of Europe? What is the sense in buying a hectare under vines in Sicily, Campania, Greece or elsewhere and transferring it to another area? That hectare under vines is linked to a given quality and production, a typical product, an ecotype established in that area. Why make this sort of proposal? Are we seeking here, too, to encourage the large-scale buy-outs which are occurring in some parts of the Mediterranean? This is the key point, and it is why we believe that the Commission's proposal was better. The proposal emerging from Parliament is worse than the one advocated by the Commission, if what we want is a reform that improves quality and keeps farmers and other workers on the land. That is why we shall vote against a reform of this kind.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is important to initiate this discussion, although, partly because of what the Commissioner has told us, we are not seeing the full scale of the problem yet. I would like to remind the Commissioner that a few months ago, we asked for a moratorium on the discussion of amendments to the CMO in fruit and vegetables in order to pause and reflect on what was happening – and what is happening now in wine – based on a few points, which I would now like to raise. Firstly: we are talking about harvests that have failed due to climatic events, but there is no mention of the fact that we will be dealing with this problem for years, because climate change is happening in Europe and around the world. Fact one! Secondly: compared to 1950, when there were 2.5 billion of us and everyone on the planet had 0.5 hectares each, by 2020 the world’s population will have grown to 7.5 billion (according to UN data) with around 0.2 hectares per inhabitant available for cultivation. I understand where Mr Baringdorf is coming from when he says that this is a fundamental problem, but I do not think that the increases we are seeing at this time are to the advantage of producers. If we look at the difference between the cost of the product and what consumers are charged, we can see that consumers and producers are paying for a very long supply chain. However, this is partly due to policies created here in the European Parliament, so I think the Commissioner should look carefully at the actions we are going to be setting out. Of course, it has been important to return fallow land to production, although today what we need most of all is in-depth discussion. When the European Community was created, action was taken to meet the food requirements of the European people. Today, we should adopt the same policy. We can no longer allow land to be set aside under a decoupling policy, because this leads to a loss of production and renders our questions unproductive. Therefore, we must prepare for an in-depth discussion on whether the policies of the past few years have delivered a response to consumers and producers, or whether conversely they have created problems for both.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Parliament ought to see this as a new element, one which opens up a new period of reflection and a new debate on agricultural production in Europe. The point is not only that we have had a change in climate and that in some rural areas we have had production difficulties. The issue is that the entire system of agricultural production in this sphere is changing because, and there were some references to this in the previous debate, today many crops are being produced using different production systems, as we have heard. The point is that we should now review the policy implemented for agricultural production in recent years by the European Community. It is not only grains that are the issue, but in a few months’ time we will also have to tackle the problems of meat production and dairy production, because there are already changes in production and drops in production in this field. I therefore believe that the Commissioner and the Commission ought to have a careful period of reflection and enable Parliament to give a definitive response to these problems, to avoid the current situation: a rise in food costs that is causing problems for many families in Europe and elsewhere.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I in turn must especially thank the Commissioner and the rapporteur of the report that we are about to examine in this Chamber, but my group is unlikely to vote for it because of two points that I should like to highlight. The first is that this reform, which is so important for a sector that employs thousands, if not millions, of workers in both agriculture and processing, may change the landscape completely once we have directives on climate change. If it is true that Europe is rightly starting to expand alternative forms of production – biodiesel, biofuels, and the production of mass and biomass from wood – then it means that several million hectares will be taken out of agricultural and food production for human and animal consumption. That is already happening in large countries like China: it was in the news a few days ago. The second point is the fact that the reform in question does not address one of the problems raised in this Chamber, which is that in recent years the profit from agricultural production has all gone to commercial businesses and large multinationals. According to some statistics, between 60% and 70% of agricultural profit is kept by the distribution chain. The reform we are examining does not address this problem. Those are the basic reasons that we want to raise, and we are therefore unlikely to vote for the report in this Chamber tomorrow.
 Vincenzo Aita,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the provision under examination can be significantly improved by Parliament during tomorrow’s vote in the Chamber. In fact, a provision such as this one, which lays down a threshold of contamination of 0.9% for organic products, namely a threshold equal to that for conventional products, is of no help either to organic producers or, particularly, to consumers. Even the figures provided to us by the Commissioner show that this is a provision that could cause significant damage to the organic sector. In fact, laying down the same threshold for conventional products and for organic products would create confusion for consumers, who might no longer choose organic products, and this would also be detrimental for the agricultural production system, which in recent years has grown considerably in this sector. I therefore believe that Parliament should return to the zero tolerance threshold in order to make these products even more attractive, ensuring that they are consumed in increasing quantities and providing ever more protection for consumers. An organic product where a 0.9% threshold is allowed makes no sense and, equally, consumers would see no point in buying and spending more money on a product which no longer gives them the necessary guarantees and is not free of pollutants.
 Vincenzo Aita (GUE/NGL

 – (IT) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the figures speak for themselves: in recent years Europe has seen its production decrease, while other countries outside Europe are witnessing a constant increase in their production shares. Today, in launching a reform of the CMO in wine, Europe must take account of the fact that approximately 3 400 000 hectares and 3 000 000 workers are involved. Looking to grubbing-up as a tool for market balance means going along the route of previous changes to the CMOs in tobacco and sugar. We cannot continue along this path, which results in falls in employment levels and the abandonment of entire agricultural territories, often located in fragile areas from the viewpoint of hydrogeological capacity. Any reform must thus take account, above all, of businesses, workers and environmental conditions, and it is only by protecting and maintaining a European agricultural system of production that we will be able to ensure quality and security for consumers. Of course, the efforts made by the rapporteur, Mrs Batzeli, have brought about an improvement with respect to the Commissioner’s positions. Despite this, I believe that there are still points of concern. Above all, we must abandon the grubbing-up scenario and use the crop reconversion levy for those holdings with market difficulties, to achieve high-quality production. As the latest European export data show, we need to place the accent on quality and, as a result, production that should identify itself with the land and with our traditions. This is the road that we need to go down, not that of changing wine into an ordinary industrial product. It follows from this that we should not add sugar as a way of enriching wine, and that we need to lay down precise rules on vinification. On this point, the use of musts of European origin for enrichment should not be penalised, since this is a traditional practice in European winemaking and is not detrimental to the quality of the wine itself. For this reason, it is important to retain support for funding musts. In the final analysis, it is essential for any reform to take into account the climate changes currently occurring, which will have dramatic consequences in some areas in southern Europe, throwing their agricultural systems into confusion. Now is the time for Europe to defend its land, its civilisation and its traditions.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the points made in Mr Guerreiro's report have the merit of being a positive response to the demands made in recent years by fishing operators, and therefore they should clearly be taken on board in the Commission’s decision. The report comes out strongly in defence of employment levels in this sector, which comprises 90 000 vessels and employs some 190 000 workers in Europe. Previous fisheries directives led to considerable job losses, with the result that Europe now imports 40% of its needs. Over the last 10 years, 35% of jobs and 20% of vessels have been lost, in an industry concentrated above all in regions with a weak and particularly fragile economy. One of the most important points in the report that I should like to highlight is its appeal to the Commission to guarantee and support the operation and adoption of measures to remedy the high instability of fuel prices, both by creating a guarantee fund for the sector with Community participation, and by implementing the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance in order to reduce operating costs to a minimum. The period for rescue aid must be extended to 12 months, and the ceiling raised from EUR 30 000 to EUR 100 000. The European Fisheries Fund must continue to grant aid for the renewal and modernisation of the fleet, in particular to allow the replacement of engines, so as to guarantee crew safety and environmental protection. The role of research in this area must not be forgotten either. Research needs to be performed and developed to enhance energy efficiency, reduce costs and ensure protection for fish stocks and fishing systems. If we just bear those points in mind, we can help those parts of the weakest regions in the European economic system that have close links with fishing to protect their jobs and to continue supplying Europe’s consumers.

 Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, it really seems as though the thousands of deaths already caused by asbestos, and the tens of thousands of people at risk of dying in the coming years due to progressive exposure to asbestos – the latency period, we know, can be up to 15 or even 20 years – count for nothing at all. It seems as though the Eternit trial, which began in Turin concerning the events at Casale Monferrato, where there is not one family that has not suffered a loss, counts for nothing. Asbestos should have been banned operationally by the Member States applying the 1999 directive. The States should have taken every possible precaution to protect exposed workers, by applying the 2003 directive, closing factories, neutralising contaminated sites and compensating the victims and local people. This has not happened everywhere. Little or nothing has been done. I have already mentioned the trial in Turin, where Swiss and Belgian owners are accused. Everyone knew about it, but little was done, and above all the industry shirked its responsibilities, working within the loopholes created by the inertia of the public authorities. This inertia can be seen in the events in Italy, in Brioni, where asbestos has not been removed, in Porto Marghera and in Cengio, where deaths are still occurring. Today the industry is asking the Commission to accept another exemption from the 2006 REACH regulation, already granted for a limited period, for chrysotile asbestos fibres. It is true, low-voltage electrolysis plants do represent a limited application, and there are only a few such plants, but where industrialists claim it is impossible to use any alternative then the plants should be closed. This may be blackmail, but alternatives to this process have been found in Sweden, using asbestos-free membrane technology as replacements, at low voltage, and a similar solution has also been adopted for the production of hydrogen. Why ‘yes’ in some States and ‘no’ in others? Because in the long battle to ban PCBs there have been countless omissions and stalling techniques, supported even by the European Commission Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry. In this case, too, a good example has not been set. The 1999 directive banning asbestos stipulated that the review of this authorisation should be preceded by an opinion from the scientific committee on toxicology, which was never produced. Is this how the Commission respects directives? Not to mention the trade unions, who say they were never even consulted. The European Parliament is doing its bit to compensate for the failings of others. This resolution calls on the Commission to bridge, by 2009, a legislative gap on the prohibition of second-hand products containing asbestos; roof pieces, aeroplane parts and whatever else should be disposed of once and for all. Yet again, precise dates are being set for a strategy to ban all types of asbestos by 2015, but these objectives were already set in 1999. Ten years have gone by and the deaths have continued. Among the first initiatives of this parliamentary term, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left called for the establishment of a Community fund to compensate victims and for ad hoc funds for decontamination. This was a specific request to the Commission, which today is instead bowing to the will of the multinationals. We need to move on, however, to practical action and commitments. Only when these are in place, starting with the demands of this resolution, can we be more understanding. Today that willingness is not evident, and so we will vote against granting this exemption.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President, first of all I would like to greet the president of the DTP Party, Mr Ahmet Türk, who is a VIP guest here to follow the debate. Dear Ahmet, you know that we are with you, that we support the democratic struggle your party is conducting in Turkey for the recognition of the fundamental rights of the Kurdish people. We acknowledge that the DTP is an essential tool for fostering democracy in Turkey, and for this reason we firmly condemn the police operations that Prime Minister Erdoğan has ordered against you, imprisoning all three vice presidents of the DTP together with more than 300 militants and sympathisers. The DTP’s victory in the last administrative elections shows that the DTP is a party that enjoys strong popular democratic support. The European Parliament resolved to ask Prime Minister Erdoğan to table direct discussions with the DTP and instead his response was more oppression, more police, more authoritarianism and more imprisonment. Everybody knows that my parliamentary group and the European Left have up to now supported Turkey’s application for membership of the European Union, at the same time supporting the process of reform in that country. I believe, however, that over the last two years, and particularly during the last few months, Mr Erdoğan has showed his other side, that of a leader who is hand in glove with the worst part of the Turkish army that simply wishes to massacre the Kurds. The process of reform is practically dead in the water, the prisons are filling with Kurds; Mr Erdoğan himself is cutting off any prospect of Turkey’s membership. The responsibility for what is happening in Euro-Turkish relations and the growing bewilderment of European public opinion with regard to Turkey lies with him and him alone. I would like to send a very strong political message to Mr Erdoğan: either seek a negotiated political solution to the Kurdish question which, let us be very clear about this, is a process that will involve direct negotiations with the DTP, or we will ask you to suspend your negotiations for membership of the European Union. The road to Turkey’s membership of the Union is via Diyarkabir and the DTP, otherwise it will be us, in other words the people who most supported your accession process, who ask for a pause for reflection, which could well become permanent.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about what has happened at Fiat in Brussels. With the sole aim of undermining the trade union, Fiat has falsely accused its workers of having taken its managers hostage – an event that in fact never took place. There was no kidnapping, either on 9 April or ever. The rumour has been deliberately spread by Fiat in an attempt to discredit the workers, who are trying to protect their future in the face of 24 lay-offs. Fiat is refusing to have any meetings, discussions or negotiations with the trade unions representatives. The sole aim is to lay off 24 workers, 12 of whom are trade unions representatives. I think it would be a good idea for Parliament to discuss not only this fact, but also the anti-union conduct by Fiat and a very large number of major European multinationals, which is devoid of respect for workers’ rights. While these multinationals benefit from national and European Union rules and, in several cases, also subsidies, they do not respect workers’ rights.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened carefully to the Commissioner’s statement. It is true, there have been several advances made, but yet again I must remind you, Commissioner, that the democratic clause, approved by Parliament three years ago now, has not yet been applied in trade agreements with all countries, as requested by Parliament. Double standards are still used – tough with the weak and deferential with the strong, depending on what is most convenient for Europe in these trade agreements, but this double standard is also used in other situations. I refer to a subject that has already been touched on: I find the position taken by the Vatican State against the proposal to decriminalise homosexuality shameful and unacceptable. It is unacceptable that the European institutions should launch appeals almost every month against those states that continue to persecute people whose only crime is to be homosexual and yet for there to be silence when such a serious and prejudicial position on human rights is assumed by the Vatican and its representative at the UN. This is a position that runs counter to the universal declaration of human rights, the 60th 
anniversary of which we are celebrating this year. The Vatican’s statement goes against the fundamental point, which is that human rights are indivisible, universal and must be protected regardless of sexual orientation, race, skin colour, and so on. I have asked the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights to call the Vatican State’s representative to the EU to attend one of the subcommittee’s meetings in order to answer for this behaviour and to discuss it with them. That is what we routinely do with all states that have diplomatic representation in the European Union. I would also like to make it clear that the attempt to backtrack by merely saying that France had not yet submitted the document was a real blunder because it does not change the facts: the Vatican State has not backed down on the serious statements it has issued.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been working as a doctor fighting AIDS for 21 years and every year I still hear the same debates. From a clinical viewpoint, the situation is very clear: we have about 30 anti-retroviral drugs that are able to prolong the lives of those with the HIV virus. We do not have any drug that is able to destroy the virus and, as a result, in the West and in Europe, we have seen a decrease in mortality and an increase in the number of people living with the HIV virus, who can technically be described as ‘potential vectors of infection’. This means that today, we have a greater risk of coming into contact with people with the HIV virus than in the past, because the number of HIV-positive survivors is increasing. In the midst of all this, what is being done? Nothing. The majority of European countries have not had any stable prevention campaigns for years. Prophylactics cost a lot and let us give the words a precise, recognisable name: prophylactics cost a lot and are one of the main ways of preventing the HIV virus. That is without mentioning damage-reduction projects aimed particularly at drug addicts to prevent the sharing of needles. How many countries carry out projects of this kind nationally? In Italy, 50% of confirmed AIDS diagnoses come at the same time as diagnoses of the HIV virus, which means that many people do not know they have HIV until they are ill. Where are the campaigns for increasing access to tests, which should be free and anonymous? We know that if there is discrimination, people will try to hide, they will not go to have the test, and this will entail risks for their own health and the health of others. One last point: today, again, the Council has spoken of aid to the global South, but I would like to know what happened to the proposals made by Parliament when we voted for the most recent version of TRIPS, which committed the Commission and the Council to increase funds for combating AIDS in the global South and, in particular, to transfer technologies and to transfer pharmacological aid.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to acknowledge that the Council has managed relations with Russia in a more balanced manner than the resolution adopted by the European Parliament on events in Georgia. In that resolution, all the accusations were levelled at Russia alone, and even the attack carried out by Georgia on 7 and 8 August was justified. If, however, we really care about stabilising peace, then we must say a clear ‘no’ to any accession by Georgia or Ukraine to NATO. We know that this would only serve to destabilise the entire region and greatly increase the likelihood of further wars. Negotiations with Russia should be resumed not only out of economic interest, but also because, until things are discussed, they do not go away, and this is always the best path. At the same time, we must be completely firm on human rights, freedom of information and political freedoms, which are certainly not the norm in Russia. The best way to be able to protect rights is not to be held hostage to energy; but in order to move away from our dependency on Russia we need not only to diversify the sources of our energy supplies but also to invest in alternative clean energies. I have one final observation to make. I have heard it said, both by the Commission and the Council, that they have enormous confidence in Russia joining the World Trade Organization. I would like to remind you that you made the same comments when China was joining the WTO, and we have seen the terrible results China’s accession has had on the European economy and European workers. Perhaps, then, we should look elsewhere for solutions: perhaps it is actually the entire mechanism of the World Trade Organization that we ought to call into question.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mrs Flautre on her excellent work. However, this was misrepresented, at least in part, by the Committee on Foreign Affairs during the vote, which caused the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to abstain, while only the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe approved the substantially amended text, precisely because the adoption of a series of amendments tabled by them altered its political balance. I also recall that my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, voted against this in committee. As a group, we recognise that the 13 amendments tabled, even if adopted, cannot alter the political tone of the report. Therefore, although we will be voting in favour of the majority of the amendments, our final vote remains critical. In our opinion, the problem is that international relations must be founded on dialogue and mutual respect, even if there is a difference of opinion. Sanctions such as these must be the last resort available to Member States and international organisations, yet the report hails them as the principal instrument of EU foreign policy. We also believe that priority should be given to so-called positive incentive measures. A country must be rewarded if it undertakes to promote and respect human rights by signing specific economic, trade and financial agreements. Instead, however, the report places the emphasis on negative measures, which strangely enough are always against the usual suspects, such as Cuba. These examples show how flawed the sanctions policy is. In short, we need more cooperation and less unilateral punishment. Not even the European Union has a monopoly on rights, as demonstrated by the insufferable way in which we treat migrants and Roma. Perhaps we should sanction ourselves!

 Mr President, the Ossetia and Abkhazia of today are yesterday’s Kosovo. None of the many governments now calling for peace in Georgia can deny their own responsibilities: by recognising Kosovo, the US and most of the European countries set a precedent which was bound to destabilise the Caucasus region. Owing to the expansion of NATO right up to Russia’s borders, the US is politically, even more than militarily, responsible for having encouraged Georgia to mount its surprise attack during the night of 7 to 8 August. Indeed, when attacking South Ossetia, Tbilisi thought it could count on protection from the United States, including military protection. It was an unjustifiable attack, which struck at civilians and shattered already highly fragile agreements. The Russian response had been prepared well in advance and was only awaiting an opportunity to unleash its full force. No governments are innocent in this affair! The sole victims are the civilian populations, whatever their allegiance, forced to abandon their homes and subject to all kinds of violence. We are witnessing a war where the nationalist aspirations of local leaders are overlaid by a clash of great powers over control of energy resources: the real reason for the conflict is the gas and oil pipelines running westwards from central Asia. Indeed, both the route through Turkey to the Mediterranean and the one from Georgia across Ukraine into Poland run through the Caucasus. It is no accident that the US asked Poland in particular to accommodate its missiles pointing to the east. Europe must work towards a peaceful solution, calling both for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgian territory and for the people there to have the right of self-determination. The EU must first and foremost assist the refugees and refrain from any political action likely to worsen the situation even further. Georgia’s entry into NATO must be flatly refused, the US fleet should be called upon to withdraw from the Black Sea, and Poland should be asked to reject the installation of the US missiles. We must be certain that our aid is not used to purchase weapons and that the refugees are not used as instruments of war by the conflicting parties.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely grateful to André Brie for the work he has done and fully support his decision to withdraw his signature. The resolution has been altered and now describes a country where there was reportedly a massive turnout at the elections, forgetting that the population voted under continuing threat from armed groups. No mention is made of the presence of warlords in the Karzai Government; there is no all-out condemnation of Operation Enduring Freedom, which is claiming civilian victims throughout the country. NATO action is supported, ignoring the fact that its presence in Afghanistan is a major cause of the total lack of security in that country at the moment. Moreover, faced with the ongoing rise in opium production, no reference is made to the possibility of launching pilot projects on the use of opium to produce morphine, even though a specific resolution to this effect has been adopted by the European Parliament. One positive aspect is undoubtedly the concern expressed about the fate of Malalai Joya and other activists, but that alone is not sufficient to prevent my delegation from voting against the report.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was exactly seventy years ago, on 14 July 1938, that the fascist regime in Italy enacted the Decree on race, falling into line with the German race laws. We know our history: more than 500 000 Roma were killed in the death camps. Then too, it all began with a census. In Italy we are witnessing a full-blown profiling of all Roma, including children, who are being fingerprinted, and including Community citizens and even Italian citizens, despite the fact that their details are already registered. The questionnaire used in Naples, Mr Angelilli, contains questions about religion and ethnic origin and is very similar to the one used by the Vichy Republic under the Nazi occupation. In Milan, they made a file on an old Roma, an Italian citizen, a survivor of deportation to the Nazi death camps. What use will be made of these data? Now in the Italian Parliament, chairing the Committee for Children – in total indifference and silence – is Alessandra Mussolini, the Duce’s granddaughter, a coincidence that reinforces the symbolic link between the present and a past that we thought was definitively dead and buried in Italy and in Europe, yet is rearing its ugly head again today. While history is not repeating itself, there is no doubt that the Italian Government has set in motion racist procedures that clearly run counter to Directives 2000/43/EC and 2004/38/EC. I call on Parliament to approve this resolution, condemning the Italian Government, and on the Commission to initiate infringement proceedings against Italy as a matter of urgency.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we will abstain on this resolution, especially in view of the way the Kurdish issue is side-stepped. In particular, I do not believe that Turkey’s actions in northern Iraq can be described merely as ‘disproportionate military operations’; instead we should assert that this is an open violation of international law. The Kurdish issue cannot be reduced solely to a social matter. It is first and foremost a political issue and we must tell the government in no uncertain terms that it must open talks with the local authorities in the Kurdish region and with the DTP. We cannot keep silent on the fact that there is no hint of a mention of the Luxembourg Court’s decision on the different status given to the PKK on terrorist lists as has been the case to date. We believe that there have been many appeals to Turkey on the Kurdish issue but that hitherto no substantive change whatsoever has been noted. This is the reason for our abstention.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, advocating and defending human rights today risk becoming hollow gestures, especially if statements of principle do not follow specific events. For some time the European Union has pretended to be helpless against regimes that violate human rights, interested only in the advancement of trade and economic relations. The Commission is increasingly undermined by the Council and the Member States in its strategies for promoting human rights throughout the world. For some time we have been witness to a conscious renationalisation of competences as regards the promotion of fundamental rights. Never before has the Commission been so weak in terms of proposals on human rights and democracy throughout the world, as demonstrated, for example, by the refusal to deploy the democracy clause that Parliament voted on two years ago. Human rights are once again at the mercy of economic or military control, as evidenced by the ‘war on terror’ of the Bush administration. For this reason, it is important that the European Parliament continues to play a galvanising role in this area, for example with reports like the one by Mr Cappato. Of course, this report focuses exclusively on one aspect of human rights, an aspect that I would call ‘individualistic’. Mr Cappato himself voted against our amendments, which sought to demonstrate how the promotion of human development and social, economic and cultural rights, as defined by the UN, are a prerequisite for the enjoyment of individual rights. It is these very concepts of interdependence and indivisibility of rights that define this idea. Yet again, the rapporteur has resorted to drawing up a blacklist of countries in which the usual suspects are attacked and the most powerful evade criticism. With these amendments, we tried for example to throw a spotlight on the fact that Turkey is guilty of a policy of wiping out the cultural, political and social identity of the Kurds. This repression affects millions of people, but nothing has been done. In my opinion, the Kurdish question is the key to the future of a democratic Europe, all this together with general and generic formulations about human rights, which smack of double standards. This is why our group decided to abstain in the final vote.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lebanese people and democratic civil society in that country are the victims of a political crisis decided elsewhere. On one side there is the United States, quick to play the Lebanese card against Syria and Hezbollah as part of its pro-Israeli stance to try to stabilise an area devastated by its illegal war against Iraq and to consolidate the military might of the State of Israel. It cannot allow itself to lose Lebanon. On the other side are Iran and Syria and their allied regimes that are playing out their contest for political, military, nuclear and regional supremacy in Lebanon. It does not matter if this means massacre, even the physical massacre, of the Lebanese. They do not want to lose Lebanon either. The European Union’s role is not to align itself with one or the other in this international chess match. As Europeans we need to do what we can to try to keep Lebanon politically united, by protecting its sovereignty and encouraging dialogue between the government coalition, Hezbollah and General Aoun, starting with the presidential elections. The person elected must be a candidate both parties are happy with. That is Lebanon. The secular, multi-faith nature of the country is a valuable asset for the whole of the international community, and particularly for Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the safeguarding of human rights in China does not begin and end with the Olympics. We did not await the Olympics to express our firm condemnation of the Chinese Government for failing to respect human rights and democratic guarantees. I would recall that we recently voted in this House against the proposal from the right and the conservatives to annul the embargo on arms sales to China. Then too, the background to that request was the desire of many Western governments not to compromise their dealings with Beijing. The same motive recently prompted President Bush to remove China from the list of countries committing the most severe human rights violations. Unfortunately, we have to realise that the old Latin proverb ‘pecunia non olet
’ (‘money does not smell’) is still extremely popular with our governments. The only point in boycotting the Olympics would be if the West really were prepared to give observance of human rights pride of place in international relations, but in that case the European Union would not only have opposed the idea of holding the Olympics in China; it would long since have included a democratic ‘observance of human rights’ clause as a binding condition in trade agreements with that country. None of this has happened, and the aim is still to protect the interests of large Western multinationals. Indeed, the value of trade between the United States and China amounts to $167 billion, and that between the European Union and China to $190 billion; 24 million Chinese workers are employed by foreign franchisees. That is why the earth’s major powers believe they should rely on China as a safety raft for their economies and tolerate its infringements of fundamental rights. Chinese capitalism was convinced that years of rapid economic growth would dampen separatist demands, but this has not been the case, primarily because the Chinese have never bothered to ask the Tibetans what model of economic growth they would like. However, Tibet is by no means the sole example of China's failure to respect human rights. We are witnessing on a daily basis the closure of numerous popular newspapers and international websites, increasing discrimination against migrant workers from rural areas, thousands of whom are, for example, excluded from health insurance, and thousands of members of Protestant, Catholic and unofficial churches being imprisoned and tortured, not to mention the repression of the Uyghur community, the forced labour camps and the death penalty, which is still widely applied to punish about 68 non-violent economic crimes. Symbolic acts are all very well, of course, but by themselves they serve only to allay our consciences. We are convinced that the months between now and the Olympics represent a unique opportunity for the international community, and in particular the European Union, to oblige the Beijing Government – not only diplomatically, but also through specific trade-related initiatives – to release all those who have been arrested, guarantee the independent media access to Tibet, and open negotiations with both the Tibetan Parliament-in-exile and the political movements leading the protests on the ground, in order to reach a peaceful, diplomatic, agreed solution that is respectful of the rights and choices of the Tibetan people.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are positively disposed towards the Gomes report, which contains some distinctive points such as defence of territorial integrity and the need for a reconciliation process within Iraq. At the same time, however, we believe that the European Union must call upon Turkey to put an immediate end to its invasion of northern Iraq. We also endorse the call for the revenue from petroleum sales to be invested for the good of Iraq, but we cannot ignore the laws laid down by the United States, which have handed over Iraq’s energy resources to large US multinationals, allowing them to export all the proceeds and make huge profits. One such company is that of Vice-President Cheney, Halliburton. We can certainly endorse the call for transparency concerning the rules and legal status for contractor organisations, but we cannot ignore the fact that there are private armies employing tens of thousands of people in Iraq operating completely outside of any rules. The report calls for the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports to be made legally binding, but we cannot forget that this war has cost $6 000 billion, which could otherwise have been invested in attaining the Millennium Goals. This war and occupation have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths; this war and occupation were, and still are, illegal, entered into in complete violation of international law, unilaterally and against the wishes of the majority of Member States, the United Nations and international public opinion. We should call for the immediate withdrawal of the occupying troops. They must be replaced by a UN mission geared solely to guaranteeing security; all belligerent activity must cease.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for what she has said and for the commitments she has made, which also seem to me to be in line with what the European Parliament has said on many occasions in its resolutions, but these promises to act are not enough in themselves. I would like to ask what tools the Commission uses and what it can tell us about the use of the funds which, under various expenditure headings, have to date been made available to Member States for Roma inclusion. Secondly, what checks is it making on the concrete implementation at national level of the directives adopted? Thirdly, I join with those asking that there be a single figure within the Commission handling all issues relating to the Roma. To turn to my country, I must stress that we face a very strong wave of racism and stigmatisation, chiefly towards the Roma, particularly since Italy has not fully transposed Directive 43/2000/EC against ethnic discrimination. What measures does the Commission intend to take with regard to this? Italian law has not transposed the concept of racial harassment, the issue of the sharing of the burden of proof or protection from abuse suffered as a result of racial discrimination. Further, I ask the Commission if it knows that in one major Italian municipality – namely Milan – migrant children, who in this case are mainly Roma, whose parents are not in a regular position with the law and do not have a residence permit, cannot attend state schools. This seems to me to run completely counter to all the EU’s documents, to contradict the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and also the resolution we adopted this morning on the rights of the child. Finally, I would like to point out that the Italian Government is discussing the nth decree-law on an issue which is in fact really to do with the Roma, and that is whether it is possible to include a reference to economic ends among the grounds that may be given to justify the removal of a citizen of another Member State from the country, in this case from Italy. Behind the general issue of immigration, this decree is in fact directed specifically at the Roma. I would like to know your views.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am a doctor who has been working with AIDS for twenty years and I have to say that, frankly, I would have expected much more detailed and pragmatic proposals from the Commission. In the European Union, sexual relations are the main channel of transmission. To be more specific: 1) Is the Commission urging all the Member States to organise sex education classes in schools? 2) Is it urging Member States to introduce price controls on condoms which are at present the only way of blocking sexual transmission? In Europe the second main channel of transmission is intravenous, especially among those using drugs. What, then, is the Commission doing to urge Member States to implement damage limitation strategies which are the only way in which intravenous transmission can be reduced among those who are unable, cannot or do not want to give up drugs? As regards the rest of the world, I would have expected the Commission to come here and tell us: after eight months of deadlock with Parliament, we note that Parliament has voted to amend Article 6 of the TRIPS Agreement and, while that that has not led to any amendment, the Commission is committed to fighting to amend the WTO rules. At present, the TRIPS rules allow multinationals to hold patents for twenty year with the result that drugs do not get to Africa. We have heard absolutely nothing about that! If those rules are not changed, speaking of Africa is no more than hot air! Lastly, how is it possible, when everyone is talking about the fight against AIDS, that you have Commissioner Mandelson writing letters to the Thai Government asking it not to pass laws making it possible to distribute generics and, in his letters, sponsoring and naming companies such as Sanofi-Avensis? In my view, the Commission should have something to say about that!

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Foreign Affairs supports Commissioner Michel's proposal for an interinstitutional declaration on the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid, but the individual governments of the 27 Member States are still pursuing national policy goals on humanitarian aid, which sometimes differ substantially from Europe's goals. The Council and the Member States must make humanitarian aid a moral and political imperative, inspired more by the effectiveness of that aid than by national or post-colonial interests. We cannot confine ourselves to distributing rice and bread, however necessary that may be. The EU’s humanitarian aid must be accompanied by political and diplomatic activity that makes compliance with international law, especially international humanitarian law, a priority for the so-called recipient state. The principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence must be safeguarded and kept distinct from any active military intervention in the field of humanitarian aid. Failure to comply with these principles could be prejudicial both to humanitarian workers and to the populations concerned. It is important to remember, too, that in humanitarian aid operations particular attention should be paid to the most vulnerable groups such as women and children.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not a matter simply of observing that 92% of opium in the world is produced in Afghanistan but of noting the upward trend: in 2001, according to data from the UN drugs agency, 8 000 hectares were given over to opium growing while in 2006 it was 165 000; 185 tons were harvested in 2001, 6 100 in 2006. This obviously means that the current strategy of destroying crops by fumigation solves nothing. Rather, it has social consequences that will subsequently cause opium production to spiral. Crops other than opium poppies are destroyed, so farmers become ever poorer and end up in the hands of drug traffickers, namely the Taliban and the warlords sitting comfortably in government. The goal is therefore to provide farmers with support which at least initially must be at the same financial level as now, freeing them from dependence on drug traffickers. This plan will not solve the problem, of course, but no one is claiming that it will. We are talking about an experiment in a limited area, and it could not be otherwise in a war-torn country where land is controlled by rival gangs. It nevertheless constitutes a step forward, in that at least part of that opium will not end up as heroin, but as morphine. That, I believe, is beneficial for the West and the entire world. Besides, I think we must clarify the fact that there is already provision for morphine production. I am not aware, Commissioner, that all these problems exist in India and Turkey; if so, regulation is needed. The resolution before us, however, envisages a regulatory role for international bodies: not over Afghanistan as a whole, which is unmanageable at present, but over an extremely limited area. Furthermore, international medical associations are making plain that there is still a need for morphine today, not only in the South of the world, but paradoxically in the North too. It must of course be sold at official prices, but it is a painkiller and in my opinion everyone is entitled to it, including African people and poor people. If we are talking about expense, it undoubtedly costs less to take action of this kind and to place price controls on morphine, rather than deciding to destroy crops using the existing methods which get us nowhere. One last comment: I welcome the fact that this has been a pragmatic debate, not an argument between those wishing to liberalise or legalise drugs and prohibitionism. We are trying to take practical, pragmatic action to assist part of the Afghan population.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while the anti-discrimination directive is a very good directive and of considerable ethical value, a number of European countries are doing little or nothing at all to transpose the directive and its content into their own law, and in practice racial and ethnic abuse is the order of the day. Italy, for instance, is facing infringement proceedings by the European Union for its failure to transpose this Directive. The European Union contends in particular that Italy has failed to transpose the notion of racial harassment into national law, lacks a law reversing the burden of proof, and has no specific provisions to protect against racial and ethnic abuse. Last December, in Opera, a municipality close to Milan, a group of citizens led by the leaders of the national Lega di Alleanza literally hunted down and set fire to tents sheltering thirty or so Roma children. In Pavia, dozens of Roma were chased off with shouts of ‘gas chambers’. On the outskirts of Rome, only a few days ago, 40 hooded attackers armed with sticks, knives and Molotov cocktails attacked a Roma camp in Ponte Mammolo during the night. In Italy, almost every day, one or more travellers’ camps are cleared by the local authorities, without the Roma having the most elementary rights. Is this the particular social protection for which the report calls, especially following enlargement, for the Roma? I would also like to stress that the sanctions applicable to breaches of national provisions adopted in accordance with the Directive must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. I would also point out that on 25 April, we approved… (The President cut off the speaker)

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the export mechanism provided for in the decision of 30 August 2003 has added such a number of restrictions and administrative/technical obstacles that to date, as is pointed out by ‘Médecins sans frontières’ in a publication from September 2006, it has never been used. Parliament asked the Commission and the Council to make a specific commitment in its resolution of 2 December 2004. On 30 November 2006 the European Parliament again adopted a determined position on the issue of access to medicines in the south of the world and unanimously adopted a resolution calling on the Commission, and I quote, ‘to recognise, five years after the adoption of the Doha Declaration, that its application has been a failure, inasmuch as the WTO has received no notification from an exporting or importing country of compulsory medicines nor any such notification under the Decision of 30 August 2003 of the General Council of the WTO on implementing paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration’. Secondly, Parliament called on them ‘to take the necessary steps within the WTO, in association with the developing countries, to modify the TRIPS Agreement and its provisions based on the Decision of 30 August 2003 …, in order in particular to abolish the complex and time-consuming procedural steps in the authorisation of compulsory licences’. So far, six months later, neither the Council nor the Commission, despite having been requested to do so by all the parliamentary groups, has not dignified the European Parliament with any reply. Defending to the bitter end a mechanism such as that of 30 August 2003, reproduced word for word in the amendment to the TRIPS agreements that the EU would like to ratify, signifies a very clear choice of sides: it means siding with the large pharmaceutical multinationals and abandoning millions of patients in poor countries to the mercy of diseases that, in their case, are fatal, such as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and dozens of other forgotten illnesses, without research or treatment. This is a choice that this Chamber, convinced as it is of the primacy of human rights for all over the profit of a few, cannot accept.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wonder whether the Commission and the Council are here to pull our legs. I intend to ask the Presidency if I can have a recording of this part-session, because I believe that playing it in Africa will explain better than any words the absolute and utter indifference of the Council and the European Commission to the problem of access to medicines. All the groups are putting this question to you concerning a regulation that has been in force for three years but not once implemented; are you replying that this regulation will allow developing countries access to medicines? But it has not allowed it for three years! What, do you have a magic wand? That is as far as the Council is concerned. The Commission tells us: ‘We have worked so hard to reach this agreement’. But if it does not work – regardless of whether a large or small amount of work has been done – the agreement must be amended or in any event we need to find other ways to make progress. The Commission and the Council also talk about ‘asking the pharmaceutical firms to offer lower prices for the south of the world’, which amounts to saying: ‘Let the pharmaceutical firms themselves do a good deed, because we are completely unable to guarantee a right’. They also talk of ‘increasing local production capacity in the south of the world’. But how? There is endless talk of the transfer of technologies, but absolutely nothing is being transferred to the south of the world. These regulations hinder production! They are just fine words, and then you come here to say that the Millennium Development Goals are being achieved in this way. It seems to me that there is a total lack of interest on the part of the Commission and the Council in the issue that we have raised.

 Mr President, I propose adding the following text to the end of paragraph 9: ‘deplores that the Italian Government has not yet paid the EUR 260 million it owes for the 2006-2007 quota to the Global Fund To Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and invites the Italian Government to settle this debt shortly’.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the G8 has been a resounding failure in the fight against poverty and global warming. The tired rituals of a summit that, although legitimate, is now anti-historical, given the resistance to the inclusion of new emerging countries such as Brazil, South Africa, China and India, are reflected in the lack of substance of its final declarations. In 2005, in Scotland, the rich countries solemnly undertook to increase public development aid to 50 billion dollars per year by 2010, half of which was supposed to be given to Africa, so as to ensure that the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations for 2015 would be achieved. Two years on, as shown by the Africa Progress Panel chaired by Kofi Annan, actual appropriations represent only 10% of what was promised. As though nothing were the matter, in Rostock the G8 countries issued a new commitment to grant funding of 60 billion dollars to combat AIDS, all in very vague and deliberately misleading terms. No deadline was set and half of the amount is in fact recycled from commitments already made by the US Administration up to 2013. The increase of 3 billion per year over the commitments already made by the other governments, including the European ones, is completely insufficient to tackle the humanitarian emergency of AIDS and other pandemics. On global warming a failure to make a decision was welcomed as a success. The result of three days of meetings, at a cost of 120 million euros, was to send back to the UN a possible agreement on restricting the quantities of carbon dioxide to be emitted into the atmosphere. It will not be possible to achieve any promise without calling into question the dominant economic and social models.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, roaming costs are coming down, but Europe is coming to this issue late, and it will continue to be consumers who pay the consequences. For years, the European Commission has taken no measures to protect its citizens and has left the telephone companies to come to agreements between themselves, creating cartels that for consumers translate into throwing money down the drain. Independent studies, such as that by the Association of European Consumers, have shown that mobile telephone operators bill their customers EUR 3.52 billion too much every year. The actual cost of a minute’s roaming is between 10 and 14 cents, roughly; operators resell it for an average of EUR 1.06, meaning that the gap between prices and costs is over 600%. Faced with such high margins, we were expecting a more serious proposal with regard to consumers, instead of what has been put before this Chamber: a deduction of 49 cents, which means succumbing to the demands of the Council and telephony operators. Yes, the proposal is necessary, and represents a small step forward, but just lowering prices does not do enough to protect consumers, does not compensate them for the exploitation they have suffered and instead continues to penalise them further.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened with great interest to the reports by the Council and the Commission, and as a member of the delegation of parliamentary observers at the presidential elections, I can fully confirm everything that has been said so far. The elections were definitely not conducted in compliance with international standards, since the standards laid down at international level were not reached, nor even the standards of the African states themselves. There was even a postponement in the opening time of polling stations that was decided on and notified only the day before, so that the majority of the population was unaware of it. Most of the polling stations closed early. There was an absence of any kind of secret ballot – and I could go on indefinitely, mentioning, for example, an electoral commission that was independent solely in name, but in fact was closely linked to the government. I would also like to mention the intimidating atmosphere. Hauwa Ibrahim, holder of the 2005 Sakharov prize, was supposed to meet our delegation in a public place but requested a change in the location of the appointment because she did not feel sufficiently safe. I would like to move the debate on to what can be done in the future. We absolutely must call for investigations into the electoral irregularities, call for an independent electoral commission, call for the Court of Appeal to be truly independent in dealing with electoral appeals and verify this, and state that new elections are necessary. We cannot, however, stop at just this, and I already see in the background the risk that the political choices of the Council are tending in the direction of continuing as if nothing was the matter. Let us not conceal the reason – some people may think that what matters is to have a government that is more or less legitimised, but in a country from which we can continue to buy oil. This cannot be the solution. I would like to ask what the intentions are with regard to using some instruments that the European Union possesses. For example, there is the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. Are we able to verify that the Nigerian Government remains uninvolved in the selection and implementation of projects that are financed by this instrument? I would like to ask the Commissioner, as I have already done on other occasions, what is happening with the democratic clause on rights, which was adopted by a very large majority within this Parliament, but never accepted by the Commission or the Council. It has never been transformed into the powerful tool that it could be, and in this case it could be extremely useful to place trade with Europe in the scales too, from the viewpoint of democratic progress. Last, but not least, there is the issue of what role Europe intends to play regarding events in the Niger delta. It does not seem adequate to me that individual States should do their utmost and be prepared to pay ransoms when someone is seized. We must call for a start in talks, relations and meetings between the Nigerian Government and the representatives of local people, putting pressure not only on the government but also on the large European companies operating in that region without any respect for human rights or environmental rights.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic partnership agreement negotiations as conducted by the Commission with the backing of the Council are threatening the economic and food sovereignty of the ACP countries and jeopardising any remaining possibility for these countries to consolidate their own productive sectors by increasing the added value of their own production; they are thus leaving them open to the risk of further deindustrialisation. The social and environmental impacts of indiscriminately opening up local markets to international investment, which is mainly directed towards natural resources and the produce of the land itself, would exacerbate the lack of any effective economic return for the people of those countries. The only ones to benefit would be the large European multinationals. On chapters such as the so-called Singapore issues, the trade in services and intellectual property rights, we will, moreover, have even stricter rules than those set by the WTO itself. A WTO Plus agreement will push the people of Africa even further into the abyss of poverty. The stability of entire rural communities is at risk in Africa, as are thousands of manufacturing jobs. Without work, there is nothing left for people to do but migrate, trying their luck on those dilapidated boats that have again invaded Europe’s Mediterranean shores in recent days. As the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we are calling for the EPA negotiations as they have been set up to be closed and for a new start to be made on different bases, focusing on social justice, solidarity and the self-development of peoples. In our view it is inconceivable and illogical that, while the Doha Round talks are stuck, the Commission should not want the EPA negotiations to allow for any departure from the negotiating deadline. The whole European Union should instead do all it can within the WTO to gain recognition for a transitional regime, under which a trade preference system benefiting the ACP countries will be maintained until such time as a new agreement is finalised. For all these reasons, and for others that I have no time to mention here, my group has decided to vote against the Sturdy report.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the nuclear crises in North Korea and Iran have once again spread fear throughout the world and triggered suspicion between nations and peoples. The international debate on nuclear rearmament has again called the future of mankind into question. We must restart negotiations with Iran and shun any military action, as this would only serve to exacerbate the current crisis. It is therefore vital to relaunch debate regarding the renewal of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2010. The European Union must apply suitable political, economic and commercial pressure on countries such as India, Pakistan, Iran, North Korea and other countries such as China and the United States. In addition, the European Union must, as a matter of the utmost urgency, promote a Mediterranean free of nuclear weapons. By means of suitable economic and social policies we must transform the Mediterranean into a sea of peace – an area that is completely non-nuclear. This is why we must apply the pressure we have mentioned to Israel too, which certainly has the right to look after its own security but which must not be founded upon nuclear fear and the annihilation of other peoples. In addition, the recent decision by President Bush to install missile launchers in the Czech Republic or new military nuclear surveillance installations in Poland only worsens military relations with Russia. This decision by President Bush is one that I must condemn immediately.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to realise that Turkey is playing a game with Europe and with the negotiations over its accession to the European Union. The democratic reform process is at a complete standstill in Ankara. The revocation of Article 301 of the Criminal Code on the freedom of expression has been shelved sine die
, and the Cyprus issue has turned into a dance of proposals and counterproposals from Mr Erdoğan, which in reality are attempts to avoid the fundamental question of ratification of the Ankara Protocol. That is not to mention the Kurdish issue and the recognition of the Kurdish people’s fundamental rights, which have so far been denied. I confirm that my group is in favour of Turkey’s accession to the European Union, but it is now clear that Prime Minister Erdoğan has decided to respond more to extremist nationalism and the Turkish Kemalist military than to Europe. Instead of making democracy and the rule of law the cardinal points of a new policy for modernising Turkey in the context of the accession negotiations, Mr Erdoğan has clearly chosen to be the leader of old Turkey, at least for now. We therefore endorse the Commission’s decision to materially suspend negotiations on eight important chapters in the bilateral treaties. Turkey should understand that the doors to Europe remain open, but they remain open to a democratic Turkey that respects people’s rights and the fundamental freedoms of all – both Turks and Kurds – in Turkey. The ball is now in Mr Erdoğan’s court.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissioner’s speech sounds frankly rhetorical: it is full of fine statements, which are not matched by an equally positive role on the part of the European Commission. As the latest data from UNAIDS demonstrate, the number of HIV infections is continuing to grow and, in some countries, we are even seeing a fresh outbreak of the virus. Faced with all of this, patented drugs continue to be unaffordable, and the TRIPS agreements are creating an insurmountable obstacle to access to medicines, condemning almost three million people to death each year. The ones taking advantage of this situation are the multinational pharmaceutical companies, which recorded a 24% increase in their profits in 2005; these multinationals are protected by the US Administration, which has never stopped using its political and commercial weight to influence the negotiations on pharmaceutical patents. At multilateral level, the Bush administration’s agenda is aimed at making the safeguard clauses laid down by the TRIPS agreements unenforceable, clauses which, in the event of a health crisis, would allow the member countries to bypass intellectual property rights and to have access to lifesaving drugs. However, while the United States can be rightly accused of attacking one of the most basic human rights, that of health care, Europe certainly cannot consider itself blameless. The inertia shown by the Commission and the Member States when it comes to equipping themselves with a Community regulation that is genuinely able to implement the Doha Declaration must be well and truly condemned. Commissioner, you said that a few thousand Africans were receiving treatment, but, in Africa, 30 million people are HIV-positive, 6.5 million of whom require treatment. Tomorrow is World AIDS Day: global civil society is asking once and for all for politics to shoulder its responsibilities, which concern not only the issue of access to medicines but also the funding allocated to prevention and research programmes. The creation of an international market in generic medicines, supported by a new system of medical research geared towards people’s real needs, remains the crucial issue. For this reason, we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left believe that it is crucial for the resolution on which the House will vote to commit the Commission and the Council to: 1) acknowledge the failure of the decision of 30 August 2003; 2) propose within the WTO to amend the TRIPS agreements and the new procedures for granting compulsory licences, which must be able to respond swiftly to health emergencies caused by the HIV epidemic; 3) allocate EUR 1 billion to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, as was already requested by Parliament on 2 December 2004 and ignored by the Commission and the Council; 4) dedicate more resources to research into medicines designed to treat diseases specifically affecting the south of the world and oblige the private sector, which has always benefited from public research, to set aside a reasonable amount of its own research for these neglected diseases. Too much time and energy has been wasted on making false promises; it is now time to act!

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group is of course in favour of a general, worldwide ban on the production and use of biological weapons and on trade in them, and we hope that the forthcoming Geneva Conference will decide to strengthen the relevant international conventions. I am pleased to note that the European Union is in the forefront on these issues, and I hope that the Commission will do everything humanly possible to achieve a worldwide ban on these horrific weapons. We have to acknowledge the fact, however, that the main stumbling block to achieving such a ban has a name that we all know: George W. Bush. The President of the United States is personally responsible for the US political boycott of the Geneva negotiations. He has, in fact, decided to pull out of the talks. Instead, the United States has made the build-up of their biological arsenal and the use of white phosphorus and depleted uranium a strong point in their aggressive and unacceptable military policy. Similarly, they have neither ratified the Mine Ban Convention nor signed the Third Protocol to the Certain Conventional Weapons Convention (CCWC), and they have also revived the Star Wars programme. This attitude by the United States is a threat to world security. The European Union needs to overcome its inertia and make putting pressure on the United States a key point in the Geneva negotiations.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the humanitarian and political situation in Darfur is getting worse from one day to the next. According to Jan Egeland, the UN coordinator for humanitarian aid, the humanitarian situation has deteriorated since 2004: entire regions of Darfur have been left without any humanitarian personnel because the Khartoum government is preventing international agencies from gaining access. The persecution of the civilian population by the notorious Janjaweed – armed gangs financed and supported by the Sudanese central government – now looks very much like genocide. The international community cannot just stand by and look on, now that the forces sent in by the Organisation for African Unity to protect the civilian population have practically failed. Their lack of any political and military credibility is now beyond doubt. That is why we support UN intervention under Security Council Resolution 1706, which the Sudanese Government stubbornly disregards. The peacekeeping troops proposed under Resolution 1706 now need to be deployed in order to protect hundreds of thousands of women, men and children who for too long have been suffering attacks from the Janjaweed, even though previous UN resolutions have rightly called for them to be disbanded. It would be even better, of course, if the Sudanese Government approved the deployment of the UN force; I hope it will, and I also think that the Arab League countries should put more effective pressure on Khartoum to accept the UN resolution. At the same time, however, any kind of Sudanese veto against the United Nations would be unacceptable: there are hundreds of thousands of innocent lives at stake, and we need to do something for them. Otherwise, the entire credibility of the international community will be called into question. It is therefore crucial that the UN be allowed to send its humanitarian personnel into the whole Darfur region; otherwise it will be impossible for humanitarian aid to be distributed properly. Sudan has to realise that it must cooperate with the United Nations in order to be fully accepted into the international community.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has voted in favour of opening negotiations with Turkey, but we believe that those negotiations must centre on respect for human rights and democracy, and that such respect must be indissolubly linked to the political and diplomatic solution to the Kurdish question. Last week, I took part in the Subcommittee on Human Rights’ visit to Turkey, and I have come back with a very different impression to the one I had hoped for. In particular, we found a tragic situation in Turkish Kurdistan, that is, it was a completely militarised zone. It is one thing for us all to condemn terrorism, but it is quite something else to regard an entire population as terrorists, to imprison minors merely for giving the V-sign, to persist with the logic of torture and to dismiss those judges who, for example, investigate police officers held responsible for an attack. We, as Parliament, must support the DTP’s call for a ceasefire and we must call on the PKK to respond positively to that appeal. We must call on the Turkish Government to begin immediate talks with the DTP with the aim of reaching a political solution, as there is no other possible alternative. However, the problems do not just concern the Kurdish issue: we were all delighted with the solution reached regarding Elif Shafak, just as we were previously with the one regarding Orhan Pamuk, but there is a danger that this is window dressing just for the West: there are at least another 80 writers and journalists who are standing trial under Article 301. At the same time, the Turkish Parliament has approved the anti-terrorism law in its original wording, despite opposition not only from Europe, but also from the United Nations. Furthermore, we have been able to ascertain that, in Hakkari Province, which is also in the Kurdish area, 7 000 out of the 250 000 people living there are village guardians, and so we have a situation where a police force – the disbandment of which the European Union has been requesting for some time – is directly answerable to the government. The commitment that we are asking Parliament, the Commission and the Council to make is to continue down the road of holding talks with Turkey, but with a focus on human rights and not just on ideological debates or economic interests. We believe that the future can bring a Europe that is multi-ethnic and multi-faith, but there must always be respect for everyone’s human rights.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a pacifist, I have never believed that peace could be achieved by means of arms. I am therefore not overjoyed at sending troops to Lebanon but, realistically, I realise that we are dealing with a damage-limitation intervention, which is the only possible way to get Israel to withdraw from Lebanon. The more neutral the peacekeeping forces remain, however, the more credible they will be. Therefore Italy and the other nations involved in UNIFIL must immediately break off all military aid agreements with Israel, such as the one signed by Italy two years ago. If the aim is to achieve a lasting peace, troops are not enough, and so I call on the European Union to organise the deployment of civilian peace corps as well along the Lebanese-Israeli border, with their own mandate and managed separately from the military mission. We should support the call already made by humanitarian groups for a UN committee of inquiry into possible war crimes committed by Israel against civilians, including the use of cluster bombs and the bombing of civilian infrastructure. I agree with the Council’s assessment that there can be no lasting peace in the Middle East without respect for the rights of the Palestinian people. The European Union should therefore formally propose to send in a buffer force between Palestine and Israel as well, and to demand that Israel comply with all the UN resolutions.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the results so far achieved during the Doha Round and the outcome of the TRIPS agreement on access to medicinal products are having disastrous effects on the living standards of millions of human beings. It is quite clear that the slogan ‘Free trade = poverty reduction’ was just bait to persuade the southern, poorest countries of the world to endorse the expectations of the industrialised countries. The real reason for the suspension of the WTO talks was that it was impossible to reach an agreement among the six main nations, which were determined to defend the interests of their agribusinesses; the other 143 countries were excluded from the negotiations. According to the FAO, the breakdown was due to having focused all the talks on free trade instead of fair trade. It is better to have no agreement at all than a bad agreement! The suspension of the talks may provide an opportunity for reviewing the Commission’s negotiating mandate, which should concentrate on: 1) reforming the WTO to make it more transparent, more inclusive and more democratic, embedded within the UN system, and bound in its decision-making by the framework of international law; 2) reviewing the three main agreements now on the agenda: agriculture, intellectual property and services; 3) providing a binding frame of reference for the activities of transnational companies; 4) making respect for the rights of peoples a condition of free trade, by ensuring that the human rights clause, as approved by Parliament on 14 February, is observed; 5) refusing at bilateral or regional level to sidestep the rules agreed upon at multilateral level, taking the EPA talks with the ACP countries as an example.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the continual homophobic attacks in Europe are a symptom of a crisis in democracy that this Parliament needs to address, above all when they take place in European Union Member States such as Poland. The far-right Polish Government, which is suppressing the civil rights of the homosexual community, needs to realise that such conduct is incompatible with membership of the European Union. The recent gay pride march in Warsaw was only authorised because of pressure from Europe. Poland must understand that, if homophobic attacks continue, my group will not hesitate to call for possible political sanctions for breach of Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union and of the fundamental democratic principles of the Union. It is also crucial that the 2001 framework decision on racism and xenophobia be extended also to cover the crime of homophobia, a legal category that already exists in France and Belgium. I am disconcerted by the Austrian Presidency’s failure to move on these issues and I wonder whether it may not be due to the fact that Mr Haider’s neo-fascist party forms part of the government in Vienna. I challenge the Council, which is present here today, to say something in that regard. I therefore hope that the Finnish Presidency will inject some civilised attitudes into this Europe that has fallen prey to dangerous new fiends.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the violation of human rights in Tunisia has now taken a shocking turn. The Tunisian Government has prevented the Tunisian League for Human Rights from holding its congress by deploying police and secret services. That is unacceptable. I must point out that the Tunisian league is an integral part of the International League for Human Rights, which is a key partner in discussions with EU institutions. Not only did the police physically prevent the meeting from taking place, but they also mistreated our fellow Member Mrs Flautre, to whom I offer my full personal solidarity and that of our parliamentary group as a whole. I should also like to extend our solidarity to Mr Mokhtar Trifi, the president of the Tunisian League for Human Rights, and all his colleagues. I must also point out that the funds that the Commission has allocated for projects to promote human rights remain blocked. The whole European Union is politically being held hostage by a government that has decided to trample on human rights. The time has come, therefore, to react. The European Commission must stop hiding behind the divisions within the Council of the European Union and behind the vetoes imposed by France in particular. I formally call for the Commission to start the procedures for calling an extraordinary meeting of the EU-Tunisia Association Council, in order to evaluate the state of political and civil liberties in the country. We must not be afraid to raise the additional possibility of suspending the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement on the basis of Article 2 thereof. I say this also in my capacity as rapporteur on the democratic clause, which was unanimously approved by the European Parliament and gives us full political legitimacy to call for suspension of the agreement and to ask for the Subcommittee on Human Rights to be urgently convened. The Commission and the Council, on the other hand, tell us that they intend to continue cowering to a despotic government that, from Tunis, thinks it can tell them what to do in Brussels. In that case, however, I do not think that Parliament will be on your side.

 Mr President, regarding the vote on the issue of paediatric medicines, I should just like to point out that, after the six-month patent extension granted to the multinational drug companies at first reading, I feel that extending the transition period during which that additional protection certificate can be applied for from two years to five years is really going too far. That is why I voted against Amendment 18, and also because the benefits to the paediatric population cannot be scientifically documented. In addition, accepting that amendment might encourage research into paediatric indications for medicines produced for adult use, precisely going against one of the aims of the regulation.

Mr President, I would ask that Amendment 7 to paragraph 1, in which a proposal has been made to add 'in particular in China, Belarus, Cuba and North Korea’, also include the words: ‘Colombia, Turkey and Tunisia’. Paragraph 1 would therefore become the following: ‘is concerned at the high number of journalists being convicted worldwide, in particular in China, Belarus, Cuba, North Korea, Colombia, Turkey and Tunisia'.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Howitt report represents a significant advance on the past insofar as it tries to analyse the effects of the European Union's human rights policies and, above all, their effectiveness with regard to third countries. The first, significant difference of this report comes in the shape of a request for subsequent annual reports to include an assessment of whether the democracy clause, which was adopted on 14 February, is actually being complied with. I must point out, however, that neither the Council nor the Commission has given any precise indication of the way in which it intends to incorporate that human rights and democracy clause in the commercial dealings between Europe and third countries. As regards the fledgling UN Commission for Human Rights, the document to be voted on calls on the European Union to support the activities of that body and, at the same time, promotes the universal ratification of the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court, especially on the part of the United States, for which no legal exception can be made. The document in question also specifically condemns the bilateral agreements that a number of EU countries have drawn up with the United States for the purposes of guaranteeing impunity to US soldiers. Lastly, it calls on the European Union to take a consistent approach to human rights, in the specific cases of China, with regard to the Tibetan people, and of Guantánamo, on the subject of which it calls for the immediate closure of all of the detention centres. Nevertheless, I cannot fail to mention some shortcomings of the report too. It does not in fact make any reference to the European Union’s failure to commit itself to supporting human rights on the occasion of the sixth WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong. On the subject of Iraq, moreover, Article 38 is too vague: it does not criticise the human rights violations carried out by the occupying forces, or the use of illegal weapons such as, for instance, the white phosphorous used in Falluja. Finally, on the subject of Colombia, Article 41 is not as explicit as the situation of the Latin American country's citizens would, on the contrary, require, such as in the case of the residents of peace communities who have been affected by countless massacres where the perpetrators have gone unpunished. The report fails, in fact, to firmly condemn the climate of violence in the country and to acknowledge a correlation between this situation and the recent legislative measures, such as the ‘Peace and justice’ law, which actually allow paramilitary forces to become part of the Colombian army. I have one final observation to make: although I support the request for the European Union's annual report on human rights to provide for the involvement of the European Parliament, I do, however, think it just as necessary that Parliament continues to draft its own specific report, with the aim of ensuring that Parliament monitors the European Commission's practical commitment towards human rights and of assessing that monitoring effort.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group cannot vote in favour of the agreement with Morocco because its entry into force would be as good as a violation of international law. The proposed definition of Moroccan territorial waters as including waters that actually belong to Western Sahara means trampling on the Sahrawi people's rights, which are clearly defined by the United Nations, particularly its right to self-determination, which is already included in the declaration. We are all aware that, for many years now, the Moroccan Government has done everything in its power to stop a referendum from being held on the independence of Western Sahara. Instead of putting pressure on Rabat to go down the road of a diplomatic solution, by signing the agreement under discussion today, the Union is in danger of sending out the wrong signal, by legitimising a form of occupation that has been denounced for years. A few part-sessions ago, we voted in favour of a resolution that called for the sovereignty of the Sahrawi people over the resources of that country to be upheld. I believe that we need to reaffirm this point, by doing what my group tried to do and denouncing those parts of the agreement in which Morocco absorbs Sahrawi territorial waters. Finally, I believe that this agreement demonstrates a need to include the democratic clause in all of the fishing agreements reached between the Union and third countries. In February, Parliament unanimously adopted my report on that subject. It is unacceptable that, as in that case, the Union and Morocco are doing business at the Sahrawi people's expense. Respect for international rights, and therefore for the sovereignty of Western Sahara, must be a prerequisite if EU-Morocco relations are to develop further.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Doha Round has been reduced to a typical negotiation designed to increase liberalisations to the advantage of large economic groups and, as such, it is a failure. Despite the fact that it has been labelled the development round, it is precisely developing countries that will end up being the main losers, as, moreover, it transpired from a report commissioned by the World Bank itself from an independent group. Furthermore, the continuation, until 2013, of the European export subsidies for agricultural products and of the US subsidies for the cotton industry will cause a further social disaster in developing countries. The wealthy countries’ request that the developing countries’ tariffs be abolished or greatly reduced will further accentuate the negative trend for those regions. Moreover, the possibility of keeping import tariffs on 3% of the products that are currently protected will enable the United States, for example, to reinforce the tariff protection on as many as 420 products, and it is very easy to imagine that the products safeguarded in extremis
 will include those very products that are of the greatest importance to the poorest countries. That is not to mention the review of the TRIPS agreements which, aside from all the rhetoric, will make it even more difficult for all those countries in the south of the world to gain access to medicines. In conclusion, I believe that the report neither highlights those aspects nor points out that the WTO in fact represents an unfulfilled promise of an essential form of multilateralism designed to distribute wealth more effectively.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Morgantini report is an important attempt to restrict the damage caused by the EPAs. Do you really believe that a free trade agreement is what is needed to reduce and eliminate hunger and poverty? Consider Burundi: the theoretical abolition of tariffs, as envisaged by the EPAs, would result in a gain for the European Union of a trade share equal to USD 12.4 million, which Burundi would lose, and that is after having calculated the gain to local consumers. This fact emerges from a study by the Economic Commission for Africa, a UN organisation, which also showed how that continent already has a rather high proportion of wealth owned by foreign residents, higher than any other region in the world: 39%. The idea that a further expansion of free-market ideas can produce wealth in these areas is also refuted by the data on subsidies. In Nigeria the cheapest meat is German and English and in Senegal 52 000 tonnes of onions exported in 2005 alone from the Netherlands placed farmers in very serious difficulties. The EPAs were originally conceived within the framework of the Cotonou agreement, which enshrines the fight against poverty and the struggle for social development, but they have instead become something which promotes not social development but rather greater poverty.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s approval by the United Nations represents a hugely important step forward. Up until now, a system of double standards has been in force. It is unacceptable that Russia has never been condemned for the odious conduct of its special forces in Chechnya. It is unacceptable that China has never been condemned for its tragic repression of the fundamental rights of the Tibetan people. It is unacceptable that the United States does not have to answer for its conduct in Iraq, where an occupation that is illegal in terms of international law has led to over 100 000 civilian victims. Furthermore, what can one say of Israel, which is taking illegal measures of collective punishment against the Palestinian people that are expressly forbidden by international conventions? Reason of state cannot be a justification for the negation of the rights of millions of men, women and children all over the world. The European Union must show greater courage on this issue: at stake are our credibility and our policy of promoting human rights. It is not enough to protest against countries that are unprotected by often dubious international alliances. Human rights are enshrined in codes: legal treaties apply to everyone, especially to the powerful. The coup de grâce
 for the credibility of the now defunct Commission on Human Rights in Geneva was dealt by the presence in that institution of governments that represent dictatorships and that have used their institutional position before the UN as a means of avoiding criticism of their policies and conduct. What right, for example, does the Sudanese Government have to participate in the Commission in Geneva, as is happening today? I therefore welcome all the reforms that have been announced to transform the Commission in Geneva into a restricted council on human rights. I applaud the news that has just reached us that the UN has approved the resolution of radical reforms to that institution despite opposition from the United States. I agree with the suggestions of the resolution we will approve tomorrow, especially when it states that only countries that demonstrate respect for fundamental rights may participate in the future council. We must also grant a more important role to international non-governmental organisations, which are truly democratic and independent, through the creation of a UN committee on NGOs, which needs to able to provide both encouragement and criticism for the UN system of human rights.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for ten years the European Union and the United States have been leading negotiations on China’s entry into the WTO. Now Beijing has learned the lesson and is not hesitating to apply the rules of the World Trade Organisation with a merciless resolution worthy of its masters. It appears that the anti-dumping measures in no way comply with Community legislation or case-law and may have an extremely negative impact on the whole system of EU trade policy and consumers: we should therefore conduct a wholesale rethink of the WTO’s laissez-faire doctrines. We believe that it is important for the European Union to retain an economic model that places at its centre respect for social clauses and the rights of workers in all parts of the world. Europe ought to be more active in the various international bodies to promote work with dignity. Europe ought to bring in regulations designed to promote labels for ascertaining geographical provenance and compliance with social and environmental rules. If we do not call into question the WTO’s laissez-faire policies, then after textiles and shoes will come a long list of other products.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the World Cup in Germany is an opportunity to tackle the issue of the exploitation of human beings. In my opinion, we need to support the initiatives put forward by the Commission in relation to women’s rights. I support the idea of launching an information and educational campaign designed to combat the phenomenon of sexual exploitation. Initiatives need to be undertaken at European level, including through the use of international instruments such as the Council of Europe Convention, but it is just as important to make a clear distinction between the world of forced prostitution and those who freely choose to work as prostitutes. There are, in fact, associations of female and male prostitutes; one such association came here to Parliament in order to call for the recognition of their profession, beginning with the introduction of a Charter of Rights and of a declaration of principles. There would appear to be a need, in political terms, to establish whether a woman who is not forced to prostitute herself should or should not be free to do so. Recognising voluntary prostitution and the laws governing a profession means recognising a series of rights and duties; among the rights – to mention a few – are those of living freely and safely, of carrying out one’s job free from slavery and of marrying, given that this is not permitted in some countries.

 Vittorio Agnoletto (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the human rights and democracy clause has a long history within Parliament and is based on the assumption that civil and political rights and, in a broader sense, economic, social and cultural rights as well need to be at the heart of European Union policy. The clause began in the early 1990s with the Lomé Agreement and in 1990 itself was also applied to Argentina. Every year, in its annual report, the European Parliament calls for this clause to be given greater weight and urges the Council to grant Parliament a more important role in overseeing its implementation. Parliament’s requests have so far not been met with a satisfactory response. The clause has now been included in over 50 agreements and applies to over 120 countries. In that respect, I must stress the importance of the Cotonou Agreement signed with the ACP countries in June 2000, which enhanced the role of this clause. The first point that I should like to address concerns the European Parliament. It has to give its assent before an agreement comes into force, but it is not called upon to give its opinion on initiating consultation or partly suspending an agreement. That lessens its institutional and, more generally, its political role. That is why I consider it important to emphasise that Parliament is no longer prepared to give its assent to new international agreements that do not contain a human rights and democracy clause. Parliament maintains that it has to play a part in defining the negotiating mandate for new agreements with third countries and, above all, in drafting their political and human rights objectives. In addition, Parliament asks to be involved in the decision-making process for initiating consultation or suspending an agreement, or indeed for suspending any appropriate negative measures that have already been imposed on a country. Lastly, Parliament asks to be associated with the Association Councils and their subcommittees on human rights and hopes that its interparliamentary delegations can play an enhanced role in that respect, by regularly including debates on the democracy clause on their meeting agendas. Another point that I should like to address concerns the reciprocity between the European Union and third countries, which so far has not been fully exploited. I also believe that the clause should be applied in relation to the violation under discussion and not in relation to the country under discussion. It is also necessary to extend the clause to all new agreements between the European Union and third countries, both industrialised and developing, including sectoral agreements and commercial, technical or financial aid, along the lines of what has been done for the ACP countries. Human rights issues need to be systematically included on Association Council agendas. To that end, we consider that the heads of the Commission’s external delegations in third countries must play an enhanced role and we call for country-by-country multiannual strategy documents to be drawn up and to be debated on a regular basis. A structured dialogue must be established between the Association Council and its subcommittee on human rights. We call for the general establishment of subcommittees on human rights, with a mandate to review compliance with and the application and implementation of the democracy clause, and to propose specific positive actions to improve democracy and human rights. It is important to underline that we call for these subcommittees to include and to consult representatives of parliaments and of organisations representing civil society. Then there is a further extremely important aspect. This resolution recognises that the need for unanimity within the Council in order to initiate a consultation procedure has made it more difficult to apply the clause. We therefore call for the abolition of this unanimity requirement and, in that respect, for the revision of Article 300(2) of the EC Treaty, which limits the role of the European Parliament in such cases. Lastly, while we believe that the clause should be applied to all countries and all agreements, we also think that, in the case of countries covered by the new neighbourhood policy, one might consider signing agreements that go beyond the democracy clause, based on the sharing of common institutions for promoting democratic principles and human rights, on the example of the Council of Europe and regional agreements.

 Mr President, the amendment is already in the Minutes, but I shall read it out again anyway.  ‘Points out that, in its relations with third countries and in the context of promoting democratic principles and human rights through the “democracy clause”, the European Union is called upon to pay special attention to implementing policies for gender equality and women’s rights, whilst satisfying itself that the third-country authorities uphold the fundamental rights not to be arbitrarily arrested, tortured or executed and that their citizens have access to an impartial court of law as a priority;’ (The oral amendment was accepted)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Martin Luther King said when launching the campaign for African-Americans’ rights, either we achieve freedom together or not at all. What he meant was that there are no black people’s rights or white people’s rights: there are just human rights. Fighting homophobia does not mean showing understanding towards a specific group in the population: first and foremost, it means upholding human rights. I am frightened by the arrogance of those who deny homosexuals the chance to give blood; I am frightened by the discriminatory campaigns of those who are unable to talk about high-risk behaviour yet still allude to high-risk individuals in the fight against AIDS; or those who ban people from driving just because they are gay. I cannot silently accept the attitude of a Commission that behaves like Pontius Pilate, in that it does not try to enforce a directive that already exists against discrimination; a Commission that ought to start infringement proceedings against countries that do not respect people’s freedom to choose their sexual orientation – that happens in Italy, Poland and a number of other countries. This is not an issue that just affects a particular group of people, but one that involves the dignity of the whole European Union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this was supposed to be called the development round, but frankly I think we can sum it up like this: the winner is the self-interest of the Northern countries of the world. The interests of US and European multinationals – effectively sponsored and represented by the work of the European Commission – have won yet again. How can one talk about demolishing protectionism or defending the free market when every one of the 25 000 cotton growers in the United States receives an average of USD 114 000 a year in subsidies? That results in a 15% cut in the price of cotton on the world market. The 20 million African growers are thus reduced to hunger: they include the peasants of Mali, Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Niger, all countries ranked at the bottom of the UN Human Development Index. How can one talk about development policy, when a policy based on the dumping of agricultural produce has been extended until 2013? The result of that is further destruction of the economies of developing countries, and we must not forget that 70% of the world’s population lives off the land. The European Union and the United States blamed each other, but in practice neither one is prepared to cut agricultural export subsidies on cotton straight away. That means continuing to create a monopoly system dominated by the agribusiness multinationals. We did not hear a single word about the need to include social clauses and to respect them: there was absolute silence on that topic. Not only that, but the developing countries have been forced to open their markets to industrial goods from the North, as they must cut their customs duties substantially. The result of that is unequal competition, which will further destroy what little industry has so far developed in Africa and the poorer regions of Asia. To the unthinking public, 97% may sound a lot. We know, however, that the problem will be the 3% of products that will not be allowed to freely access Northern hemisphere markets. In addition, the development aid promised has not been confirmed in precise figures, and it has not even been specified whether it will consist of actual aid or loans: it is pure window dressing that is being exposed for the sham that it really is. The services market is being opened up: education and social and health services will increasingly become less of a right and more of a commodity available only to those who can afford it. There is also the risk that even water may be included on this market as a commodity, one that in the near future will rival oil on the market. That is not to mention the situation of access to medicines, which are in practice denied to the 30 million people with HIV in Africa. I should like to know how one can talk of a development round when faced with such a reality.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is extremely important and useful mainly because it aims at making the code of conduct obligatory and calls for it to be legally recognised by all countries. Furthermore, I believe that calling for people to subscribe to the logic of marking and tracing weapons is important. The problem is that, if this code of conduct, which we debate each year, is not adopted by the Commission and by the Council, it is in danger of remaining merely a declaration of good intentions. It is extremely important that those instruments able to serve a dual purpose – both for peacekeeping and for making war – have also been included in this regulation. Finally, I believe that the decision to reaffirm the embargo on arms sales to China once more is equally important.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Vice-President Frattini reminds me – and this is not intended as an insult – of those famous monkeys which see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil. He has spoken, however, although he did not even have the courage to say that what is really at issue are not hidden jails in general, but genuine torture chambers made available to the CIA and the United States by some European countries. Commissioner Frattini, you are denying the obvious. You are denying something that even reliable US sources have admitted. We want you to conduct an investigation, but if there is no desire to find the evidence, the evidence will never be found. Commissioner, you are perhaps unaware that in Milan, on 17 February 2003, Abu Omar, the former Imam of the mosque in via Jenner, was kidnapped, and that the magistrates in Milan, having found incontrovertible proof that the CIA was directly responsible, have requested the extradition of 22 US intelligence agents. What stand did the Commission take when faced with this evidence? What did it actually do, in the light of this breach of sovereign rights, to force the US authorities to comply with the conventions on human rights and torture? The Commission did nothing. In the light of this experience, I am not optimistic about the results of any future action that the European Commission is likely to take.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the negotiations with Turkey start on 3 October, but Turkey must not be allowed to make a fool of the European Union: human rights must be at the heart of any talks. In contrast, constitutional reform has remained a mere aspiration and there is still the 10% barrier in electoral law that prevents the Kurds from having their own representatives in parliament. A new law restricts lawyers’ ability to carry out their professional duties; journalists can be arrested and their articles considered an attack on territorial integrity; teachers’ unions have been condemned for defending everybody’s right to speak their own language as well in school; and Mehmet Tarhan, a young Turkish gay, has been sentenced to several years in prison for claiming to be a conscientious objector. The situation is even worse in the Kurdistan region. Only a few weeks ago, Prime Minister Erdogan raised hopes that a peace process might begin, but nothing of the sort has happened. Although the Congra-Gel have declared the suspension of all military action, there are still reports of violent military action against the Kurdish population, together with torture and rape. The European Union must call on Turkey to politically acknowledge the existence of the Kurdish issue and to start public negotiations. The road to the European Union passes through Diyarbakir, the capital of Turkish Kurdistan. Human rights and respect for democratic rules are non-negotiable, yet the Turkish Government does not seem to have any intention of agreeing to the call from the European Court of Human Rights to grant Abdullah Ocalan a retrial. The European Union must not ignore that situation, unless it wants to undermine the credibility of that institution. The idea that Turkey can join the European Union without recognising Cyprus is utterly unacceptable: the ball is now in Turkey’s court. We can negotiate on economic and customs agreements for years, but never on human rights.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the answer seems very vague to me and puts off a decision sine die
. What we have here is a law that in practice regularises paramilitaries, offering organised criminals and drug traffickers the possibility of turning themselves into paramilitaries and thus taking advantage of this law. By the way, the law was also severely criticised by Amnesty International, which says that the demilitarisation and demobilisation have not actually taken place. I therefore call for an extremely specific answer on the matter of funding: does the European Union still intend to finance this kind of project, which formally aims at demobilisation, whereas in actual fact it ends up providing support for the paramilitary groups?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the approval of this regulation represents an important advance: today the majority of European minors take medicines whose effectiveness and safety has not been documented in children and adolescents, who are therefore exposed to greater risks than adults are. However, the implementation of the regulation will depend on the activities and responsibilities of the scientific committee which, while working within the EMEA, must retain its independence from the pharmaceutical industry in the interests of children. The proposed control activities of this committee should be made public, to enable all citizens to be aware and informed of what it is doing to improve their health. The implementation of the register of clinical and pharmacological experiments involving children and the creation of a European paediatric form, to be regularly updated, will also be important. In addition, in order to set up the MICE programme, envisaged by the regulation, it will be necessary to clarify the financing methods and how they interact with the EU’s framework programmes. The prolongation of a patent by six months is yet another gift to the pharmaceutical multinationals, in total disregard of the health of children and running counter to the objectives of this very regulation. The pharmaceutical industry is the industrial sector that in recent years has distributed the highest dividends to its shareholders, and it certainly has no need of even greater profits!

What I mean is that if accounts are not settled with the past, the past will sooner or later come back to haunt us, presenting us with a very expensive and dramatic bill. If we do not condemn the war today, it is not possible to understand what is happening in Iraq at the moment. The war and terrorism continue to feed off each other. Before the war in Iraq there was no terrorism. We have to have the courage to say that the occupying armies are an element producing insecurity and not security. We have to have the courage to say that the United States and its allies went into Iraq because there is oil there and because they wanted to get hold of it, and certainly not to spread democracy. Yesterday we met representatives of civil society, human rights organisations, trade unions and women’s organisations, who explained to us that this society is active and wants to have a say in its own future. Europe should look at this issue too, and not just at its relationship with a government voted in in elections that were held under foreign military occupation.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over and above the official statements, a change has been added to Article 2 allowing patent protection to also include the software contained in a computer. That opens the door to the patentability of software. It is as though it were possible one day to patent scales, notes and chords. It is as though the pentatonic scale were patented, as a result of which all of a sudden a large proportion of blues music would be in violation of such a patent and all writers would have to pay royalties to whomever had registered it. Patents have already been requested for ideas that are not new, such as the mouse click to carry out a command or the inequality operator in open source software, and for other unoriginal ideas that are today used in practically every software package in circulation. Furthermore, if interoperability were to be obstructed by patents on programs and consumers were forced in all cases to only purchase and use products made by the same company, there would be huge consequences, mainly of an economic nature. No company must be able to build a monopoly through patented software. A small business would find itself having to sustain enormous expenses, on the one hand in order not to carry out any violation of the patent, and, on the other hand, to defend its own actions in court. Competition would therefore no longer just be a market issue, but would also become a legal issue. Let us think about all of the university and hospital research institutes that today, thanks to the absence of this directive, carry out research by saving on software because they use programs devised by the institutes themselves, and which are therefore free of charge, or alternative software costing much less than Microsoft products. Without patents on software, Europe could keep costs low, stimulate innovation, improve security and create employment. To the title of the Harvard Business Review
 ‘Patents are smart bombs’, I would add ‘against the prospect of enabling the future interaction of different cultures and worlds’.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that the Council report, the Commission report and also the motion put forward by the majority of the political Groups are all aimed at seeking agreement with the United States at any cost, even by removing principles that have always underpinned the foundations of the European Union. I am talking about respect for human rights, for instance: the Guantanamo affair is not an isolated case, as demonstrated, for example, by the Abu Ghraib situation – which absolutely no one has mentioned – and the kidnapping of free citizens, as documented by the major European newspapers, which was carried out by the US Secret Service on European Union soil. We do not see anything and we do not say anything at all on the matter. There is also no mention of condemning preventative war, which is completely at odds with international law. Building transatlantic relations is achieved, moreover, by continually paying tribute to all forms of liberalism, and even – I heard it said by the Commission representative – by proposing to put services on the market of transatlantic relations, which up to now – fortunately – have been excluded from International Trade Organisation agreements and are still considered to be services for accessing rights, and not goods for generating profits.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to return in particular to one of the topics mentioned: the issue of AIDS and HIV. On 2 December 2004, this House voted in favour of a very precise resolution and called for the involvement of the Commission and the Council, with the particular aim of amending the existing TRIPS rules, which are one of the fundamental factors preventing adults and children living in the southern countries of the world from having access to medicines. As far as I am aware, nothing has been done in this specific area, that is, amending the TRIPS rules, and I should like to ask the reason for this, partly because the situation has lately become even more tragic with the TRIPS rules being adopted by the Indian Government.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am truly astonished to hear in this House that the WTO is the vehicle for improving and promoting fair, inclusive trade. How can such an idea be asserted? We only have to look at the tangible results of the rounds of negotiations that have been and are still being held. How can we talk about reciprocity between a giant and a dwarf, between David and Goliath? How can we hope for developing countries to be the winners of this round if we do not change our policies? Why do we not enter into the merits of the results? Why is there no mention of how subsidies given to 25 000 cotton growers in the United States have reduced millions of people to starvation in Central Africa? Why is there no mention of how TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) have deprived and continue to deprive 30 million people – the great majority in Africa – of anti-AIDS drugs, and of how the enforcement of TRIPS in India has halved the number of people in the developing world who have access to anti-AIDS drugs? Why is there no mention of the disaster caused by the subsidies for intensive agriculture paid out by Europe and the United States? At the Cancun Ministerial Conference, that disaster united Brazil, India and the countries in the South against Europe and the United States. Furthermore, what preparations are we making for the next WTO Ministerial Conference to be held in Hong Kong? The impression is that we will succeed in liberalising the social services and health services, in the name of an economic liberalism that will quite simply end up making those services fee-based – and controlled by large multinationals – in the countries in the South, denying access to a large proportion of the population. Why is no mention made of the Economic Partnership Agreements? We have discussed them and we have seen their tragic result in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly held at Bamako. Through the appeal for complete liberalisation of trade with countries in the South – particularly Africa – and the abolition of import duties in those countries, such agreements contributed to destroying their economies, denying them the opportunity to autonomously choose their own strategies for a different kind of development. In contrast, I believe that we should fight for a reduction in the role of the World Trade Organisation. We should fight to ensure that a whole range of goods can come under the management of other agencies, such as United Nations agencies for instance, starting with agricultural and pharmaceutical products. For these reasons, our group expresses its entirely negative opinion on the report presented to this House.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the world in which we live nearly 700 million weapons are in circulation and a further eight million are produced each year. Businesses are manufacturing them, brokers are putting them on sale, governments and individuals are buying and selling them and people are dying: at the rate of one a minute. With those words Amnesty International has recently launched the Marking and Tracing project, a treaty under which States undertake to adopt measures for identifying all weapons and ammunition with a serial number that cannot be falsified nor destroyed. This represents a necessary step in preventing the illegal trade in arms. For as long as arms remain unidentifiable, States and businesses will always deny responsibility for them. The European Union should actively support this campaign. From 1999 to 2003, Italy, for instance, as the second most important small arms manufacturer in the world and the first at European level, sold, in defiance of legislative decrees, EUR 36 million of arms to countries involved in armed conflicts, EUR 3.6 million to nations under embargo and EUR 128 million to countries condemned for human rights violations. On the other hand, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council control 88% of the global market in arms. For all of these reasons, it is essential that the European Union adopts the treaty on arms brokering drafted by a group of NGOs and Nobel prize winners, and launches a convention on arms brokers that, inter alia
, makes any activity with the aim of transferring arms between third parties subject to state authorisation. The European Union must improve its code of conduct on the transfer of arms, clarifying the circumstances in which it is possible to refuse an authorisation to export arms, extending checks to all military equipment, forcing individual States to bring in legislation in compliance with the code of conduct and to publish an annual report on their respective arms exports. We cannot forget that it is precisely small arms that are responsible for nearly the entire sum of deaths in conflicts taking place across our world.

Mr President, whilst I acknowledge the very substantial efforts made by Mr Coveney I must, unfortunately, add that the results fall well short of expectations. It is, in reality, an extensive report, full of statements with which we can agree, which are simplistic at times and marked by a certain desire to please. At the same time, however, the report is very careful – and on this point I disagree with Mr van Hecke – to avoid disgruntling the European Union’s economic and political partners. It can be argued that this report is very weak towards the strong and, all too often, very negligent towards the weak. Many examples can be cited: no mention is made of the tragic situation of the Kurdish population in Turkey, which is yet to join the European Union and thus should have been included in such a document. There is an unwillingness, however, to upset relations with Turkey. With regard to Iraq, there is a reluctance to single out US responsibility in the treatment of prisoners: virtually nothing is said on the subject of Abu Ghraib. Regarding Colombia, again no criticism is made of the role of the government and its relationship with the paramilitary forces. The Israeli Government is asked to stop building the wall, but is not explicitly denounced for it. Aside from that, no reference whatsoever is made to the lack of respect for freedom of information in Algeria. I would therefore say that, in some ways, this document has not made the best of the opportunity presented and that, if it remains in its current state, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left will not be able to lend their support to it.

Mr President, whilst we are discussing an extremely important resolution, which will be put to the vote tomorrow, news arrived a few hours ago that, yesterday, in the province of Naples, a cabin in a Roma camp caught fire, resulting in the death of a young boy and the discovery of his father and another young boy in a serious condition. A delegation of Roma from several Italian cities – who have been here for two days to meet Members and increase awareness among them – told me the news as soon as they heard it: they were saddened but stated that, unfortunately, such events continue to occur. Where do they occur? In Italy, in the heart of Old Europe, where these people – the majority of whom have not been Travellers for some time – are concentrated in camps without water, electricity or services. One of them said today, ‘The first time I ever slept in a container was when I arrived in Italy; I had a house where I came from.’ The rights of the European Union end at the edges of the Travellers’ camps, and the Italian Government continues to rid itself – that is the term to use – of the Roma population through collective expulsions. In such a situation it is impossible to educate the children and to make them attend school. There are young people 20 years old who were born in Italy and who do not have an Italian identity card. Recently, other children born in Italy have been considered to have a Yugoslav nationality, without knowing which one, as it no longer even exists. Many Roma citizens residing in my country have an identity card – when they do have one – that bears the address of the Travellers’ camp and, in parentheses, ‘Roma Camp’. It is obvious that they will not succeed in finding work and that they will be increasingly discriminated against, when they are in that situation. I will conclude by saying that tomorrow’s vote is extremely important, but that it will be all the more so if it is put into practice, particularly by the European Commission. Let us not forget that the commissioner who should be attending to this issue is an Italian, Mr Frattini, although in my view he is very much like the monkey that used to say ‘See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.’

Mr President, I should simply like to draw the attention of the House to a very serious matter: 40 Kurdish citizens have reached their 30th day on hunger strike because they are appealing to be allowed to stay in Belgium, on the grounds of a request for political asylum. Some of these people are in an extremely serious condition. I have sent an open letter to the Ministry of the Interior asking it to provide subsidiary protection which, partly through the third European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights of 15 December 1980, could allow these people to remain in Belgium for the time being, even without political asylum. A delegation from Parliament will be going to the Eglise des Minimes 
tomorrow at 9.30 to show their solidarity with these 40 Kurds who are risking their lives.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find the Kuhne report extremely worrying and dangerous, because it does not recognise the primacy of the United Nations and international law in European security and defence policy. The report places the UN on the same level as NATO and other organisations and institutions, clears the way for approval of the theory of preventive military intervention, which violates international law, and lumps military intervention together with humanitarian action, implicitly relegating humanitarian development aid to a functional role subordinated to military and security policies. It also claims that NATO and the European Union are complementary, ignoring the subordinate role of the European Union within NATO and the need to promote an independent and non-aggressive European foreign policy. Lastly, it fails to say that the application of international law and UN resolutions and the end of military occupations are the only conditions for a fair and lasting peace in the Middle East. EU support for non-proliferation should also include calling on Israel to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regarding the need to make the work of the police more transparent within the European Union, I should like to draw attention to one specific aspect. I wish to underline the importance for this Parliament of calling on the Council of the European Union to make the European Code of Police Ethics binding. This code was adopted by the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers on 19 September 2001 and ought to be considered the starting point for developing professional standards for the police in the European Union. Making the code law in the countries of Europe would represent an important contribution to the development of a European body of law more in keeping with international human rights and those national legislations that are more advanced concerning police matters. In terms of the Union’s internal policy, turning the code into a binding legal act would, owing to the provisions it contains regarding training in ethics for police officers, have an important preventive and safeguarding function, so that – Mr Frattini knows what I am talking about – serious violations of human rights such as those committed by the Italian police in Genoa during the G8 Summit in 2001 will not happen again. In terms of external relations, adoption of the code would give the European Union greater international credibility. Respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law in third countries is an essential factor for the EU in developing external relations and concluding international treaties.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nuclear proliferation in North Korea is a source of great concern. We are dealing with a country which has concealed its production of nuclear weapons from the international community. These arsenals therefore have to be dismantled and North Korea must sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty at once and allow IAEA inspectors from Vienna to carry out the appropriate inspections. However, we believe that the diplomatic route is the only viable one in that region. North Korea must return to the negotiating table for the six-party talks with the USA, South Korea, Japan, Russia and China. Against this backdrop, aggressive statements from Washington are not helpful. Instead of the Bush administration’s recent sabre-rattling, I believe North Korea should be offered a political and diplomatic agreement as a quid pro quo
 for monitoring of its nuclear arsenal. Moreover, I believe that when debating nuclear weapons, we cannot avoid the issue of who should cast the first stone. For example, we cannot avoid emphasising the recent revelation in Italy that, in certain NATO bases on Italian soil, nuclear weapons belonging to the US are being stockpiled, unknown to residents in the vicinity. In my view, therefore, the issue of nuclear disarmament is everyone’s business and does not merely concern the two countries now under discussion.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that, after this discussion, the Commissioner will not think he has given everyone a hearing and can proceed along the same course as before, as he seems to have been saying during the debate over the last few months. I refer to both questions, services and software. With particular regard to software, the decision taken yesterday is a serious affront to the democratic wishes of European citizens. Instead of referring the text back to Parliament, the body you represent opted to submit the directive for approval by the Council, completely ignoring the opinion of the European Parliament, whose intention was to have the legislative process re-started from scratch. I believe the directive lacks a clear legal framework and runs the risk of allowing the large IT multinationals to patent not only the software used in industrial applications but also other types of computer program, thereby seriously restricting the use of technological innovations in this area. It should be clearly understood that this method of interinstitutional cooperation, which ignores the views of the European Parliament, the only institution elected democratically by universal suffrage, is not democratic and does not represent the wishes expressed by millions of European citizens.

 Mr President, in your opening speech you recalled the death of Nicola Calipari, but I would rather call it the murder of Nicola Calipari. A statement by Mr Barroso was put out a few minutes ago, in which he describes what happened as an unfortunate incident. I do not know whether the Commission has any information that has not yet been made public which enables him to state that it was an unfortunate incident and not something more serious. About an hour ago, CNN, referring to Pentagon sources, leaked the conclusion reached by the US inquiry, which is that it was simply a misunderstanding between the Italian and US authorities over the communication that the vehicles would be going past. I should like to endorse the demand by Reporters Without Borders for a United Nations inquiry to be set up, and I call on the Commission and the Council to support their demand. In addition, I request that this issue should be included in the debate within the European Union on transatlantic relations, since we, as the European Union, have a very specific responsibility.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my appreciation of the full and accurate report. I nevertheless seem to detect a kind of reverence and a respectful distance – which I also felt during the speeches given by the Commission and the Council – when certain powerful quarters are named, when it is they who are responsible for the failure to uphold human rights. In particular, with reference to Iraq, injustices and violence must be condemned with equal force whatever their origin, whether terrorists or the occupying Anglo-American forces are involved. If prison conditions really were the measure of a society’s level of civilisation, then the West would be in a terrible state in view of situations such as Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo. In this case it is not enough to ask the United States to clarify the situation. Here there is nothing to clarify but we have a political and moral duty to voice a firm condemnation. I also believe that in Afghanistan too, infringements of human rights should be condemned, including when they are carried out by international forces. Moreover, the United States should be called on to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The law must be equal for all and no one must have any kind of international immunity. We recently voted to start negotiations with Turkey, and thereby contracted a debt which we must honour: namely, to continue monitoring, day after day, how the situation develops – not just in the legislative field but also in everyday policy – with regard to respect for human rights, in particular those of the Kurdish population, political recognition and a commitment to finding a solution to this conflict, and also recognition of the Republic of Cyprus and withdrawal of troops from the northern part of the island. These issues must be explicitly set out in the report. Human rights must also be interpreted in a broader sense: we cannot only condemn violence and the death penalty when individuals are concerned, while overlooking entire political decisions that condemn millions of people to death. I refer to the liberalist economic and financial policies which force, for example, 800 million people to live on less than a dollar a day and deny tens of millions of people access to treatment for AIDS. In the Amazon, where 20% of the entire planet’s freshwater flows every day, tens of thousands of people in Manaus have no access to drinking water because the service has been privatised. That is an example of how our model of development violates the most important human right, that is, the right to existence.

 Mr President, I have the impression that the media spotlight on the tragedy in the Far East has not yet been turned off and already the emphatic declarations of solidarity are giving way to more cynical economic and geopolitical interests. Mr Barroso has tried to carry out a sleight of hand, but he is not a good conjurer. The word ‘reprogramming’ means using funds that had already been allocated to aid, and so I call for all the EUR 350 million for the first stage of reconstruction to be a new appropriation and for the total of EUR 1.5 billion that is to be paid out by the European Union and the 25 Member States to be donated without any kind of interest. I have heard calls in this Chamber to take account of the foreign debt of the countries affected by the tsunami. I believe we should state clearly that the only practicable possibility is to cancel their foreign debt. We are talking about countries like Indonesia, which has more than USD 130 billion in debts and repaid USD 13 billion in 2002. Given figures like those, our donations cannot provide any practical aid unless we cancel the debt. I have not yet heard anybody mention an attempt to change the immigration rules, at least temporarily: I refer to the possibility for immigrants from the affected nations who are already living in Europe to be able to return home, see the situation for themselves, look for their loved ones and then be able to come back to the Union, without running the risk of losing their residence permit or job. I also refer to the possibility of offering residence permits, at least temporary ones, to all those who have been hurt during this tragedy. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, across the world prohibitionism has always produced two results: on the one hand, a large increase in the number of deaths and imprisonments among those who use narcotics, who inter alia
 constitute the section of the prison population with the highest re-offending rate, and on the other hand unlimited big business for all sorts of drug traffickers. This plan, however, focuses mainly on protecting everyone’s health. This is why the harm reduction strategies are absolutely fundamental. Only by keeping alive persons who currently cannot or do not want to stop using narcotic substances can we hope that in the future they will succeed in escaping from all forms of dependence. We must not forget that most deaths are due to AIDS and heart failures, that is, pathological situations connected with drug-taking methods. For this reason, harm reduction involves taking action on the street and at low-threshold centres. In addition, we must firmly distinguish between drug dealers and drug users, although repressive policies tend to place them in the same category. Finally, it is essential to integrate social measures and pharmacological substitution measures. We must avoid any kind of moralistic attitude that sets these in opposition.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the Council will set an exact date for the start of negotiations, in the knowledge that that date will mark the beginning of a long journey, the outcome of which will largely depend on the additional transformations that take place in Turkey during that time. We must reject all forms of racism from those who are trying to make religion a basis for discrimination. The coexistence of religions and cultures is the only future for a democratic and multiethnic Europe. A solution to the Cyprus issue, full respect for human rights and political acknowledgement of the ongoing conflict in Kurdistan, as well as a commitment to finding a peaceful solution and an immediate, and obviously bilateral, cessation of hostilities should all be at the core of the negotiations with Turkey. We have actually been asked to start the negotiations by the Kurdish democratic organisations and the human rights associations in Turkey – which are still suffering on a daily basis and are witnessing terrible injustices – so that they can involve the whole of Europe in their battle for democracy and respect for human rights. In fact, while we acknowledge the changes that have been made so far to the constitution and the criminal code, there can be no doubt that they are not enough. There is still a great deal to do, such as cutting back the power of the army, which must be brought under the control of the executive and legislative powers, amending electoral law and allowing the Kurdish language to be spoken in official proceedings.

 The scenario that has been illustrated here is not just the result of a natural disaster but represents a tragic synthesis between an aggressive virus and the unbridled drive for profit by single-minded, powerful organisations like the multinational pharmaceutical companies. While 95% of HIV-positive people in the world already have no access to treatment today, the situation is bound to get even worse after 1 January 2005, when the derogation from Article 31 of the TRIPS agreement expires. India, with a billion inhabitants, and other developing countries will then no longer be able to produce the drugs. Even now, those who produce them cannot sell them to other developing countries or to African countries. The European Union therefore needs to go beyond all the talking and the statements of principle and make every effort above all to obtain a further derogation from the TRIPS agreement, pending a complete change to it. Not only that: the European Union must also oppose the US practice of holding developing countries to ransom in their bilateral agreements, with the aim of preventing them from exercising their right, laid down in the Doha declarations, to use or import generic drugs. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS must be supported with an increase in the funds allocated to it. I propose that, on the part of the European Union at least, they should reach EUR 1 billion and that everyone, including Italy, should abide by the commitments that have been made. According to Fortune, the average salary of the top nine pharmaceutical company directors in the world is USD 42 million a year. At the same time, tens of millions of people die without being able to receive treatment. In the face of such injustice, any kind of moralistic argument should be thrown out. We should remember that a condom is something very useful: a health aid that should be distributed absolutely free of charge. It is part of the toolkit needed to defeat the virus.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a great risk that this debate will become an annual ritual, in which we declare ourselves more or less of one mind, but all that remains afterwards is a list of good intentions and recommendations to the Commission and the Council. In order to avoid this it is absolutely necessary that the Code of Conduct should become legally binding and that we set out strict sanctions against businesses registered in the European Union which do not respect it. It is also essential for the Union to commit itself to demanding that other countries, such as the United States, Russia and China, adhere to the Code of Conduct, in view of the fact, as well, that over 50% of world arms manufacturing takes place in countries that are members of the UN Security Council. As we speak, my country, Italy, has increased its arms exports by 25% in one year and is forecasting a 40% increase in future. Among the greatest beneficiaries of the Italian arms trade is Saudi Arabia, which is certainly not an example of a country that is respectful of rights. I believe that we certainly must maintain the embargo on arms sales to China, and, moreover, that the protection of human rights must take absolute priority over the economic interests of profit. One final observation: last year, world military spending equalled 900 billion dollars, 700 billion dollars of which was spent in the civilised countries of the first world alone. That is not the kind of civilisation that we want!

 Mr President, I should like to bring an extremely serious event to Parliament’s attention. On Thursday, 7 October, the FBI, acting on federal orders, asked Rack Space, a US service provider, to hand over to them the hardware of two servers hosting all of Indymedia’s material, in other words the material from dozens of locations in this international network, which works with non-profit-making groups and associations. All the material was handed over without Indymedia even being able to find out the reasons for this action, which was a real act of censorship. I believe the European Parliament should always stand up for anyone’s area of freedom of expression and debate. I therefore call for the clampdown on Indymedia to be lifted and for the reasons behind it to be queried, at least.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is clear that the primary objective of all of us here is to do everything possible to save all the hostages – French, Italian and Iraqi alike – because all lives are equally valuable. To achieve this, however, generic words and statements are not enough. Who in Europe does not want the hostages freed? I wonder, however, how we can dare to rightly ask for people to respect human rights and to save the hostages’ lives when the armies of countries sitting in this Chamber then continue to drop bombs and kill civilians. We take up the NGO’s plea and call for the bombing to stop. Terrorism and war are mirror images and feed off each other. They are the real enemies of pacifism and of the solidarity that is working in Iraq to build a new society. We do not know who has carried out these kidnappings, but we do know there are various interests that want the NGOs to leave Iraq and not witness the violations of rights that are happening everywhere. I did not hear the Council make any condemnation of the war, a pre-emptive war that has trampled on centuries of human rights. We demand the immediate withdrawal of the troops and announce that, if our amendments against the war and for the withdrawal of the troops are not accepted, we shall vote against the draft resolution to be tabled tomorrow. We remain in tune with the major movements and with public opinion, which is standing firm against the war and against terrorism with no ifs or buts. (Applause)
