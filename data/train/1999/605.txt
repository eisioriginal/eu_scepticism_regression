 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Stability Pact is dead. It could be regretted that it was destroyed by the European Council, in relation to the specific difficulties of two large countries, thus violating the credibility of the institutions based on a system of rules accepted by all. However, as far as its form is concerned, this Pact has always been the subject of an intergovernmental agreement rather than control by our Parliament, the only representative of the sovereignty of the people of Europe. What ‘intergovernmentality’ has done, Mr Karas, is ruin it. Federalists and Greens will not lament the death of this Pact – a Pact that President Prodi himself yesterday described as stupid – particularly as since the Amsterdam summit we had criticised its content. It was indeed stupid, doubly so in fact. In the current situation, it aggravates the recessions by penalising the countries that are seeking to support the actual demand on the Union’s internal market, especially in the large countries with a particular responsibility from this point of view. Instead, it would be better to penalise the countries that have deficits in periods of growth. From a structural point of view, a genuine Stability Pact should shelter future investments and in particular the enormous investments required to respect the Kyoto criteria. There is no time left to dither now. A new, intelligent pact must be adopted. Only a pact of this nature will merit inclusion in the third part of the Constitution. Indeed, only an intelligent Constitution will merit the approval and respect of the citizens of Europe. The pact must be contra-cyclic and, at the same time, must not hinder the countries in difficulty. On the contrary, it must penalise the countries that abuse their facilities and in this way, through a sort of climatic golden rule, shelter future investments from the current situation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the death of Louis XIV, King of France, the French people showered their devotion on his successor, Louis XV. We too wish to shower our devotion on Mr Trichet and will be voting for him, although there are no more objective reasons for supporting him than there were for feeling devotion in advance for Louis XV. The main reason behind our enthusiasm for Mr Trichet is the lethargy of his predecessor. Mr Trichet will tell us that, throughout his mandate as vice-president, although it was his task to provide secondary support for the European Union’s objectives – the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, which are full employment and sustainable development – he personally considered that pursuing the first objective: price stability, would be support enough. Consequently, during the three and a half years of his mandate, whilst achieving the same rate of inflation as the United States, we have done infinitely less well than the Americans in the field of investment and stability. I hope that Mr Trichet will not say: ‘this could last as long as I do, after me, the deluge’.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us be clear about this, the Alstom affair, in its European dimension, is first of all a matter of form. The Commission was perfectly right to sanction the French Government for the arrogance and contempt for the common rules which it has demonstrated in this affair. This incident is only part of a long series of incidents. The way in which Mr Raffarin’s government openly flouted the provisions of the Stability Pact, even though President Chirac had been one of its initiators and unconditional supporters, will make it difficult to renegotiate that pact, something that even Mr Prodi himself describes as stupid. There are other examples, such as the Raffarin government’s contempt for the Directive on the conservation of wild birds and the Natura 2000 Directive, which resulted in the massacre in the wetlands of Poitou. The icing on the cake is Mr Raffarin’s statement in which he talks about the legal requirements for the executive authority of the European Union as if it were some office in a foreign country. For this shameful statement I should like, on behalf of the great majority of French people who are aware of the fact that Europe is not a foreign country but rather our joint home, to offer our apologies to the Commission. Agreement has been reached today, and in this I rejoice. It will make it possible to save Alstom from imminent bankruptcy, something for which the directors, and those of ABB, are entirely responsible, despite warnings from their union members. It will give the French Government and the Commission time to negotiate formally a final solution. Having said that, Competition Commissioner, I should like to say a few words about the substance of this affair. You are aware that our group, the Greens, has loyally supported your efforts to defend consumers against the abusive practices of monopolies. My report on competition in 2001 bears witness to that fact. Nevertheless, I made certain observations which we have discussed in detail face to face, not only between Commissioner and MEP, but also between one economist and another. The Alstom affair once again gives me the opportunity to tell you this. Consumer protection consists, first of all, in guaranteeing consumers the existence of the supply of goods or services, before even thinking about the price of those goods or services. In other words it consists in implementing an industrial policy. The disappearance of Alstom, which would have caused the collapse of Asean Brown Boveri, would have greatly reduced the European supply of electricity turbines and high-speed trains, just at the time when the climate crisis and the Kyoto Agreement are calling for enormous investment in these two areas. Then again, what applies in the case of network infrastructures, where economic theory shows that monopolies and public subsidies are sometimes preferable to pure competition, often applies, ipso facto
, to the oligopoly which is responsible for constructing and maintaining those networks. Finally, the brutal way in which the Raffarin Government was put in its place was perceived by the employees and the people who live in the regions concerned as a piece of brutality and inhumanity directed against them personally by a Europe which is once again being experienced as a foreign and hostile institution. In the final analysis the position of the Raffarin Government means privatising profits and nationalising losses. I do not approve of that and neither do you. You need to be able to demonstrate that European competition policy is aimed at keeping excessive profits in check and promoting the supply of public goods.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many of you have heard of Ingrid Betancourt, representative of Colombia’s Green Party, whose relatives have visited this House on several occasions. It is now a year and a half since she was kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The position of the family and the Colombian Green Party, as well as the European Parliament’s Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, has been to encourage a humanitarian exchange, whilst criticising FARC and saying that it is unacceptable to propose a political exchange. Yesterday, the Colombian press received a cassette containing a threefold message from Ingrid Betancourt: firstly, if you want to mount a military operation in order to set me free then go ahead, but be careful! Secondly, humanitarian exchanges can only take place between armies and thirdly, as far as we are concerned – we, the politicians who have been kidnapped – only FARC can give us an unconditional release. I believe that this message, surprising as it is, can be explained both by the extreme courage of Ingrid Betancourt on the one hand, who does not hesitate to take risks in the name of her political principles and, on the other, by FARC’s desire to show that they are prepared to allow their prisoner to appeal to public opinion, even if only to say ‘attack us!’ What I would ask, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, is that we give firm support to Ingrid Betancourt’s third proposal, which is to clearly ask FARC to release all their political prisoners unilaterally, because it is unacceptable to take negotiators or representatives of the people hostage.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Commissioner Barnier said, it is important that the Union confirms its solidarity with the countries whose forestry resources and agricultural productions have been affected. In view of this, it would be a very serious mistake to reduce the environmental disaster of this summer to the economic losses it involved. It is, first and foremost, a huge humanitarian disaster, equivalent for the whole of Europe to 10 times the scale of the attacks of 11 September. In effect, it is the first major disaster which is both economic and humanitarian caused by the climate shift in the temperate zone. This climate shift has coincided with another equally disastrous trend: the increasing isolation of a section of the population which is also increasingly dependent because it is elderly. I will leave my colleagues from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance the task of expounding on the absolute priorities resulting from this shameful experience, from this condemnation of our development model: the need to speed up Kyoto, the rejection of an endeavour to boost the economy based on a motorway programme, the discrediting of the nuclear sector as an alternative for fossil energies, the obligation to adapt our flora and our habitat to the changes which have already occurred. However, it is just as important to adapt our health system and our social security networks to protect our elderly people against climate shocks. The loosening of family ties, including the links of geographic proximity, due to the individualisation of our societies and growing mobility, is a largely irreversible phenomenon which is not wholly negative. Our elderly people, we, ourselves, in the future, will be able to cope with the situation provided that services of general interest are developed to offset it, both in the public sector and in the third sector, the associative and cooperative sector. Is the fact that France has been particularly affected not due first and foremost to the fact that, for two years, grants to the associations managing old people’s homes have been halved, in the same way as care allowance has been cut? That is why we are calling upon the Commission to draw up a Green Paper on the protection of elderly people and combating climate and, more generally, health risks, on the basis of European best practice.

 – (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have to recognise that there are a number of reports on broadly the same subject. This being the case, we will not support the report drafted by Mr Trentin, whom I greatly admire. We will consider instead Mr García-Margallo y Marfil’s report. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is faced with a real operational problem. When a rapporteur from the left and a rapporteur from the right decide to address the same issue, the report from the left is pulled to pieces by honourable Members on the right. With a bit of luck, the report is approved when it is put forward by a rapporteur from the right. We must therefore recognise that the García-Margallo y Marfil report is much better and much more useful than Mr Trentin’s, now that it has been cut to ribbons by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Be that as it may, I have long acknowledged that Mr García-Margallo y Marfil has demonstrated considerable qualities in his role as a rapporteur. As Mr Langen said, the Trentin report is clearly not actually a report drawn up by Mr Trentin. Mr Trentin’s speech almost entirely contradicted the contents of his report. I will therefore only comment on the contents of the García Margallo y Marfil report, in its present form. It is my belief that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance support all the objectives and comments on the subject as included in the García-Margallo y Marfil report. It has the virtue of bringing the objectives of economic policy back into line with the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives. We want to ensure that Europe is a model of economic growth. Growth should be based on high-quality investment in human resources, high-calibre public investment and on the use of environmentally-sustainable technologies. Given the size of the continent of Europe, which has one of the highest population concentrations in the world, it is my belief that this is the only way forward for the European Union. The García-Margallo y Marfil report does contain discrepancies. It is forced to juggle the fact that the Stability and Growth Pact must be welcomed, while also acknowledging the need to finance investments. It acknowledges that the article in the Treaty of Maastricht which prevents European institutions from criticising the European Central Bank must not be undermined, while also stating that it is nonetheless necessary to provide credit at special rates for the required investments. It mentions taxation, not interest rates. In short, the report tends to skirt round the real problems of institutional impasse we are currently experiencing within the European Union. Next year these problems will catapult us back into the situation of so-called europaralysis we experienced during the dark years of working towards the euro from 1990 to 1997. As we cannot control the interest rates fixed by the European Central Bank, interest rates will be too high. This will present problems for Member States wishing both to invest and pay off their debts. These excessive interest rates will also make the euro too strong. It will hamper exports at a time of global recession. Unless we resolve to tackle the Stability and Growth Pact as it currently stands, we will be unable to finance the investments Mr García-Margallo y Marfil calls for.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will vote in favour of the proposal of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left calling for the common position to be rejected. We are not supporting this proposal because we wish to oppose the financing of supplementary pensions through accumulation of capital on principle. As Mr Kuckelkorn said, a pension is a pension. It is not a form of saving. Pensions are for life. They provide for workers when they retire. They also offer certain guarantees in case of incapacity. Reversion pensions provide for surviving spouses. Pensions are not financial products. It is quite possible that certain financial products and financial institutions may contribute to the management of certain pension schemes. Beyond this, however, we would be embarking on the search to establish European definitions of pension products and social mechanisms for the first time. We also need to consider in what circumstances financial institutions can make a contribution. At present, we are just dressing up savings products in a very ill-defined way. I would like to thank Mr Karas for all the efforts he has made to make this dressing-up as convincing as possible. Savings products have been dressed up to resemble pensions. With Mr Karas’ amendments, they were already far from being pensions. The compromise amendments, however, have made everything quite clear. They are purely and simply savings products and should be treated as such. It would amount to a violation of trading regulations to sell them as pensions.

 Mr President, I can only congratulate you on the decision you have finally taken on the Stability and Growth Pact included in the Treaty of Amsterdam. I agree it was stupid to set in advance the date by which all the Member States simultaneously had to achieve a balanced budget. The budget deficit is a part of the economic policy, the short-term economic policy. What is more, it is the only part remaining after the European Central Bank’s display of irresponsibility. The level of deficit should, therefore, depend solely on the prevailing situation on a given date. I agree it was stupid to set the same margin for manoeuvre – 3% – for all countries, as some are already in a great deal of debt, while others are not. Some only contribute marginally to European aggregate data, while others are the driving force of the common market. So why did the Amsterdam negotiators, who were not stupid either, adopt a stupid rule? And, first of all, was a rule necessary? Unlike the French Minister for the Economy, Mr Mer, I do not think a country can ignore its commitments on the pretext that it has other priorities, in this case, reducing taxes for the rich. I agree we need rules that apply to all the countries of our Europe. If we want intelligent, flexible rules, however, a common economic authority must be able to take decisions according to the common situation. It is the short-sightedness of the Amsterdam negotiators, their rejection of a true federal Europe which led them to adopt a stupid rule, setting the same deficit limits, the same deadline for compliance, in advance, for all Member States. May your positive intervention, Mr President, convince the Convention, the European Council and Europe as a whole to choose intelligence over stupidity, to opt for a federal constitution.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the joint resolution on Mercosur – which we support – is a balanced reflection of the European Union’s concerns regarding the extremely serious crisis affecting Mercosur and which threatens to affect the Andean Community of Nations. The resolution firmly expresses the solidarity that the Europeans share with the peoples with whom we have so many historical ties through friendship and even family. Unfortunately, this solidarity is not expressed by means of a co-ordinated position of the Member States in the international financial institutions, which are in fact largely responsible for the disaster in Argentina, as a former IMF Chief Economist, Professor Stieglitz, demonstrated so well. The resolution quite rightly calls for our policies to be co-ordinated in order to provide financial aid to the Mercosur countries and to include these new guidelines in the EU-Mercosur agreement that is currently being negotiated. These negotiations also cover external debt, the ethical position of businesses and the European banks. So, there are many good resolutions, and yet the issue remains and will without a shadow of a doubt be raised in the US: does Europe really wish to save South America? In order to calm the fears of our Mercosur partners, we must listen to their demands and dot the i’s and cross the t’s. Hence the three amendments that we tabled to our own resolution: firstly, the very clear rejection of financial conditions which would further exacerbate the poverty of the Mercosur peoples, such as lowering salaries or making cuts in public services. Secondly, Europe’s renunciation of its subsidies for agricultural dumping for exports that are largely responsible for Mercosur’s difficulties, and lastly, the creation of a bilateral citizen’s committee so that the representatives of our societies can be involved in the negotiations.

 All the compromise amendments were proposed in one go and given to Mr Radwan at the same time. At 5 p.m. yesterday afternoon, he decided to take the first and ninth amendments – you will see in your documents that their numbers have changed – and as for the others, Mr Radwan refused them. His two previous comments were made purely and simply in order to manipulate the House.
Lipietz (Verts/ALE

 – (FR)
 Mr President, Mr Radwan’s oral amendment is incorporated in the compromise amendment AC55 which, in my view, should be voted on before Amendment No 44 as it includes the following amendments. Therefore, since the usual order is that we firstly vote on the amendments that deviate the most from the committee’s report, I would propose that we now vote on AC55, which includes Mr Radwan’s oral amendment, as per the discussion we had yesterday at 5 p.m., and which also includes Amendments Nos 44 and 33.
Lipietz (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, we have exactly the same problem. The oral amendment is part of compromise amendment AC53. AC53 contains aspects of Amendments Nos 46 and 32. The adoption of Mr Radwan’s oral amendment, which I approve, does not in any way imply that we are rejecting those aspects of Amendments Nos 46 and 32. I therefore support the proposal – a logical one at that – for the compromise amendment, which includes all the proposals by various Members, to be voted on first. I think it is totally unacceptable that, in the previous vote, the amendment of one of the points rendered other points null and void which had nothing to do with what was a global compromise amendment, whose aim was to make the House vote on this relatively technical problem as quickly as possible. Therefore, if we do not agree to start with the compromise amendment, we will first have to vote on Mr Radwan’s amendment, then Amendments Nos 46 and 32, which have not lapsed in spite of Mr Radwan’s amendment.

 Once again, ladies and gentlemen, the increase from 10 to 20% is a thoroughly complicated issue which cannot be tabled just before we are about to vote. I think, however, that the compromise amendment submitted to Mr Radwan at 5 p.m., which he approved without hesitation, should certainly be taken before Amendment No 48. I could play the imbecile and say that since Mr Radwan is using tactics that discredit the House, I shall call upon my friends to join forces to reject his oral amendment. As for myself, in the interests of the stability of the financial markets in Europe, I think his amendment is fine. Therefore, I approve it and I ask you to agree to vote on it, and then to adopt it. But I would point out to you that Mr Radwan’s thoroughly devious tactics have also caused amendments approved by the Council and the Commission, as well as many Members, to lapse and I think that devious tactics of this type are a discredit to Parliament.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, nine months have now elapsed since the proposal for a European Commission directive on this ultra-technical but extremely topical subject was referred to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Last spring, when the bubble of the e
-economy burst, we were reminded that banking is a high-risk business. In the autumn, the attacks of 11 September, coupled with the steady increase in industrial accidents and in natural disasters linked to the greenhouse effect, reminded us that insurance is also a high-risk activity. The risk will become higher and higher. For years, the European Union, like the rest of the world, has been standardising both the prudential rules that are essential to these financial activities and the forms of supervision practised by the banking and insurance authorities. We are now called upon to supplement these efforts by regulating those financial conglomerates which contain both banks and insurance companies. This is a particularly urgent task here in Europe, the continent that has pioneered insurance banking. It is made all the more urgent by the fact that the development of life assurance and all forms of capitalised pensions savings is compelling our society to run a great risk. What would happen if the long-term savings of future pensioners were engulfed in a stock-market crash? This is precisely what the present directive seeks to avoid. Its rapid adoption would do no less than make Europe the safest financial area in the world, decisively improving its competitiveness through the geographical factor used by the rating agencies. I will not conceal the fact that, at the start of our debates, some of my honourable colleagues were loath to impose new prudential constraints on the financial sector. There were discussions, and some questioned whether it was expedient for Europe to set out its own rules before the completion of the Basle negotiations on the same subject in 2004. Such misgivings, however, were to be banished by a single event, namely the collapse of the Enron conglomerate in the United States as a result of failure to comply with the prudential rules and breakdowns in the supervisory system. If the European Union adopted this directive, Europe would become the ‘Enron-proof’ continent, so to speak. And so the last misgivings have now melted away. Yes, the directive is needed urgently. No, it must not be watered down, either in its scope or in the rigour and transparency of the prudential rules that the authorities will have to oversee. In the course of these nine eventful months, our committee has met with representatives of the banking and insurance professions; where the latter put forward sound arguments reflecting the public interest, the committee has managed to incorporate most of these into its position. I refer in particular to two groups of amendments, namely those that relate to the choice of calculation method and those designed to instil a degree of flexibility into capital-adequacy requirements in terms of companies’ own funds in the case of groups which are not yet conglomerates. Lastly, your rapporteur has benefited, throughout the course of his work, from the cooperation of the Commission and of the Belgian Presidency, and latterly the Spanish Presidency, of the Council. My warm thanks are extended to both institutions. We have proved on this occasion that the three institutions of the Union are able to take very rapid concerted action when the interests of the public and of the European Union are at stake. As I speak to you, at 5.15 p.m., I have just managed to finalise a handful of compromise amendments incorporating the key points from the amendments that were tabled last week. These seem to offer a good basis for a consensus among most of the groups and to anticipate the bulk of the compromises that will have to be made with the Council. I therefore believe that the House will be able to adopt an almost unanimous resolution tomorrow and that the amended proposal will be very close to that which the Council will adopt. In these circumstances, I believe that one reading, or one reading and a half, if you like, will suffice for us to ratify this directive, and I shall be absolutely delighted at such an outcome. We shall avoid any new Enron-type affairs in Europe, and at the same time we shall have legislation with which we can intensify the Basle discussions by offering our new rules as a model for the rest of the world. This would yield immediate dividends by enhancing the global reputation of our financial activities.

 Our amendment relates to the issue of knowing whether or not we approve the European Central Bank’s policy. Last week, this policy changed between the time when the report by Mr von Wogau was written and the time when our amendments were written. Clearly, we disapproved of the policy the European Central Bank issued the week before last and not the policy that was issued last week. I would like Mr von Wogau to clarify whether he supports the policy issued this week or the policy issued the week before.

 Madam President, Commissioner, as a pro-federalist party, the Group of the Verts/ALE has no objection in principle to the European Union holding an opinion on the national policies of the various Member States. That said, we have in the past shared and we still share the concerns that smaller countries have regarding the abuses that could result from excessive arrogance on the part of higher authorities or larger countries. From this point of view, we consider the decision by the Commission, exercising for the first time its right to reprimand with regard to the specific situation in Ireland, as totally unjustified and, at any rate, as a remarkable blunder given the number of Eurosceptics criticising European integration. We believe that it is totally unjustified, first of all, because the admittedly high level of inflation in Ireland may also be related to the specific nature of the Irish economy, which imports not just its oil but also most of its spare parts from two countries, namely the United States and the United Kingdom, who, over the last few years, have significantly revalued their currencies in relation to the euro. The second reason is that there is no evidence at all that the 2001 budget is “pro-cyclical”; quite the opposite, the American air pocket and American slump risk making it an extremely counter-cyclical budget. The third reason is that although tax reductions by the Irish Government are, admittedly, too high, this issue should have been tackled at the time when, for years, Ireland carried out fiscal dumping by lowering company taxes, thus attracting companies from the continent. It is absolutely incredible that this criticism should be made when the reduction in tax affects citizens rather than companies. In more general terms, as soon as a country has accepted… (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, the exercise I was asked to participate in has proved extraordinarily instructive and, I must say, a real pleasure. There were three constraints I had to manage: the doubts and questions of my fellow Members in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the criticisms expressed by civil society, particularly through the CEE Bankwatch Network and finally the answers and arguments presented in response to both these types of question or criticism by the European Investment Bank.  I would like in particular to thank my fellow Members on the Committee of Economic and Monetary Affairs for the relevance of the questions that they, in a way, entrusted to me to put on their behalf to the European Investment Bank. I would like to thank the civil society volunteers for their competence in monitoring the activities of a bank which, in the final analysis, has an influence on 5% of all investments within the European Union, making it the EU’s largest investor. Finally, without any sycophancy whatsoever, I must thank the President of the European Investment Bank, and his colleagues, for the good will and indeed the warmth with which they undertook to discuss matters with me, to take on board and respond to criticisms, either convincing me of the legitimacy of their approach or accepting our comments and outlining with me appropriate solutions. We have thus arrived at a report on which we are practically unanimous. You have been able to note, indeed, that the amendments concern two mere details. I shall discuss these in the latter part of my speech. Broadly speaking, we were unanimous on the proposals for policy which are directed at least as much to the other bodies of the European Union, and even the Member States, as to the European Investment Bank. We fully share all the priorities which the European Investment Bank set itself and indeed with the pillars forming the basis of the bank’s policy, and grant it full discharge. We must, however, stress that times are changing. Europe is expanding eastwards. It is taking on greater responsibilities with regards to the Balkans, which are not yet included in the accession process. Moreover, Europe has signed up to the Kyoto Agreement which requires it to reduce its production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by 8% on average by the year 2010. In other words, this international agreement will become binding in 7 years’ time. Furthermore, since Lisbon, Europe has given itself the objective of becoming a world power in terms of the knowledge economy and new technologies. Finally, Europe has given priority to the development of SMEs. Europe is seeking to obtain this position of excellence not by means of a ‘Europe Incorporated’ with huge multinational businesses but rather by relying on SMEs. There are three new objectives, then, in relation to the 1999 report, which we shall examine formally today. However, in so doing, we shall of course be examining all the policy directions of the EIB: accession, Kyoto, the development of SMEs towards achieving excellence. We wished to call upon the constituent bodies of the European Union and the EIB itself to reorient its policy in the light of these three objectives which were perhaps not as clear at the time when the EIB adopted its priorities or drew up its 1999 report.  The initial paragraphs of the report before you are absolutely unanimous and aim essentially at expanding or facilitating loans in these three areas. To briefly mention the points on which we did not achieve unanimity, there was the official importance of the NGOs in the preparations for the EIB’s decisions, the affirmation of the Kyoto objectives as a genuine leading factor and finally, the arrangements for the prudential supervision of the EIB. These three points I refer to the decision of the House.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say a few words on the joint resolution, which will, of course, be passed. First, I want to express our regret at the euphemistic wording adopted. To talk of human rights violations, refusing to set words such as assassination, torture and disappearance down in black and white, is a serious matter. You all know full well that, for the victims, an official institution’s refusal to acknowledge the atrocity is, in a way, another sort of torture because it prevents them from mourning, from recovering from this period in their lives, as every post-traumatic treatment centre for the former victims of Latin American dictatorships will tell you. Secondly, it would be unacceptable if we failed to call on the Chilean army to stop interfering in the judicial process in Chile. Some groups have argued that we should not be talking to the Chilean army. That is not correct. Unfortunately, we still need to talk to the Chilean army because the current Chilean constitution gives it the right to take part in the work of the Senate in Chile.

 Mr President, I believe that the successive interventions of our fellow MEPs in the Liberal Group show the complexity of the problem. It is difficult to understand why the Liberals want to do away with tax on e-commerce and to place a tax on the aviation fuel used in aircraft. I think it is important to establish some criteria. Aeroplanes are no less modern than e-commerce. Compact discs are not exactly antediluvian, and it would appear that these have to be taxed, whereas programmes circulating on the Internet are apparently to be exempt from tax. It is important to know, on the one hand, whether a very important aspect of economic activity assists the administration of public services and, from that point of view, taxation (like State funding) is absolutely unavoidable, and e-commerce cannot be exempt from this. On the other hand, taxation must be selected in such a way as to deter the consumer from choosing technologies which are the most harmful to the environment. That is the situation we are in at present, with the lack of a tax on aviation fuel scandalously boosting air travel at the expense of rail travel, even in circumstances in which, for other reasons such as noise and congestion, rail travel should be given preference in Europe. I am thinking in particular of the London-Paris-Amsterdam-Frankfurt quadrilateral. I believe that the position adopted in Mr García-Margallo y Marfil’s two reports, whereby both e-commerce and aviation fuel would be taxed, is excellent and we shall vote in favour of them. We would particularly congratulate the Commission for encouraging us to be bold when it comes to internal taxation of aviation. That being said, our collective view is that another tax should be contemplated, other than that relating to fuels, a tax affecting all airlines whenever their planes take off and land at European Union airports, so that we can circumvent international regulations and be in a position to tax our competitors too.
Lipietz (Verts/ALE

 I am not entirely convinced by all your answers. In the first place I take exception to the argument that any tax tends naturally to reduce the consumption of the factor on which it is levied. It is true for all taxes and today there is no tax where the taxable activity has completely ceased. People have not stopped working just because there is income tax. They have not stopped polluting just because there are taxes on pollution, and they are not about to stop transferring money from one country to another just because there is a Tobin tax. So, clearly, the revenue from this levy will not be zero. It will all depend on its level, but there are a number of possible strategies and I agree completely with you that the objective of funding is secondary to the objective of combating speculation. The thing that astounds me is your claim that a minor amount cannot have a deterrent effect on speculation. The minor amount you mention is precisely in the same order as the daily variations in the euro/dollar exchange rate, and this is something we are attempting to combat by other, infinitely more costly methods.

 Mr President, we are delighted to have confirmation of what we predicted in a recent vote. The European Parliament firmly rejected the election of Mr Fujimori and I am pleased to see honourable Members in the two main groups committing themselves clearly to strong European Parliament support for establishing democracy in Peru. But we are concerned about the fate of Mr Montesinos. The right of asylum cannot be used to protect criminals. The whole world rejoiced when the international resolutions finally began to work against one former dictator, Mr Pinochet. Mr Montesinos cannot be allowed to find refuge in Panama or, as some rumours are beginning to suggest, in Morocco. He should be brought to trial on the grounds of torture, drug-trafficking and the rest by any state where he seeks refuge.

 Mr President, on a point of order. Regarding the questions that will shortly be put to the Commission and the Council, you will be aware that the French Government, confronted by the fuel crisis that has gripped France along with the rest of Europe, took a number of measures yesterday which will drastically alter the conditions of competition and the basis of the fight against the greenhouse effect, and which will, therefore, have an immediate and serious impact on Europe. Mrs Loyola de Palacio had an extremely interesting article published in the French press this morning on this European crisis. Would it be possible for her and/or the Commissioner for Competition to speak during this part-sitting in order to tell us how the Commission intends to react to the fuel crisis, and how the Commission and the Council intend to prevent an outbreak of fiscal dumping in Europe and prepare Europe to deal with this crisis?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not intend to re-open with Mr Duisenberg the debate which we held in committee a while back. The Group of the Greens totally disagrees with the policy of raising interest rates, which has been applied since the end of 1999. We are as displeased by the second period of management by the Bank, starting in the last quarter of 1999, as we were satisfied with the first, not because the Bank overestimates the importance of variations in exchange rates against the dollar – it does in our view, but that is by the by – but because the debate on exchange rates obviously masks the Central Bank's aversion to growth and its serious underestimation of the potential rate of growth of the European Union. Yes, there are difficulties with a rate of growth of 3% but these difficulties imply that there should be more, not less investment and, hence, lower not higher interest rates. What I would like to stress today is the scandal that is the second part of paragraph 11 of the Radwan report. To dare to say that the French 35-hour law is responsible for the fall in the euro because it has weakened European competitiveness overall is an intellectual lie, pure and simple. It was after this law was announced that the Toyota factory – and many others – decided to open in France. If the MEPs consider that the Toyota factory does not know what it is doing, that is their right; that these MEPs claim to suggest such absurd rules to national governments and European social policy, frankly, seems to us...

) Mr President, fellow Members, the Greens, like several other groups, had tabled a motion for a resolution on Paraguay. As is customary in the House, we have tried to agree on a joint resolution. Unfortunately, we cannot put our names to it as it stands. As you are aware, the situation in Paraguay is characterised not only by a revolutionary tendency in certain sections of the army but, more generally, by very serious human rights violations and the harsh suppression of popular movements. We have tried, in our resolution, to emphasise both these factors simultaneously. Given the very long history of Europe itself, you will be well aware that, in countries where human rights are not observed by a government, generally republican or democratic or claiming to be republican or democratic, this government runs the risk of a military coup d’état. In a way, governments get the coups d’état they deserve, and a weak democracy is vulnerable to military coups d’état. The resolution before us simply pays tribute to the initiative used by another Southern Cone country to arrest the leader of a military coup d’état and extradite him to his country of origin. We welcome this initiative on the part of Brazil, but to say that and nothing more would mean framing a resolution on Brazil, not Paraguay. We can welcome the progress that Brazil is making on the road to democratic cooperation in the Southern Cone, but that does not make it a resolution on Paraguay. We would have liked the issue of human rights as managed by the legally constituted government in Paraguay to be specifically taken into account. We would have liked the European Union to exploit the methods of democratic persuasion afforded due to the aid it provides to all the Southern Cone countries in order to encourage the legitimate government in Paraguay to show greater respect for human rights. Unfortunately, in the current wording of the resolution, this is not the case, and we consequently prefer to vote against the joint motion for a resolution and, if necessary, maintain our own motion for a resolution.
Lipietz (Verts/ALE

) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Greens wanted the joint resolution of this House to specifically consider the illegality of the election of Mr Fujimori as President of Peru and to ask that fresh elections be organised. The joint resolution which will be proposed to you and to which the Greens have not put their names, merely highlights the irregularities and concludes that these challenge the legitimacy of this election. We are therefore dealing with a far weaker declaration than the one we wanted. First, we deplore such a cautious choice of words. Let me remind you that the conditions of this election, at least in the second round, were so disastrous that not only did the main opposition candidate withdraw, but so did all the international observers. In these circumstances, it could be concluded, even before the election, that the election was not valid. After the election, obviously, Mr Fujimori’s government could argue that since their candidate Fujimori had obtained more than 51%, it had to be concluded that even in the absence of any opposition, the vote was valid. Having said this, the vote count in many regions showed an excess of theoretical votes in relation to the first round, which is completely impossible given that there were no longer any opposition candidates. The excess vote was around 20% in some places. So not only was there no opposition, but it was even necessary to resort to fraud in order to obtain the figure of 51%. These observations should lead the European Parliament to proclaim the illegality of the election of Mr Fujimori and call for more elections, rather than being content with merely questioning its legitimacy. Unlike the case of Paraguay, we are not going to see this as a reason for voting against the resolution. We are prepared to put our names to the joint resolution of the other groups, provided, however, that two points are introduced. We agree with what Mr Salafranca said about making European Union aid conditional on sending a European Parliament delegation on current human rights to Peru.  However, we think this insufficient as, at this very moment, since the election in fact, military demonstrations and intimidation are being used against those members of the population who show their fury at this election, which is invalid in their eyes. We therefore ask that a tiny amendment be added, condemning the use of intimidation against the Peruvian population. This condemnation is not accompanied by any particular threat, and with regard to the conditionality of European Union aid, we gladly support the wording put forward by Mr Salafranca. The second amendment we are proposing, on the other hand, is a sort of catching-up on the matter of legality. You know that the Organisation of American States goes further than the European Parliament’s joint proposal apparently does, as this organisation is actually volunteering to suggest a democratic way out of the political crisis which Peru is stuck in over this matter. We are simply suggesting that the Parliament should approve the current efforts of the Organisation of American States to find a legal, peaceful way out of the crisis. These are the two amendments that would enable us simply to support the joint motion for a resolution.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you why the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance did not vote in favour of the Katiforis report as amended by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Obviously, we endorse the general thrust of the Katiforis report. In particular, we approve of the ambition to achieve full employment as well as its ambition in terms of sound social and, above all, salary agreements. On the other hand, we did not endorse a raft of amendments which we considered to be extremely dangerous. We shall reject these amendments. Indeed, we shall reject them systematically, and we hope within the current parliamentary term to convince our fellow Members, including those in the Group of the European People’s Party, how dangerous they are. In the first place, we can no longer continue to call for the flexibility of wage contracts to be reformed and increased without specifying our thinking more precisely. Endorsing the goal of a European society which is as competitive as possible in terms of know-how means maximising investment in human capital. Well, enhanced human capital is not a commodity to be taken and then dispensed with, but rather something to be respected, something that is offered to an individual by allowing them time to be trained, to gain and enhance experience. So if there must be structural reform in wages, then it must be in the direction of greater, and not less, stability in employment. There is a second fundamental point of which I desperately hope to convince my fellow Members in the next five – now four – years, and that is that we cannot claim to wish to respect the Kyoto Agreement by the year 2008. We are aware, and the report acknowledges as much, that, at the moment, it is contradictory to attempt to reconcile an objective of 3% annual growth with the rejection of the urgent requirement to invest in energy saving, transport systems, in improving accommodation, in such a way as to make the Kyoto objectives and the objective of 3% growth compatible.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the Single European Act was ratified, the financial products market has been developing, despite the warnings of the Greens, without regard to the minimum harmonisation of taxation on income from savings. What was bound to happen has happened. There has been fiscal dumping onto the most mobile factors and a transfer of the tax burden onto the least mobile factor, which is labour. The responsibility for blocking the tax harmonisation provided for in the Monti package currently rests entirely with one country: Great Britain. Great Britain is trying to shift the blame onto Luxembourg, which is actually willing to compromise. Let me formally notify our British colleagues that this attitude is irritating the rest of Europe. Great Britain is the mother of democracy and of modern capitalism. Its attitude of encouraging tax fraud has a corrupting effect not only in economic and social terms, but in moral terms as well. It is challenging the civic foundations of European construction.   That is why the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has decided to reject any new proposal to liberalise the capital market, unless the Monti package is first adopted. This is the suggestion, moreover, of Mr Prodi’s Commission itself, and that was the key point of the García-Margallo y Marfil report on the action plan to unite the financial services markets. Unfortunately, this point has been changed out of all recognition by the amendments of the right within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.

Mr President, the passion that the previous speakers have acknowledged in Mr Katiforis, in my view, only served to call on the European Parliament to respond to the hope of dozens of millions of unemployed people, social outcasts and those living a precarious existence in our European Union. This is the objective, in respect of which he called upon the European Parliament: give hope to the people of Europe. There is indeed economic recovery, but it only marginally reduces unemployment in Europe. The votes of the PPE-DE and the Liberals have very considerably diminished, and even reversed, the meaning of his message. That is why we did not vote in favour of the report as amended by them, despite our efforts, and we shall not vote for it as it stands at the moment. What are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report? First of all, the affirmation that there is room for a Europe of growth, but a Europe of sustainable growth, that particularly respects the commitments of the European Union at the conferences in Kyoto and Buenos Aires. There is an enormous amount of work to be done to keep to our commitments by the fateful year 2008, by which time we shall have to return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions. A tremendous amount of work remains to be done in the field of transport, energy saving and even in substituting travel by communication via the Internet. Secondly, even the growth rate of 3 or 4%, something we consider eminently feasible, will not be sufficient to reduce unemployment if we do not improve the job content of this growth. And we should say so very clearly, it will involve more savings on services, more third systems, more reductions in average working hours, whatever methods we adopt to achieve these things. Thirdly, we fully agree that it is necessary to reform labour relations in Europe, but that clearly means for us that we must protect and enrich the human capital. The lesson learned from the European experience is that where wages are lowest, where the salary ratio is the most flexible, unemployment is the highest and where wages are highest, where the social relations are the best regulated, the unemployment rate is the lowest.

Mr President, the report presented to us today seeks to complete the free movement of financial investments in Europe, including the most sophisticated forms of investment. We do not, in principle, oppose this industry. However, unlike Mr Christopher Huhne, we feel that a continent which has proved incapable of controlling its oil industry properly should not overly deregulate an industry which may, in time, provoke the same type of crisis. We shall therefore vote cautiously on all amendments limiting recourse to excessively derivative instruments and we shall vote in favour of all amendments which limit the excessive concentration of assets within a single financial group. But we make no bones about the fact that we shall vote against the text as a whole. We shall also vote in the future against any proposals to deregulate the financial markets and we call on all the other political groups to do likewise until such time as taxation on investment income is finally harmonised. For years certain countries, including Great Britain, have been blocking harmonisation and turning their financial centres into tax havens. They even reject the strict minimum, i.e. the Monti package proposed by the Commission in Brussels. This attitude is turning Europe into a machine which exempts investment income from tax and shifts the whole tax burden to commercial income, with all the social and even moral consequences which that implies. We must put an end to this. By blocking the demands of the financial industry, the European Parliament has the means to ensure that countries which have been turned into tax havens end up with their back against the wall.

 Mr President, Commissioner, there are just two questions which must be answered. Are state aid to business or inter-company agreements legitimate in a market economy, and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy? Regarding the first point, we say quite clearly that, in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed, it is essential that, in some instances, there is state aid to businesses, be it in the form of tax exemptions, special taxation or even direct aid. It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements, since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements. So our clear response is that, yes, such aid and such agreements are legitimate, but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified. The von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level. We feel this is relatively dangerous, but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything. We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact.

 Commissioner, I come from a country where the boss of a multinational company, Michelin, decided to inform his shareholders first of his decision to make 10% of his employees in various countries redundant over the next three years.  In the course of last month’s part-session, Commissioner, you stated, in a warm and convincing way, the Commission’s determination to protect employees’ rights in terms of information and consultation about their future. We are delighted that you are determined to see this into the Portuguese Presidency. However, and contrary to what the previous speaker has just said, the Greens think that these rights should be extended to all companies that are not part of the small-business sector and we propose a minimum of twenty employees. If we adopted, as the Commission seems to want to do, a minimum of fifty employees, this would cause serious distortions of competition, affecting only 3% of European companies.  One day we will have to go further. In several European countries, the participation of workers is something which society sets great store by. Participation in decision making and also participation in the results. The European Council did not want to follow Parliament’s advice on this matter. Today however, by means of pension funds, pensioners are participating more and more in companies’ capital, in their management and in their profits.  It would be paradoxical and would even threaten a war between the generations if current employees were to be excluded from this kind of participation.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines rightly stress employability, i.e. the possibility for job seekers to actually do the job they are applying for. But we must never forget that this is just a possibility. Between this possibility and the reality of the job itself everything will depend on the state of job vacancies in society. On this subject, the guidelines speak of enterprise spirit. They are right but, in order to flourish, the entrepreneur needs favourable policy, low interest rates, a competitive euro and, above all, he needs to know the relationship between a given business activity and the number of job offers. This is the fundamental problem of the relationship between employment levels and growth. You acknowledge that with growth at less than 2.4% there was no reduction in employment. France is currently refuting this diagnosis thanks to its policy of reducing working hours, which is still too cautious. Let us hope that this policy is intensified and that it is extended in a coordinated fashion to Europe as a whole. Finally, there is one form of enterprise which is particular good at creating jobs; i.e. cooperatives, associations, the third sector. This sector merits a special status, particularly as regards taxation, and this is the subject of the amendments which we are putting to you.

 Mr President, this is the first time that the new Parliament is fulfilling its mission of supervising the European Central Bank. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance heartily supports the Huhne report, not only for its professional quality but also for its general attitude of mind. It is effectively a response to the fundamental problem which faces us today, that of accountability in managing monetary policy. What is the nature of this problem? The Central Bank is not a fourth estate. It is not, for example, in a position to challenge the social rights gained by Europeans. These rights are enshrined either in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in national bodies of legislation and in conventions between management and unions. The Central Bank, on the other hand, has been assigned a specific function by Europeans, that of ensuring price stability. The Maastricht Treaty is not very specific on the manner in which it must actually be accountable for the fulfilment of its mission with regard to national representatives. All central or international banks of major countries are bound, in one form or another, by this democratic accountability with regard to the socio-economic community – in the Anglo-Saxon countries through Parliament and in Germany through the federate banks of the Länder
. Today we have to invent the forms of democratic responsibility of the European Central Bank. The Huhne report already provides many possible routes. We support the two amendments tabled by the rapporteur himself, for publication of votes in the Council of the European Central Bank and the econometric models on which these votes are based. Only the most complete transparency of the relationship between the objectives set by the Treaty and the actions of the members of the Council will make it possible for Europeans to actually measure whether the members of the Council are fulfilling their mission properly, not that we doubt it. From this point of view, the Huhne report is justifiably very pleased with the reduction in interest rates which occurred in April. Apart from the positive effect of this decision on employment, it is in line with the objective of ecological sustainability, which is to say the rejection of a policy of excessively favouring immediate prospects at the expense of long- term future prospects. This is why our group is concerned about the rumours of a forthcoming increase in interest rates. Such a decision would compromise both the upturn in employment in Europe and ecological investment, especially that related to saving energy and combating the greenhouse effect. Such a decision could only be taken in the event that price stability was threatened. Well, price stability applies in both directions. For many months, the consumer price index has been increasing at a rate of 1%, while the industrial price index 
on the other hand has been decreasing, at a rate of 1%. This deflation in industrial prices prompts giving preference to short-term prospects. It would become dangerous if real interest rates were to increase. In order to prevent such situations arising, our Group is proposing an amendment drawing the attention of the European Central Bank to its mandate to ensure price stability in both directions.

 Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, today this House is examining the human rights situation and European policy in relation to third countries. I have decided to devote my speech to Syria. I am sure you will be aware of the fact that, in that country, the defenders of human rights and democratic freedoms are suffering constant pressure and harassment. Several reports by NGOs condemn flagrant violations: people in prison because of their opinions, political exiles, repeated interrogations, interruption of speakers, arrests, torture, and sometimes disappearances. Aktham Naissé, Chairman of the Committees for the Defence of Democratic Freedoms and Human Rights in Syria, was arrested on 13 April by the military security forces. He is being held in detention at a secret location. He is not allowed to have his medical treatment, despite the fact that his state of health is giving grave cause for concern. It even seems that he will shortly have to appear before the State Security Court. Is there any threat to public order or act of terrorism in defending human rights? Ahmad Khazen and Hassan Watfa were arrested on 15 and 16 March 2004 by the military security forces and sentenced to prison for having taken part in a deputation to the parliament, calling for democratic reforms and the lifting of the state of emergency. To date, Syrian civil society has still not heard or seen any reaction from the European Commission. Yet the Commission’s delegation to Damascus has already witnessed several of these violations. It is not a matter of interference, but rather of defending universal values for which we have a responsibility. Allow me to remind you that we are currently in the process of negotiating an association agreement with Syria. Agreements of this type are based on the rule of law, and Article 2 of such agreements clearly stipulates an undertaking, on the part of both parties, to respect human rights. In Syria, a state of emergency has been in existence for 41 years, thus enabling martial law to be applied by means of military courts. This is contrary to the rule of law and respect for fundamental freedoms as guaranteed by international law and the Barcelona Declaration. Exactly one month ago, on 22 March in Athens, we created the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, of which Syria is a member. Such a partnership can only be constructed on the basis of certain requirements such as respect for human rights and democratic freedoms. I should therefore like to ask you to intervene as a matter of urgency with the Syrian authorities, and ask them to guarantee the integrity of the people I have just referred to, to order their immediate and unconditional release, to put an end to the constant pressure and harassment, to respect international law and to comply with the provisions of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the international instruments which have been ratified by Syria. Our democracies have ways of exerting pressure. If we do not use them to ensure that our universal values are respected we shall lose our souls. There are many of us, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, who are waiting for a response from you, because no indulgence can be allowed when human rights are being violated.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking everyone who has contributed to this work and helped to improve it. Since the Charter of Fundamental Rights was adopted, it has been the European Parliament’s frame of reference when drawing up its annual report on fundamental rights, a report which is an essential part of our parliamentary life. The Charter of Fundamental Rights is effectively seen as a definitive set of guidelines. For 2003, however, we have taken a slightly different approach, looking at only a few articles of the Charter and comparing them with what we find in reality and practice. The first question we might ask is why is the European Parliament interested in fundamental rights? Well, my answer is that this House is the expression of the people’s sovereignty and it is therefore bound to speak out on matters directly affecting the citizens, especially where their dignity is concerned, since its main role is to represent them and to defend their interests. Public freedoms and fundamental rights are enshrined in our constitutions and in our national and European laws. The draft European Constitution even includes the Charter of Fundamental Rights in its preamble. The European Parliament’s legitimacy in matters relating to fundamental rights has been strengthened by Article 7. It may, on the basis of a reasoned proposal, formally notify the Council where there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a Member State of principles mentioned in Article 6. In this respect, this report should strengthen the European Parliament’s capacity to carry out its role in monitoring fundamental rights within the EU. This is the fourth report. As you know, the report is written by a different political group every year. This year, I had the pleasure of preparing it. In this report, we have tried to gauge the effectiveness of the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, to gauge their effectiveness in respect of all individuals, irrespective of gender, ethnic or cultural origin, sexual orientation, religion, handicap or status. Since 11 September 2001 in particular, we have seen an enormous number of measures taken at both EU and national level to combat terrorism, transnational crime and illegal immigration. Today, in the name of EU security, limits are being imposed on our public freedoms and fundamental rights. Many measures are directly or indirectly affecting a number of vulnerable groups and social movements. However justified the fight against crime, insecurity and terrorism may be, it should under no circumstances be allowed to undermine fundamental rights and democratic freedoms since this would threaten the very foundations of the European Union. We have therefore chosen to take as the report’s underlying theme the criminalisation of social movements and vulnerable groups. Target groups which we have identified include trade unions, support and human rights groups, migrants and refugees, victims of trafficking in human beings, Roma and gypsies, journalists, women, children and people with impaired mobility. My attention has been drawn to three points in particular, which I would like to outline to you briefly. So far as the freedom of the press is concerned, the existence of free pluralist media strengthens the principle of democracy. On the question of media pluralism, we have just put to the vote a report by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on the risks of the violation thereof in the European Union and especially in Italy. I will not therefore go over the matter again, but I would like to remind you that her report refers to the provision of information to EU citizens and the duty of the media and institutions to respect the citizen’s right to be fully and objectively informed. The right to objective information is vulnerable to that information being politically manipulated. Unfortunately, we saw some examples of this in the United Kingdom at the time of the Iraq war and in France during the heat wave. The report shows, for example, that some governments have a virtual monopoly and that in some countries television, the private sector or the press are highly concentrated. The freedom of the press and unfortunately often our rights, too, are threatened by this very concentration of the media and the pressure that some journalists find themselves under when providing their information, because of their political or ideological affiliation. The directive will therefore have to be amended to require Member States to preserve media pluralism and strengthen the protection of confidential sources. I turn now to the right of asylum. Europe’s humanist tradition of asylum rights is being replaced by a closed-border security policy. Laws are not yet harmonised, a variety of national laws are often used to restrict the right of asylum and the treatment meted out in detention centres and living conditions in them are far from ideal. We must of course be able to guarantee the right to health and to ensure that all citizens enjoy that right. All rights of this nature are linked to citizenship and we are well aware that European citizenship cannot be built without these rights in today’s Europe. I am therefore asking you to be particularly vigilant to ensure that our rights, which are increasingly threatened, remain the only things that govern our policies. Finally, if the European Union is to be credible, if it is itself to respect rights and be respected, it must put its own house in order and not be afraid to respond and take action when violations occur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the day after the creation of the EMPA, the European Union has, as everyone has said, a duty to become involved in peace building within the logic of the Barcelona process. The Union bears a historic and political responsibility, and it can no longer content itself only with issuing condemnations when the region is ablaze or weeping when terrorism strikes. Now, the United States tells us that it has a plan for the Middle East. How, though, can we talk in terms of plans when we know that Syria has a presence in Lebanon, when the occupation in Iraq is ongoing and when a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has still not been found? This plan is, indeed, disputed and disputable. It is disputed because the United States has not bothered to discuss it with the countries concerned. This clearly reveals America’s mistrust and their unilateral practices, just as the pre-emptive war in Iraq did. It also reflects the geopolitical ignorance of the United States and the generalisations it makes by including Maghreb in the Middle East, and Pakistan and Afghanistan among the Arab countries. Finally, what does this plan advocate? The fight against terrorism? Yes, but with the installation of American bases in the region. Has not this been the case since 1990-1991? Resolution of the conflict? Yes, but to be credible, it would be necessary to fight all forms of terrorism, including the state terrorism conducted by Israel, which is doggedly trying to exterminate the Palestinian people, yet with total impunity. Lastly, democratic reforms? Certainly, yes, they are inevitable and essential, because the people are today suffering an economic, political and democratic deficit. These reforms are needed, but so is economic development. Finally, and in conclusion, only by reducing the gap between the ruling classes and the people will these reforms be possible. Civil society must be involved. It is for this reason that we in Europe must support the forces of progress or internal forces for peace and strengthen dialogue in order to dispel fears, to finally put an end to this violence and to let our common values govern us.

I am indignant at the conclusions of our rapporteur that these scientific exchanges cannot be affected by political considerations! This is denying the political dimension of human rights under Article 2 of the Euro-Mediterranean agreement and contradicting the Barcelona process based on respect for fundamental rights. Israel systematically violates human rights in territories occupied by colonisation and occupation, violates democratic principles with regard to thousands of Palestinians, Israeli citizens, victims of discrimination. Israel is violating the Geneva Convention, international law, the United Nations Charter and the Vienna Convention by not respecting the trade clauses of its association agreement. This is a real human, ecological and political disaster. It is an annexation, undermining the creation of a Palestinian State, ghettoising Palestinians and ruining all hopes of peace. The EU cannot have trade or scientific relations with a third country without taking into consideration the abuses of international law that it is guilty of. Given that the EU reacted in the former Yugoslavia and in Africa, refusing to be complicit or complacent in the face of violations of humanitarian law, why should it keep silent in the case of Israel?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you have said, despite all our efforts the Tampere agenda will not be complied with, especially on the matter of immigration and asylum. But we will only find an effective answer to these questions, be it in Sangatte or Algeciras, by having a genuine Community policy that respects basic rights, not by always being repressive. A lot of Commission proposals are currently pending in the Council. The few measures that have been taken are constantly criticised and the directive on family reunification is the subject of an action by our Parliament before the Court of Justice. On this question of emigration, I would simply ask you to follow the train of thought developed before our Parliament by Kofi Annan. Not only does our old continent need these workers, but the only way we will have credibility in the world is by affirming an open, pluralist Europe that shows solidarity. Immigration is an opportunity for Europe’s future and at a time when racism and xenophobia are swooping down on us we need to say that strongly and forcefully. We are convinced that freedom of movement together with a positive policy of legal immigration will enable us to apply the brake to trafficking, especially trafficking in human beings. We will then be better placed to devote ourselves to building a citizenship in which all who live on our continent will be able to participate fully, with equal rights respected – not to mention the fact that such a voluntarist policy will also alleviate the burden on us as regards both asylum systems and fighting illegal immigration. It will not yet be possible to adopt the two asylum directives, on the status of refugees and asylum procedures, despite the December deadline that was set and has now passed. But we know it is essential that they should be adopted to round off the first phase of the Tampere programme. Having said that, those two directives must also and in particular bring an added value capable of guaranteeing asylum seekers a better level of protection. So far as police and judicial cooperation is concerned, I would like to dwell on just one point, that of personal data, biometric data in particular. In a communication on the transfer of data, published by the Commission on 16 December and forwarded to the Council and the Parliament, concerning the agreement concluded between the United States and ourselves, we find a security gaffe under the cover of the fight against terrorism and crime. The agreement would in fact allow the data fields transferred to include date of birth, number of persons travelling together, credit card details, racial or ethnic origin and political, religious or philosophical beliefs. But that is a serious attack on the protection of private life. What can be done about it? When we know that such information can be used as a means of discrimination, that provision also affects our basic freedoms, especially since we do not know exactly who will have access to the data. We can only be concerned about the uses to which it will be put. In this connection, did you know that, under pressure from the United States, in particular threats to ban flights, airlines are already transferring personal data to the US authorities without the consent of the persons concerned? Such action is contrary to European law and the Commission is supposed to be the guardian of the Treaties. Such measures affect both Europeans and third country nationals, as you said, Mr Vitorino. That agreement was nevertheless concluded without any prior democratic debate. It is therefore democracy and the rule of law that are threatened by the conclusion of such agreements. Should a genuinely independent European control body not be set up as a matter of urgency to prevent such data being abused? And do you not think that the Court of Justice should also be asked to rule on the legality of that agreement? We must be vigilant because security is taking precedence over respect for our rights and our freedoms. Finally and to conclude, how are we going to be able to guarantee respect for our fundamental rights if we sign an agreement with a country like the United States, which is constantly showing its desire for hegemony, conducts a unilateral policy and puts itself above the law, including above international law, as in the situation of the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay? I would be grateful, Commissioner, if you would exercise the utmost vigilance with regard to all these treaties.

 Mr President, I note our rapporteur’s concern to strike a balance between secure borders and respect for basic rights and I welcome our committee’s work to give this report a more humanitarian face. I also welcome the European Commission’s efforts to develop genuine European policies on immigration and asylum. Despite all these efforts, the Tampere agenda will not, however, be kept to. Many of the Commission’s proposals are at present pending before the Council. The few measures that have been taken come in for regular criticism and the directive on family reunification is still the subject of an appeal by our Parliament before the Court of Justice. For some time now, we have noted with regret that the driving force behind immigration and asylum policy has been the security of the Member States above all. In reality, this results in an intensive and often disproportionate struggle against illegal immigration, which is considered a threat, a source of terrorism and a destabilising factor. That is therefore the vision of the Council and the Member States, a highly security-conscious, repressive and utilitarian vision geared to their own needs and disregarding the needs of others. The proliferation of border control authorities is an illustration of this. While it is legitimate for the Union to want to protect its residents and its interests, the Member States must be aware that only an overall, integrated approach will produce an effective European policy. For that, such an approach must at one and the same time include a management of migratory flows that allows legal immigration, the socio-economic, cultural and political integration of third country nationals and cooperation with third countries in a Community framework. Fighting illegal immigration means above all protecting its victims, in particular fighting the trafficking in human beings and the networks of unscrupulous smugglers. To this end, we call on the Member States to ratify the Palermo Convention. To date, only Denmark, France and Spain have done so. Illegal immigration will not dry up so long as there are still such yawning economic and political gaps between North and South. People are right to want to flee horrendous situations. All too often, the democratic deficit goes hand in hand with the social and humanitarian deficit. We must not, however, bury our heads in the sand: illegal immigration is also a necessity for our economy. Today, all liberal policies argue for a return to a measure of specific immigration. Thus, the countries of the North are allowed to transform the South into a manpower supermarket to meet the needs of its enterprises for a specific period. This effectively plunders the productive forces of the South. The Union’s policy for fighting illegal immigration will not be credible without measures to combat moonlighting, but instead of penalising those who come to our countries looking for hope, we should be penalising employers who shamelessly exploit immigrants who have no papers. On the other hand, such a policy must regularise those immigrants’ situations, recognise them, give them rights, give them the means to fight against discrimination and exclusion and make them our equals. Any returning of people whose situation is irregular must fully respect their human rights and comply with international conventions, including the right to seek asylum. The European Parliament will shortly be deciding on the Italian initiative which seeks to coordinate expulsions of aliens by using joint European charters. We clearly condemn such a project, which neither complies with our international commitments nor respects basic rights. Readmission agreements can be an adequate framework for a return policy only if they take sufficient account both of the interests of the third countries and the wishes and plans of the person concerned. For that to happen, they must be given genuine assisted returns so that they can be fully reintegrated both socially and economically. (The President cut off the speaker)

Mr President, as you know, numerous opinion polls have revealed how remote Europe is from its people and how much remains to be done to bridge that gap. Community initiatives designed to promote European citizenship do exist, but of course they are still inadequate. The decision to establish a five-year programme of subsidies to promote active European citizenship is a good thing. Promoting the idea of European citizenship so that the people assume responsibility for Europe and equip themselves with the means of exercising that responsibility is certainly the aim of this proposal, which should strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the Union and enhance its transparency. To that end, however, we must also simplify procedures with a view to ensuring that the largest possible number of associations can benefit from this new instrument. Moreover, it is observable that a hierarchical structure is developing among these organisations, a structure for which, I regret to say, there is not always any justification. Objective criteria should be defined by the European Commission for funding the operation and activities of the various NGOs, particularly those that are directly involved on the ground in practising the solidarity to which we are pledged. Let us not forget that it is thanks to them that social cohesion is maintained in the socially deprived areas of Europe where exclusion and discrimination are rife. How can we convince young people that Europe is a reality, how can we give them confidence in Europe, if Europe takes no practical action to combat discrimination? People in the field have been heard to say that the Commission maintains special relationships with particular associations. If this assertion were true, such a situation would be unacceptable. On the other hand, while the social dimension is accentuated, for which we thank our rapporteur, we cannot choose to disregard the political dimension, which is indispensable if the present democratic deficit is to be reduced. So what citizenship are we discussing? The report specifies that citizenship of the European Union complements and broadens national citizenship through the recognition of common rights. It derives from the need felt by the members of this Community to share their common democratic values in the process of constructing the Union. How long can we go on talking about a European construction process that excludes those 15 to 18 million residents of Europe who are nationals of third countries? By virtue of their active participation in European integration, they are no less European citizens than anyone else, and their associations and NGOs are also actively engaged in the effort to promote Europe. We undoubtedly want a Europe of the people, a truly democratic Europe where solidarity prevails. To that end, we must renew and enhance this European citizenship. Now that we have free movement of capital, goods and persons, it goes without saying that the people of Europe must be able to assume their responsibilities and enjoy their rights in whatever European country they have chosen to live. Europe cannot accept a tiered system of citizenship in which some of its inhabitants are more equal than others. Everyone who shares this one European territory must be able to enjoy equal rights in his or her country of normal residence. To this end, the European citizenship we create must no longer be based on nationality but on residence. Too often in Europe, nationality and citizenship are indissolubly linked. In this respect, we can benefit from the interesting experience of the acceding countries, which distinguish between the concepts of citizenship and nationality. We want our old Europe to draw inspiration from this injection of fresh impetus in order to create a new definition of European citizenship, based on residence.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the situation in occupied Palestine is a disaster. The number of people living in poverty has tripled. The Palestinian people are starving, when they are not being killed by Israeli bullets. The social and economic crisis is worsening in Israel too, and even the most vulnerable communities are not spared. The situation in Iraq is a further factor for destabilisation in the region. The European Council of 16 and 17 October confirmed that the Mediterranean region was of crucial importance. We should also support the democratic process, assist social and economic development and strengthen political dialogue to ensure that the region is finally able to enjoy peace. As Mr Menéndez del Valle states in his report, there can be no military solution. We must break free of this downward spiral of violence and get back on the track of negotiations and of ensuring that the law is observed. We must force Israel to end this process of establishing settlements and this military occupation, which lie at the root of this appalling situation. It is equally crucial to exert all possible pressure, including economic and trade pressure, not only to stop the construction of this apartheid-style wall, but also to destroy it. This wall is a human and environmental disaster, and is also an affront to the values that we hold dear. These actions run counter to the commitments given in the road map. It is our duty to encourage all peace initiatives and in this area, we should attach particular importance to the peace plan known as the ‘Swiss agreement’. We believe that this is a moderate and balanced plan, even if many, who are being asked to make further compromises, find it hard to accept. Although it provides no real answer to the refugee question, this agreement is needed, in order to restore confidence and to give new hope to the two peoples. As we have often said, only the existence of two democratic, sovereign and viable States, as recognised in the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as the capital, will allow the justice and dignity crucial to peace to be established and provide for a future that offers real possibilities. This agreement allows the legitimacy of international law to be re-established. We must do everything we can to ensure that this is supported by the Quartet, particularly by the Europeans. I would like to express my fear to you, my fear of seeing a new hope dashed, leaving the way open for an even more radical approach, which would only benefit those who prefer violence to the law and war to peace. We have a major political responsibility: we must assume this responsibility in the eyes of history and in the eyes of the world and we must break this silence, which would make us just as guilty for this new crime against humanity. Lastly, I wish to pay tribute to the courage of the progressive forces in Israel and of all those who refuse to carry out missions that they consider to be illegal and which cause civilian deaths. We must offer them our utmost solidarity. To conclude, we must emphasise civilian missions, in which international organisations play the role of moderator and protector: as a result of their action on the ground, they successfully conduct a citizens’ diplomacy, where our international diplomacy is unable to act. We must ask the Commission and the Council to ask the UN Security Council to send a peacekeeping force to protect the Palestinian people, their heritage and their environment.

 Mr Nielson, let me take this opportunity to remind you that on 10 April our Parliament voted on a Resolution to freeze the Association Agreement. Now, eighteen months later, this Resolution is still being ignored. Could we see this as unwavering support for the Israeli state’s policy despite its violations of human rights and international law? We could, for we are talking about economic, commercial agreements, about financial interests, but we also about the right to life. This colonial war claims more and more victims. Even though the roadmap made provision to colonisation to be put on ice, the Jewish colonies continue to grow and roads around them are still being built. In Israel the situation is tragic. The discrimination against some Israeli citizens is increasing; they are persecuted, denied certain rights because they are Arab Israelis. The Knesset enacted a law to prevent Palestinians from obtaining Israeli citizenship by marriage. This is a discriminatory and racist law. A recent report by FIDH, the International Federation for Human Rights, has revealed to us a modern form of slavery of migrant workers. Even Mr Abraham Burg, a former President of the Knesset, raised the alarm. He said that Israel is a framework of corruption, based on foundations of oppression and injustice, which reduces itself to a colonist state, headed by a clique of individuals who are without morals, are above the law and corrupt. In the occupied territories the situation is tragic. A wall of shame embodies the apartheid and injustice, and the Palestinian society is living a tragedy. We are not, of course, going to count the deaths. Who are the victims of terrorism though, of this State terrorism that assassinates refugees on a daily basis? To conclude, Mr President, I will say that we cannot remain silent. Is it not our duty to put pressure on the Israeli Government, with all the means that we have at our disposal including economic and commercial ones? Why not paralyse the Association Agreement as we courageously did before in South Africa against the apartheid?

 Mr President, I would like to welcome this report, which is an informative instrument on more than one level: it is an excellent compilation of the existing legislation, it monitors accurately the development of the legislation and, in particular, the effects of 11 September, and it provides clear proof that the perception of danger has changed the terms of the balance between freedom and security, that the increase in the number of exceptional laws has substantially limited our fundamental rights and held them up to ridicule. With the adoption of European provisions such as the framework decisions on terrorism and the European arrest warrant, or even the freezing of assets of certain entities and individuals considered to be terrorists, the European Union is consolidating the many anti-terrorism and repressive laws adopted by the Member States. However, if the need to combat terrorism must not be an excuse to adopt discriminatory and arbitrary laws, the absence of a clear and precise definition of terrorism in European legislation today allows the implicit criminalisation of social movements linked to freedom of expression and freedom of association. A simple suspicion can result in detention. Entire populations that were already vulnerable have been even more so since 11 September: nationals of third countries, asylum-seekers, Roma and Muslims. With disregard for fundamental rights and public freedoms, these populations are often treated as if they pose a threat or a danger to state security and it is easy to blame it on 11 September. It allows us to ignore the real issues society must face: integration, xenophobia and immigration and asylum policy. Today, the fight against terrorism serves as a pretext for the fight against immigration, which is no longer considered to be anything but illegal. The association agreements with Algeria, for example, are a good illustration of this amalgam of terrorism and immigration. The same applies to the agreements on the readmission of sans-papiers
 sent to third countries. The list of violations carried out within the European Union by the states and institutions is a long one: xenophobia, double punishment, arbitrary detention, discriminatory practices as regards hiring and housing, and offences based on identity. Yet human rights have no borders, so we must be frank and begin by putting our own house in order. We must stop using human rights as a currency with third countries; the aim of the European Union is to promote peace, the values of freedom, justice and solidarity and the welfare of its people. We must now make all efforts to ensure that human rights are at last respected in the European Union for all residents, regardless of their nationality.  (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although these agreements on judicial and police cooperation are extremely important, our values must still be respected. I would like to ask two questions. Given that the death penalty still exists in the USA, even if we conclude an agreement that would prevent it from being carried out, the problem remains: the death penalty is counter to our values. Given that, if crimes are committed, there is a hierarchy between US citizens, who cannot be tried before the International Criminal Court, and European citizens, who can be extradited to the USA in order to be tried before the US judiciary, such discrimination is also counter to our principles. The case of the Guantánamo Bay prisoners is the most flagrant illustration of the fact that the USA does not respect fundamental rights, insofar as it has brought these men before special courts and completely violated their right to defence. They are suffering degrading, inhumane treatment, counter to international law and to the universal declaration of human rights. In these conditions, do you truly think it possible for the Union to accept extradition to the USA of any individual, regardless of their nationality? In conclusion, what guarantees do we have that the USA will in fact respect an agreement signed with the Union, when it does not respect its international obligations, ignores international law, and considers itself above the law and entitled to take unilateral decisions as shown in its attack on Iraq?

 Mr President, today, the European Parliament is again taking a position over the Council’s proposal on family reunification. In this connection, we should remember that the Council has already laid down a general approach, on 27 February this year. While the right to live with one’s family is recognised by international conventions and referred to in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it is disgraceful to see that the Council’s approach casts serious doubts over this right for residents from third countries. If we take into consideration the Tampere Summit, which sought to establish a common approach in order to guarantee, in accordance with human rights instruments, the integration of third-country nationals legally resident in the Union, this new approach is a genuine downward adjustment. As certain Members are saying, it is true that this directive is better than nothing when we know of the difficulties encountered to reach this point. But we cannot avoid condemning its minimalist aspect, despite all the goodwill of the rapporteur, whom we sincerely thank for her work. Nevertheless, allow me to make some criticisms. Why exclude people who enjoy temporary protection or subsidiary protection status? Excluded from the asylum system by this proposal, they have become rightless. They are also excluded from all the directives on third-country nationals. Moreover, why restrict family reunification purely to the legal spouse and dependent children under certain circumstances? Nothing justifies making the admission of minors over 12 years old subject to the condition for integration, or excluding minor children over 15 years old. The definition of a third-country national child should be the same as that of another European child. A child is a child. Whatever his nationality, he has the right to live with his parents. This provision appears to run counter to Member States’ international obligations on children’s rights. Such inconsistencies are unjustified and unjustifiable. As regards the length of the procedure, as soon as the application for family reunification is submitted, it must be possible for this to take effect within a reasonable time. A waiting time of three years of marriage is much too long. We do not ask Europeans to have been married for three years before they can live together. Yet the principle of the right to live as a family is simple. When a foreigner legally resident in a Union Member State holds a residence permit valid for one year, the right to family reunification should be automatic. Furthermore, with this restrictive proposal, family life is in danger of becoming an ordeal, especially for women. In actual fact, the directive stipulates that the grant of a residence permit is limited to a period of one year and is renewable under certain circumstances. Now, the permit issued should have the same duration as that of the spouse. The stipulated period of five years before an autonomous residence permit is granted to the spouse is much too long. The lack of legal autonomy often makes women totally dependent on their husbands, which is unacceptable in a Europe that upholds women’s rights. Moreover, given that access to employment for members of the family is not a right from the moment of entry, this forces one of the spouses to bear all the expenses and block any social integration of the other spouse. This proposal for a directive is the result of a philosophy which conflicts with that adopted last year. Not only does it conflict with the talk of integration urged by many of those involved, but it also incites immigrants’ children to violent reactions in the face of the injustice experienced.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the initiative that has been proposed seeks to set out the measures that may be taken by the authorities to provide assistance for the purposes of the removal, with or without escorts, of third-country nationals. This proposal is one of numerous initiatives seeking to combat unorthodox immigration. If the European Union has to have a common immigration and asylum policy and has to provide itself with the means to manage migratory flows, this policy should respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms that are universally recognised and acknowledged by the Member States. This is why we cannot support an approach which seeks to make the deportation of third-country nationals who do not have the right papers a populist tool at the service of a repressive policy on the reality of immigration. Too many expulsions by air have ended in the death of human beings because of the way in which they have been treated. Everyone remembers Semira Adamou, who suffocated in a plane in Belgium while being deported. Last month, again, in France, two other immigrants who did not have the necessary papers died at the hands of the same violence. Recently, on 3 March, France and Germany expelled a group of 54 Senegalese and Ivorians who had not been admitted to these countries, had had their asylum applications dismissed and had been kept in a waiting zone. This sounds to me very much like forced and – at the very least – mass repatriation. Were Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 19 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that was ratified at the Nice Summit, respected? Furthermore, in the Ivorians' case they were sent back to a country where there is currently unrest and civil war. Were the procedures for applying for asylum that are guaranteed by the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees also respected? Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the principle of non-refoulement, that is recognised in asylum law, was fully respected. The security-based approach that is being proposed to us today is entirely in keeping with the Union's practices, which, we have to admit, have not enabled the problem of illegal immigration to be resolved. We urgently need to recognise that the myth of zero immigration and its corollary, the all-repressive approach, are a failure. So far the Member States' repressive immigration policies have not caused a decline in illegal immigration. Quite the opposite: they have reinforced it by breeding more immigrants without the proper papers and they have sent hundreds of thousands of people underground, people who are now in the grip of networks of exploitative criminals, traffickers in human beings and advocates of modern slavery. This failure demands a thorough revision of the immigration and asylum policy. This is a major and complex issue with a great deal at stake in the long term and our democracies have an important responsibility to assume for it. In rejecting a Community policy so as to meet the national demands of the Member States, in putting the rights of migrants and their families at risk, thus handing them over to the violence of deportation, and in refusing to recognise the wealth that these citizens, whether legal or not, bring to the project of European integration, this proposal is based on a philosophy that runs counter to our conviction that Europe should be a place of openness and solidarity, and that is why the Group of the Greens rejects it. We call on the Council to establish a genuine Community asylum and immigration policy that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms. We recommend a European campaign to legalise the situation of all those who do not have papers, who have ties in the host country and who reside there on a long-term basis. We recommend putting an end to the injustice of people being punished twice and sometimes even three times because of the readmission agreements. We urgently need to remedy the contradictory situation of people who can neither be deported nor given legal papers, by finally recognising the right to live in a family. After the minimalist proposal for a directive on family reunification that we examined just now in this House, we can only imagine the kind of discrimination that the European Union intends to reserve for the most marginalised and weak in the future. We are against these practices and assure you that we will remain vigilant and active in our efforts to ensure that all those who reside in Europe can be full citizens and enjoy equal rights. Whatever their nationality or their administrative situation, these people should be treated with the dignity that all human beings deserve.

 Mr President, of course a democratic process is needed in Iraq, but war is never a solution. It is unfair, because it kills innocent people, and, as the Arab proverb says, a killer is never a benefactor. Despite that massive rejection of this war by public opinion, the Council remains silent, whereas we ought to have condemned it. It is simplistic to believe that the objective of the United States is to control energy resources. We must recognise that Bush has succeeded in bringing off a double tour de force
. He has made people forget not only that his country is going through a social and economic crisis, but also that every day the Israeli army of occupation murders dozens of Palestinians. Israel continues to violate international law with complete impunity. The Americanisation of the world, and the re-drawing of the geopolitical map of the Middle East – are not these the real objectives? The European Union must play a vital role in rebuilding peace. It must help to create conditions in which the rights of nations can be respected and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of States can be guaranteed. In order to do this, however, it urgently needs to provide itself with a common foreign and defence policy. The future of Europe depends on it. Do we want to have a Europe of soldiers in the service of an American empire, or a Europe of independent citizens who respect fundamental rights? At the next meeting of the UN Security Council, Member States must take a wide-ranging initiative in order to impose the force of law as against the law of force.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal being examined today is aimed at establishing a harmonised legal framework for the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals. On this subject, it has to be stated that the European Union is still a very weak vessel. We can only regret the hypocrisy of European policies. While all countries see development aid as a means of combating illegal immigration, cooperation budgets are reduced and, with not one bit of responsibility accepted for training, there are no qualms about participating in the brain drain. There is no hesitation in cherry-picking the most promising immigrants, or those who serve our interests. As for the others, the re-admission clauses in the cooperation agreements are used in order all the better to expel those who have no papers but who are already settled in their social and professional lives and participating fully in the construction of Europe. Without a thought for the future of immigrants or their protection or even for the respect of their fundamental rights to health, education and accommodation, the economic and demographic needs of the Member States are satisfied by making use of controlled immigration that is liable to be ruthlessly exploited and manipulated and that mainly serves to make up for the labour shortage and to compensate for the demographic imbalance. Yes, Mrs Terrón i Cusí is right. The immigration issue must be part of an overall, long-term vision of the EU’s policy as a community. In this context, there is good reason for tackling the issues relating to the management of migration flows. These include essential policy on visas, policy on unifying families – particularly in relation to the rights associated with European citizenship – and the new definition of development aid, implying genuine cooperation. Although one of the Tampere conclusions is about ensuring equitable treatment for third-country nationals, this objective proves to be far from having been achieved when closer attention is given not only to the conditions of entry and residence but also to citizens’ rights, particularly freedom of movement, the right to live as part of a family and those rights that should be linked to residence rather than nationality. If European legislation enables workers from third countries to be turned into cheap labour or a kind of cannon fodder on the field of insecure employment, the European Union will lose all the credibility that it has built up over many years through its programmes to combat forms of discrimination, programmes that it is duty-bound to defend on the basis of its ideals of justice and freedom. Everyone knows that a citizens’ Europe cannot be built upon forms of discrimination that give rise to injustice and exclusion and that engender racism. It is therefore our responsibility to work for a humanitarian and Community-based policy on immigration, and one that respects fundamental rights and reaffirms immigration as an opportunity for Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Lebanese civil society is following closely the signature of this association agreement. Although Europe is Lebanon’s main trading partner and one of the important backers supporting its economic modernisation programme, it also guarantees respect for fundamental rights on the road to establishing democratic freedoms. Freedom of expression has once more been seriously attacked, as shown by the enforced closure of the television channel MTV last September for having allowed the opposition to speak at the time of the by-elections. The confirmation of this decision by the courts only serves to increase concerns over this situation. The deregulations of the legal system do not encourage respect for freedom of expression as the courts are increasingly instrumentalised in order to act as means of applying pressure. More than 17 000 people have disappeared since the beginning of the Lebanese war. Ten years after the end of the conflict, no serious enquiry has been carried out to discover what happened to them. Some were probably executed in Lebanon, but no search has been undertaken for the bodies. It also seems that the victims of kidnapping were handed over to Syria and then transferred to Syrian prisons. The association of families was recently received by the Syrian authorities, who promised them an enquiry but have done nothing as yet. The Lebanese authorities, for their part, remain silent. Public opinion is increasingly calling for the total withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon. Their presence, in addition to corruption within the Lebanese political class, contributes to maintaining a climate of instability dominated by a catastrophic economic situation. In order to prevent the democratic clause from being nothing more than a dead letter, it is vital to establish mechanisms for the regular monitoring and assessment of its implementation, from the very entry into force of the agreement, in partnership with the NGOs that are close to daily reality. In this country where fundamental rights and democratic freedoms are often ignored, Lebanon’s people are placing great hope in these agreements as they represent an essential means of pressure for the citizens.

Ladies and gentlemen, the Middle East has a unique heritage, rich in symbols and history. But that heritage, which for too long has undergone the colonial conflict ravaging Palestine, is in danger of disappearing. Many age-old historical centres have been devastated, destroyed by the Israeli occupying forces. In Hebron, the army is preparing to destroy around one hundred houses bordering the prayer route. It is a real corridor, riddled with watchtowers and only accessible to the settlers, which will be developed to link the settlement to the tomb of the patriarchs, the symbol of the three religions, which Israel wishes to appropriate. Hebron is a blatant example of apartheid. The town is separated in two by a large road used only by Israelis, and some streets are entirely forbidden to Palestinians. This is a symbol of a downward spiral that can only lead to an escalation of violence. During the conflict, Palestinian heritage has become a major political issue. The foundations of cultural sites are giving way under the attacks from Israeli tanks and helicopters, which are also battering public and professional buildings, schools, houses and refugee camps, causing thousands of civilian casualties. Is that not true terrorism, military terrorism, state terrorism? Israel is thus clearly showing that a Palestinian identity has no place in its plans to extend the settlements. This idea of eradicating the history and memory of the Palestinian people is a result of the Israeli State’s quest for legitimacy. I would also like to commend the courage of civilian and international missions, which with no power to intervene but the right to report and observe, are playing a moderating and protective role. Through their action on the ground, they are carrying out citizen’s diplomacy where our international diplomacy is unable to intervene. We must urgently condemn what are genuine crimes against humanity’s shared cultural heritage, demand that the Hague conventions and Geneva conventions on the protection of goods and persons be respected and ask the Commission to call on the UN Security Council to send an intervention force to protect the Palestinian people, their cultural and historical heritage and their environment. Let us remember that fair and sustainable peace for these two populations can only be based on respect for international law, the withdrawal of settlements and occupation forces and the creation of a Palestinian State within the 1967 borders.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the readmission agreements that the Council is proposing stem more from a strategy for combating illegal immigration than from genuine cooperation. Allow me to stress two points. As far as the procedure is concerned, the lack of information given to Parliament raises the issue of the role and powers of parliamentarians: it is our democratic credibility that is at stake. We complain about the rate of abstention, about the fact that Europe is an unknown entity to the citizens, we want to convince citizens of the need for the Union, but, as long as their representatives are scorned and are not consulted, we cannot make the Europe of the citizen that we want to build credible. With regard to the readmission clauses, the Union reaffirmed its commitment to the Geneva and Dublin Conventions at the Tampere Summit. It is therefore unacceptable that these readmission agreements can make it possible to send back third country nationals when there is no guarantee that human rights and democratic freedoms will be respected in their country of origin. What criteria are applied in order to verify that a country to which a national is being returned is safe? The European Union is basing its policy on respect for fundamental rights. This applies, in particular, to the measures which regulate the movement of individuals, and especially to the measures relating to voluntary or forced return. How does the Commission intend to verify that these rights are respected in case of return, particularly when it is a question of mass returns? These issues are real issues. Today, Afghans may be returned to Afghanistan despite the fact that there is no guarantee of their safety and of peace in the region. The closure of Sangatte has provided no solution to the problem of accepting refugees; Kurds and Iraqis continue to arrive every day. Are the readmission agreements compatible with the obligations under international law, do they respect the principle of ‘non-refoulement’, on which the right to seek asylum depends? What common control mechanisms does the Commission intend to put in place with the countries with which these agreements are negotiated? We should like to have been reassured that these fundamental rights are being respected. In spite of the quality of the work of our rapporteur, we have no guarantee regarding these questions that are fundamental for our freedoms and our rights. The readmission clauses provide a response to the concerns regarding the interests of the countries of the Union instead of assisting the development of third countries. They are harmful to any Community immigration and asylum policy; we are therefore unable to support them.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though many people have spoken out against a war in Iraq, the United States are continuing their threats with new demands, on the pretext of combating terrorism. Calls for American national unity have not been able to mask the social and economic difficulties there, its crisis of political confidence and its restrictions of democratic freedom, which are condemned by many American citizens. We are all aware, beyond the undeniable arguments concerning the reality of Saddam Hussein’s power, supported thus far by Westerners, that one of the main targets of this war is oil. Such a war would also allow other objectives to be targeted, such as strengthening the direct hold over oil and gas resources in the Middle East, in order to kick-start growth in the United States, strike a blow to OPEC, one of Washington’s pet hates, and weaken the Arab world, depriving it of any possible political opposition force. Furthermore, we cannot ignore the matter of the current context of the whole region. This war can only destroy the United Nations’ efforts to consolidate international law in favour of fair, lasting peace. We know it will have further tragic consequences for the Palestinian people. This is borne out by Ariel Sharon’s stated support for Bush, for whom the international situation represents an opportunity to strike further blows against the Palestinian resistance. Moreover, commencing military action in this region will set the Arab world ablaze, plunge the people into decades of poverty, and send weakened political regimes into the arms of fundamentalism. Do not think that our continent will be spared by this war. Europe will be the first target for terrorism and will be a breeding ground for tension, and racism and islamophobia will only increase. It is not too late to prevent this war. To do so, people everywhere, as widely as possible, must express their rejection of the US unilateral policy and it is time for the European Union to shoulder its responsibilities, and forcefully and vigorously restate its commitment to peace, the reason for its construction. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again we have reason to discuss EU asylum policy; unfortunately it is under the banner of security. In fact, what we have to do today is examine two Commission documents which, due to their nature, scope and objectives, should not be considered together, unless we want to cause confusion. This joint consideration of two equally important and sensitive dossiers gives the impression that asylum seekers are potential terrorists. The Commission, however, clearly states in its report that it is unlikely that terrorists would ask to exercise the right to asylum. This is a true paradox. The Member States are in fact trying to escape their international commitments by invoking exclusion clauses where a loose interpretation of these clauses would free them from their commitments, even though these commitments are fundamental with regard to human rights. Given all the difficulties posed by the subject of asylum, and despite all our differences, we must not forget that we are dealing with victims, not with criminals. Only an integrated approach and restrictive application of exclusion clauses can guarantee compliance with the Member States’ international obligations with regard to asylum. Return, expulsion and extradition policies must provide every possible guarantee of respect for human rights, in particular when these people face the death penalty in their country of origin, as well as the social and domestic situation of each country. Do we have the right to send people to countries where civil war is raging, or where there is a daily risk of death in addition to economic and social misery, such as in Algeria or other countries? Non-expulsion is, however, required by the European Union in our association agreements. Extradition implicitly jeopardises the right of every individual to seek asylum when their life is threatened. A European solution must also be found with regard to asylum seekers deprived of the right of asylum, who find themselves without any rights and further swell the ranks of illegal immigrants exploited by unscrupulous employers for their own gain, while these people live in inhumane conditions within our European democracies. These men and women have waited such a long time to receive a response from the authorities that they have often formed strong links with the country they are in, having children there, for example, and their links with their country of origin have often become weaker or non-existent. Expelling them would therefore uproot them once again. The only solution now would be to legalise their presence. I would simply like to make these few points in order to ensure universal respect for fundamental rights, but I support the rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against racism and xenophobia is not a new concern of our institutions. On numerous occasions, the debates in our Assembly have focused on combating racism. Today we have a European monitoring centre as well as Article 13 of the Treaty, which enshrines the power of the Union to take action to combat discrimination. The European countries also have national anti-racism legislation. In practice, however, racial discrimination has never before been such an acute problem. Let me cite in evidence the report produced by the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia, which testifies to the upsurge in racism and xenophobia, including ‘Islamophobia’, a phenomenon reflected in the alarming rise of the extreme right. The Council’s proposal on combating racism and xenophobia, which we are examining here, is designed to strengthen and supplement the existing legal framework. It is highly regrettable, however, to discover once again that Community responsibility for defining and penalising racist and xenophobic crimes is to be based on the lowest common denominator. If there is no common definition of the recognised offences, how will it be possible to guarantee that the same efforts will be made to combat racism and xenophobia in each of the Member States? One might well ask whether the aim of this proposal is really to combat racism or whether it is merely a way of salving our consciences. This reluctance to take the bull by the horns is tantamount to offering racists the right to continue serving the ends of the extreme right or engaging in populism and rabble-rousing sophistry for electoral purposes and to do so with impunity. Let us not forget that the purpose of combating racism is not only to protect foreigners but also to defend the values of our democracies, human rights and fundamental freedoms, which form the bedrock on which we are building the European Union. Besides, why exclude the Member States from the implementation of this Decision when we know for a fact that institutional racism exists and that it must be combated with the utmost vigour? This institutional racism, which manifests itself in a whole host of social, economic, professional, cultural and political exclusion mechanisms, is based on ethnic or religious considerations or sometimes on a system of national preference, which is now giving way to European preference. If racism is to be combated more effectively on a day-to-day basis, it is not enough to adopt legislative acts. We are convinced that granting equal rights, including political rights, to all citizens of the Union, whatever their nationality, is the only way to combat every form of racism, because it establishes a balance of political power that is rooted in the exercise of citizenship. Unfortunately, the proposed framework decision does not go far enough in this direction. Nevertheless, we owe it to ourselves to support every initiative that puts human dignity at the heart of the process of building the Union, and combating racism is an integral part of that process.

 High Representative, along with other Members of the House, we went to celebrate Europe Day in Jerusalem, to celebrate a day of peace. We met the Israeli and Palestinian political leaders as well as NGOs. Words cannot, of course, express the atrocity of the massacres, but I would prefer to pass on to you the message that they gave to us. If the European Union wishes to remain true to the values that it defends, it must urgently demand the withdrawal from the occupied territories and the recognition of Palestinian State, reaffirming the 1967 borders, which requires the breaking up of settlements, the boycotting of products from these settlements and sending an international peacekeeping force to guarantee the protection of the people. On Saturday 11 May, more than 70 000 Israeli citizens gathered in Tel Aviv to show their support for peace. This gathering shows us that we need to go further than humanitarian discussions and to start to take action. The European Parliament shouldered its responsibilities by adopting resolutions. These are not designed to give it a clear conscience and they must not be forgotten. It is now up to the Council, as it alone can give force and vigour to our resolution, to agree to implement them. As you know, the European citizens working on the ground form an effective force for peace. They have been a constant presence by willingly forming a human shield. I formally appeal to you to be worthy of these citizens: would the international conference not give us the opportunity to recognise the Palestinian State alongside the Israeli State? This recognition would give confidence to the Palestinians and could set in motion genuine reform of the institutions of the Palestinian Authority.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I returned yesterday from Palestine and I would like to take two minutes to give you an account of my visit. Words cannot express the horror of the situation or the atrocities suffered by the people of Palestine who are denied the most fundamental rights. The hospital in Ramallah has been surrounded and the clinics are inundated by the number of people who are seriously injured. All the hospital buildings have been destroyed. Women are dying in childbirth, their babies too. Ambulances drive round under a hail of bullets to rescue the injured and to collect the dead that they are unable to bury. A single pit has been dug in the hospital yard so that the bodies can be piled into it. A child crossing the road was hit by a bullet which paralysed him for life. An old lady went outside to fill a saucepan with water in the yard, was hit by a bullet and was killed instantly. An ill man, leaning on his walking stick for support, who came to be treated for diabetes, was killed by a bullet as he climbed up the first step into the hospital. When we arrived at Yasser Arafat’s headquarters to bring him food and water, a tank pointed its gun at us. The soldiers, maintaining the firing position, forced us to retreat. In the light of these threats, we left taking the supplies with us. Are these children, these elderly people and these women, terrorists who are putting the state and people of Israel at risk? There is also a curfew in force in Bethlehem. We were there on Sunday, the day of universal prayer. There was the sound of constant gunfire. We decided to accompany worshippers to church. Tanks were positioned at the bottom of the steps in Nativity Square blocking all access to the church. The soldiers ordered us to leave immediately, threatening to shoot us. We went back up a narrow pathway, past churches and schools that had been destroyed. We walked through ruins, past smashed up and burnt out cars, the rubble from collapsed houses and smashed pavements. Torrents of filthy water spewed out of crushed pipe work. Drinking water supplies stored on roofs were practically empty, meaning the inhabitants will soon be without water. They are already without electricity. At the corner of a house, we were again surrounded by soldiers who pointed their rifles at us. You must be aware that our parliamentary delegation entered these towns secretly, using winding dirt tracks, through quarries and building sites, to hide from patrols, patrols of soldiers. When they saw us, people of all ages came out to speak to us, to plead with us to intervene urgently. They expect so much from Europe. They are pinning all their hopes on us. They told us that they would never abandon Yasser Arafat, the person that they consider to be their only legitimate representative, despite the criticism that has been made of him. As democratically elected representatives waving the white flag, we hid like terrorists to assist and protect these people who are victims of terrorist acts. Yes, it is war, but not a war of religion. No, it is a colonial war, where people are resisting military occupation and a state which continues, with utter impunity, to breach international law and the right to live. In the birthplace of cultures and civilisations, universal values and human dignity are being treated with contempt and humanity is collapsing. We do not have the right to remain silent and we cannot say, in the future, that we did not know what was happening. We must face up to our responsibilities and make every effort to bring an immediate end to this massacre. We must make some genuine proposals. You must make some genuine proposals, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, Minister, to bring about a political solution. If we vote in favour of suspending the Association Agreements, declare an embargo on arms exports to Israel and send a peacekeeping force urgently to protect the Palestinian people, we will be taking practical action to restore peace and security in these two states. We will also be taking action to promote peace for all the peoples of Israel and Palestine, for the entire region and the world. We will be reaffirming that a future and prosperity cannot be achieved by disregarding justice and the law. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for making your own contribution to peace by supporting this resolution. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we naturally welcome the proposal for a Council directive which is totally in line with the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere conclusions, which stressed the need to finally put in place a policy for integrating third-country nationals. Having said that, we could not support the report. We regret that the proposal does nothing more than set out the conditions governing the residence of third-country nationals and that it does not, in any shape or form, establish a genuine European status for third-country nationals comparable to that of EU citizens. By the same token, family members must enjoy the same rights as the person they are joining. Yet, the way in which it is presented in the report, the right to live a normal family life, which is internationally recognised, does not take into account certain fundamental laws. Although the right to vote was, in principle, adopted in part, the conditions of application are not mentioned. Political rights are, however, an integral part of any integration policy. Fundamental rights are universal and if the universality of rights must be applied without exception, it should also apply to everyone, whether or not they are EU citizens. As for the criteria regarding resources and evaluating the stability of resources, would it not be better to offer all residents access to the labour market, rather than to confine some of them to exclusion? Furthermore, there is no reason why students or persons that have been granted residence with subsidiary protection should be excluded from the scope of the proposal. Firstly, however, the concepts of public order and security, which are reasons for excluding persons from permanent status, require a common definition. Yet these concepts are now left to the discretion of the States or the competent authorities, which gives rise to serious discrimination, particularly towards third-country nationals. Lastly, with regard to procedures, the examination process takes six months, which is far too long. If the application is refused, a redress period, which does not exist, should be provided and this must have a suspensory effect, enabling any attempt at the expulsion of the person to be blocked, in the name of the right to self-defence. My final point is that the directive does not cover the millions of third-country nationals who are residing illegally, but who urgently need a political solution from Europe. The Union must therefore shoulder its responsibilities. To sum up, this report does not promote equality between citizens of the Union and citizens of third countries. The European status of a long-term resident does not exist. We must not therefore sanction this type of political approach.

Ladies and gentlemen, the conclusions of the Tampere Summit have given new impetus to the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice. With a view to attaining the objectives that were set, a plan of action was drawn up, which provides for its establishment between two and five years after the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force. It is now time for a mid-term review of the progress made on the Tampere agenda, in the light of the Commission’s timetable. The area of security, freedom and justice covers three major aspects: the Community’s asylum and immigration policy, strengthening judicial cooperation and police cooperation. So let us look at the situation regarding each of these three aspects. On the question of asylum and immigration policy and, more specifically, the management of migration flows, under the measures that have been taken, immigration is regarded as a palliative for manpower shortages and as compensation for the demographic imbalances of the states involved, without taking account of the human or social dimension or the consequences of the brain drain. However, surely this Community migration policy calls into question the universal nature of fundamental rights? Is the re-admission policy consistent with international obligations regarding the protection of refugees and the right of asylum? As for the European Observatory on Migration, I have a reservation. Surely we have to admit that first of all we need to reflect on its purpose, its usefulness and the position of the NGOs concerned with migration in this Observatory. Not a single significant measure has been taken to ensure that third-country nationals are treated fairly. As for their political participation and the re-definition of citizenship, this question has been evaded on the pretext of protecting national sovereignty, which comes down to denying the democratic rights of citizens resident in Europe. How does the Commission propose to promote citizenship based on residence as a means of ensuring their rights? Furthermore, what action does the Council propose to take on the directives on reuniting families, on the status of non-Europeans who are long-term residents and on freedom of movement, establishment and work on the territory of the Member States? The Geneva Convention forms the basis of asylum policy. However, the concept of refugee must encompass both the gender aspect and the social aspect. Is the Council prepared to respond to the specific sufferings of women and victims of civil war? Surely the Eurodac system, based on a data bank of fingerprints, presents a risk to asylum seekers? Furthermore, should the Dublin Convention not be reviewed? The competence of a state to examine a file and the decision-making responsibility should be decided on the basis of the asylum seeker’s choice of country of residence rather than by the country of arrival, which is so difficult to decide in a Union that has supposedly abolished borders. The action plans adopted for partnership with third countries are looking more and more like a means of holding back immigration. What is the situation regarding development aid, a corollary to restricting emigration? Has cooperation been reduced to financing extradition? Surely the introduction of administrative police at the points of entry from third countries is a negation of the right to seek asylum? Some progress has been made at civil level, in relation to strengthening judicial cooperation. Several texts have been adopted on judicial powers, the notification of acts, the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and their enforcement, especially in the matrimonial field and in relation to parental responsibility. A proposal for a directive on legal aid is under consideration; it aims to secure better access to justice. The situation is much less promising with regard to reinforcing criminal judicial cooperation: the reservations here are mainly about what constitutes a specific offence. In the legislative field, framework decisions have been taken on protecting the euro against forgeries, money-laundering, combating the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children. The Council also appears to be preparing to adopt those decisions that concern the fight against terrorism and the European arrest warrant. The slow progress is due mainly to Member States’ resistance to the principle of mutual recognition. The setting up of Eurojust is a real step forward for the citizens; the rights of defendants and the protection of data do, however, need better guarantees. Unfortunately, we find that we are still far from establishing a European public prosecutor’s office or from common legislation and judicial procedures. We find the most marked progress in the field of police cooperation. There are now many areas where the police have to cooperate. The procedures for Europol’s participation in joint investigations, for the keeping of its records and for its cooperation with third countries need to be clearly defined. Surely we urgently need to guarantee better data protection and finally ensure that we have democratic and judicial scrutiny? As for respect for fundamental rights, I believe we need to review the list of safe countries. Turning to the Schengen Information System, and looking ahead to the enlargement of the Union, new questions arise concerning its tasks, its technical capacity and its institutional form. We must not overlook the external dimension of justice and home affairs. The fight against trafficking in human beings and the fight against organised crime are both areas that should be dealt with under the external relations aspect of justice and home affairs.

Madam President, as we are talking about human rights, I would like to speak on an issue of method, which applies to all the association agreements. Today, a joint debate is going to take place on the association agreements with Egypt, and it will include oral questions and motions for resolutions. For the sake of a democratic debate and a more coherent vote on all the association agreements, it is important for it to be split into separate parts. We suggest that the debate should deal, first of all, with oral questions and resolutions and then, secondly, with the vote on the association agreements. It is neither logical nor coherent to take a position on these issues at the same time. The oral questions and resolutions are intended to question the political powers of these countries and to give them time to debate and respond to those questions. This two-part method allows us to confirm the fundamental importance that we attach to the whole agreement, particularly Article 2 on human rights. The example of Egypt is telling in that it shows that we do not silently accept a decision that constitutes a violation of human rights, the recent condemnation of homosexuals, and flouts the values that we defend in Article 2 of our agreements. Our group would therefore like to keep the debate and vote on oral questions and motions for resolutions in one part-session, and put the association agreements back to another part-session. We have already made a request to that effect by letter to the President.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against terrorism is an absolute necessity, the legitimacy of which should not be questioned or we could see our democracies collapse. However, under no circumstances should it serve as a pretext for gagging our fundamental rights and democratic freedoms. How can we justify a European proposal to combat terrorism if no added value can be gained from it? Under the current legislation of the Member States, perpetrators of attacks could not go unpunished. As the public enemy number one is terrorism, why not limit the European arrest warrant to terrorist offences? If the illegal capture of State or government facilities, public modes of transport, infrastructures or public places constitutes a terrorist offence or if the legitimate expression of our freedoms of expression and association, our trade union rights, could, in the future, be criminalised or described as terrorism, if those elements are retained, by voting in favour of these reports we will be renouncing all of our democratic rights. An explicit guarantee of these rights and freedoms must be included in this proposal for a framework directive. Our fears also extend to certain offences that could fall under the warrant, as the criterion used is that of the sentence, while the accused persons may deserve protection, for example if they are migrants or asylum seekers. Even those giving support to those people would, in the future, become guilty of terrorism. A minimum degree of harmonisation of Member States’ criminal procedures is necessary in order to safeguard the principle of equality before the law and guarantee the protection of rights in the principle of collegiality. Furthermore, as minors cannot be the subjects of an arrest warrant, their description for criminal purposes also needs to be harmonised. If we are to establish an area of security, freedom and justice, these three dimensions need to be fully effective. Unfortunately, we observe that the security aspect is dominating the policies of the Union and the Member States. The fight against terrorism needs to be reflected in security for all residents, without exception and in total respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Finally, if a new text has to be adopted by the Council in the future, we hope that this House will be consulted once again.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the proposed signing of an association agreement between the European Union and Egypt, which will help to strengthen the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. The European Union attaches great importance to the chapter on fundamental rights and freedoms. We should only sign this agreement on condition that these rights will be respected strictly. Since 1981, Egypt has been subject to an emergency law granting wide powers to the authorities, to the detriment of human rights and democratic freedoms. Today, these so-called freedoms are regulated and are subject to strict control by the authorities. The valuable work undertaken by NGOs has alerted us to this matter. We call upon the government of Egypt to repeal this emergency law, so men and women can enjoy all their rights. This would mean that people would not be criminalised on the grounds of their sexual orientation, their religion or their opinion. We will not remain silent on the decision to take legal action against homosexuals, which constitutes a violation of human rights which goes completely against the values we hold dear. We must not interfere, we must not claim that our values are superior, we must not preach but we must denounce and condemn. Human rights are universal and transcend all borders.

First of all, I must admit that this explanation of vote is difficult. Like everybody else we are appalled by the attacks that took place on 11 September. It is frustrating to decide not to use additional means to fight those who committed them. We are, however, convinced that it is a choice governed by reason, and not by an instinctive reaction, which is legitimate but dangerous, motivated by anger and pain. Apart from the fact that we refuse to set a precedent on urgent procedures, which could then dramatically increase, we have questions regarding the list proposed in the annex, which reveals genuine and fundamental problems. Of course, we are in total agreement with the principle of implementing specific measures against people and goods linked to terrorism, in order to fight it more effectively. There are too many areas of doubt in this well-known list: – How can we support it when we do not even know how it was put together? – On what criteria were these people selected? We know that there is no definition of terrorism in international law, and that it is therefore impossible to set out objective criteria for what constitutes belonging to a terrorist movement. All that is needed is to observe how easily some people call any behaviour that goes against prevailing thought ‘terrorism’, such as is the case with the anti-globalisation activists or those who are against NGOs, in order to be worried about possible confusions. Moreover, what about certain general legal principles such as: – Presumption of innocence? Benefit of the doubt? – And who has the burden of proof?

 Mr President, when a Community competence in immigration and asylum was enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam it certainly raised hopes, chief among them that of seeing a policy on immigration and asylum founded on values associated with democratic freedoms and respect for human rights, especially fundamental rights. In this respect, we welcome the two Commission communications, which examine these complex issues in great depth. Thus, instead of ineffective, inappropriate immigration policies which make illegal immigration an inherent part of the system, they propose a flexible approach with provisions for managing flows and integrating third-country nationals. It is regrettable that our rapporteur on immigration should have focused on exploiting the management of migratory flows for the economic and demographic ends of the countries in the Union, without showing concern for the human factor. To implement these proposals on an intergovernmental basis, as Mr Pirker wishes, would not only be a step backwards compared with the Treaty of Amsterdam; it would also show contempt for the need to make immigration and asylum policy a Community instrument and above all it would be a refusal to recognise what is really happening on the ground, which can be seen every day at Sangatte and elsewhere. Furthermore, we urgently need to correct the misconception that, ‘immigration equals workers’. The notion of a ‘migrant worker’ does not actually take account of what really happens when people immigrate with members of their family, including students or retired people. Let us remember that the right to live as part of a family is a fundamental right which no country can deny. There is therefore a strong case in favour of talking about 'residents' and – why not – ‘European citizens’, assuming that they participate fully. It is the Member States’ duty to take the necessary measures to ensure that all European residents are fully integrated; they achieve this by making sure that everyone has the same rights, including political ones. As far as illegal immigrants are concerned, the only solution that we know of is for the Member States to be responsible for legalising their situation so as to combat all forms of crime, including that committed by traffickers and unscrupulous employers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, participation in the World Conference in Durban was important, as a solemn proclamation of the renewal of an alliance against discrimination and the rejection of respect for human rights, and above all as an opportunity for reconciliation, the only way to reconstruct the future and future peace. As the Minister has already said, the objective of this conference was obvious, its scope was complex, and it was necessary in order to construct the future. At the same time, the NGO forum was held. Although the final declaration appears to be excessive, it merely reveals, not a split, but a great deal of diversity among the NGOs. Noticeable, in fact, is the absence of the worldwide NGOs, and the virtual absence of the NGOs involved in immigration in Europe. The only NGOs featured in the declaration are the antiracist NGOs and the solidarity NGOs. On the other hand, the dynamism of the international NGOs is also noticeable, in the way they challenge power, assert principles, or, then again, consolidate a power already in place, hence in some cases their lobbying activities and their nickname of VGOs (Voluntary Government Organisations). Yet within this diversity there is a certain amount of logic, the logic of powerful people. On the one hand there is the logic emanating from the rich, developed countries, the former colonisers, and then there is the logic of the poor countries, the ones who were formerly colonised, where power remains to this day hardly what one could call democratic, yet all too often still enjoys the North’s approval. Words have meaning. We have to find the right words to provide a solution. The essential question is that of defining the terminology: slavery, colonialism, racism, genocide, apartheid or military occupation. All these words tell of daily crises, the consequences, moreover, of discrimination. We find that the final text talks of remorse and regrets, but refuses to give any excuses, and still less to envisage the prospect of reparations, or to reaffirm people’s right to live in peace and equality, without having to have recourse to international law. Finally, it is perhaps regrettable that the final declaration is a minimalist declaration which seeks to satisfy everyone by preserving a certain amount of equilibrium. This declaration not only calls into question the credibility and effectiveness of major international meetings, but also raises the question of direct democracy, because in effect it raises the issue of how representative the limits of participative democracy really are. I should like to make one final reference to this so-called hijacking of the conference. Who was hijacking whom? Why? For what purpose? Remember that the United States did not want to take part in this meeting, and that they often threatened to withdraw. The NGOs’ declaration, however hard it might have been, was a good pretext for avoiding any issues with a bearing on the major interests which it was not thought desirable to offend, as well as the issue of reparations. Several countries, including European countries, were secretly relieved to see the conference focus on the Middle East question, which allowed them to dodge the issue of excuses and to put off dealing with the colonial debt. Do not forget that the rich countries of the North built their prosperity on the negro slave trade and on colonial conquest, and they are not all willing to recognise this fully or to make reparation for their past crimes. Moreover, these issues of discrimination against women, children, homosexuals and migrants, and the continued existence of modern slavery, still affect a number of countries which pursue a policy of repression and refuse to allow themselves to be put in the dock. Those powers are still, all too often, supported, and they too prefer to focus on an issue such as that of the Middle East, where they can make a good impression, rather than be called to account for the human rights situation in their own countries. Finally, the essential objective of this conference was achieved, but we must now hope that there will be real follow-up action enabling projects, guidelines and action programmes to be set up and put into practice, with a view to preventing and abolishing those situations in which discrimination occurs, thereby ensuring that our fine words are finally translated into reality.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our objective is to develop the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice within which citizens’ rights are respected and the free movement of persons is guaranteed. However, for over 20 years now, association activists and many elected representatives have been advocating a citizens’ Europe that demonstrates solidarity and is open not only to goods and capital but also and above all to persons. For one brief moment, we had faith in the hope that was born in Schengen, a hope that was virtually suffocated at birth by intolerance, a failure of courage and a lack of calm political analysis. If Schengen represents a considerable step forward for Europe because of the progress made in certain areas, including police and judicial cooperation, it has to be said now that this step forward is a halting and discriminatory one. Although the Schengen Convention has come into force in its entirety in several Member States, there are still inequalities that affect persons who do not hold a European nationality or have the necessary papers, although certain persons or members of their family may have lived in Europe for very many years. Some Member States do not grant the same rights to everyone resident in their country, even if they all accept the same responsibilities. On top of this, we have an immigration and asylum policy that varies from one country to another, differing procedures and controls and repressive police practices leading to dramatic situations in human terms such as those we are now witnessing at Sangatte in the north of France. At the very heart of Europe, in the Channel Tunnel, thousands of men, women and children are risking their lives every day in an attempt to enter the United Kingdom. These people, while awaiting their journey, are concentrated in a reception centre in humanely unacceptable conditions supported only by humanitarian organisations without any power or means at their disposal, such as the Red Cross. These practices bring back some bitter memories. The political authorities still treat refugees and asylum-seekers with coldness, hypocrisy and intolerance. This is unacceptable in the wake of the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Just imagine that police officers have even dared to fire real bullets at asylum seekers! In fact you do not have to imagine it, because other police forces in Europe have already done it. These facts are continuing to discredit our parliaments in the eyes of thousands of members of the public who are calling for a halt to inequality, to injustice and to a Fortress Europe policy. For these reasons, we will be voting against this report, which overlooks all these facts and fails to offer any alternative. Instead, we should act together, as a matter of urgency, to find concrete and equitable solutions to all these dramatic situations, and in particular to the sufferings of the refugees at Sangatte, and to the cries of distress from all those who come to Europe seeking asylum and help.

 Ladies and gentlemen, even though the adoption last year, in Nice, of the Charter of Fundamental Rights represented a step forward for human rights in the European Union, it constitutes only a minimum standard for the protection to which every citizen is entitled. Unfortunately it is still inadequate to combat the distress suffered by thousands of individuals, whether they are refugees, immigrants or illegal immigrants, in particular where women and children are concerned. At no time are the countries concerned, whether European or not, called to order or condemned for the violations that they have committed. Proof of this lies in the reports that have been tabled here today. However good they may be, and for that we can thank the rapporteurs, they still do nothing more than list the many cases in which fundamental rights are giving cause for concern. Human rights and fundamental liberties are universal and inseparable. They must not recognise any boundaries, whether of nationality or of gender. We must reaffirm this argument, strongly and vigorously These rights will only become a reality if everyone is aware of their existence, but also only if everyone has confidence in those who are responsible for applying and respecting them. It is therefore essential to enforce those rights, but also to make them visible and accessible to everyone. If we are to be constructive, we must set up a dialogue with all those involved in the recognition, promotion and defence of fundamental rights, particularly those who are closest to the least-favoured individuals, those who are the victims of discrimination. Another key factor lies in ratifying international instruments and translating them into everyday life: the right to move around freely, to live with one’s family, to be a citizen. Whatever a society is like, it can only flourish in peace, and there can be no peace without justice. Apart from these generalised speeches in favour of human rights, nothing will happen without the political will to achieve real equality of rights for all men and women who have a share in wealth and in the construction of Europe and European citizenship. Instead of fussing about the structures that the European Parliament might give itself in the future, we ought to equip ourselves with the means to ensure that human rights and fundamental liberties are respected, including social and political rights, without which the principles of a state under the rule of law and of democracy will no longer have any meaning.

 The human rights situation in Egypt is giving rise to increasing concern. As other Members have told you, the suffering that Mrs Nawal El Saadawi is having to endure is edifying and it has also been said today that she will soon have to appear before a criminal court and risks imprisonment and a forced divorce. Several other human rights defenders are also experiencing legislative and judicial harassment. The state of emergency, the law on association and the judicial system have been put in place to repress all freedom of expression, which reveals how far off course the government is with regard to respect for human rights, especially where torture and ill treatment are concerned. As for the torturers, they continue their ruthless acts with total impunity. The government does not respect the obligations of international law or the international undertakings given over recent years, including Article 2 of the Association Agreement concluded with the European Union. It is therefore vital that the Egyptian authorities condemn all these expressions of violence and ensure the protection of its citizens. It must implement real measures, especially on behalf of women, minors and prisoners. It must guarantee an independent system of justice with investigations and inspections and renounce any legislation which restricts freedom of expression and association. It must not enforce a state of emergency whenever it wishes to restrain democratic freedoms and the activities of all these human rights campaigners.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, faced with the continual increase in organised crime, the European Union has stepped up its initiatives to reinforce the fight against criminal organisations and improve cooperation between investigating and prosecuting authorities. The Tampere Summit provided new perspectives for this cooperation between police and judiciary, long regarded as the poor relation of European unification. Eurojust, made up of public prosecutors, magistrates and police liaison officers, has become the object of everyone’s attention. How, though, can we envisage effective operation of a unit which could become the future European public prosecutor’s office without prior harmonisation of Member States’ legislation and a basic rapprochement of their procedures? The purpose, for the Member States, is surely to achieve the highest possible standards, at the same time providing sufficient procedural guarantees and effective justice for all citizens, while respecting human rights, including the right to a defence. Yet, we have to recognise that today we are dealing with a body which is not subject to any European Parliament control. More serious still is the lack of all jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, in accordance with Article 35 of the Treaty. Another point to bear in mind concerns the processing of the data that the unit is responsible for. Eurojust will also have the task of collating information from police records, police reports and Member States’ registers. This gives rise to a few questions. What protection will be provided for this information? Who can access and use it? What right of reply and defence, indeed of correction of incorrect or out-of-date data is there? That is the purpose of my amendments, on which our support for this report will depend. It is true, the European Union needs a supranational judicial structure to coordinate and enhance public action across the whole of European Union territory. The stakes are as high as they can be. That presupposes a willingness to implement a common crime policy which will go hand in hand with a minimum of national sovereignty being abandoned, whether the Member States want it or not. Eurojust is about giving Europol a real judicial partner. Its whole effectiveness will depend on the complementarity of the added value that the unit will be capable of bringing to the other players in the judicial and police worlds. So, what use is it to establish supranational structures? Why ensure complex coordination between different countries to centralise an investigation if the judge in charge of the case does not have the resources to complete his investigation or secure conviction of the people charged? To sum up, rather than having an endless epilogue on the possible powers of a real European party, surely it would be better to make a real decision on a structure which would distinguish itself by its rapidity, effectiveness, and availability to the citizens of Europe while giving them full guarantees.

Mr President, during the night of 31 March, another ship carrying illegal immigrants ran aground to the north-east of Athens, just like the Kurdish refugees on 18 February off the coast of Var, in France. These are not national problems. Regularly, in Gibraltar, at Calais and elsewhere, refugees are coming ashore at European ports. They risk their lives to flee from dictatorships, conflict and misery. However, they are likely to end up as illegal immigrants, and they know it. One only has to look at France, where 94% of applications for asylum are rejected. Yet the right of asylum is a fundamental and inalienable right. There is a European fund to provide support for the consequences of receiving these people here. In order to improve efficiency, is the Council thinking of assessing the use of resources from this fund? Acting at European level means more than merely denouncing and condemning those who trade in human misery: as you have pointed out, Mrs Ludford, only an overall solution will deal with these problems, with the emphasis on a foreign policy of cooperation just as much as on a genuine policy of integration which recognises the equality of the rights of all citizens. Does the Council therefore not think that as a matter of urgency the Union should provide itself with an effective statutory instrument in the form of a framework directive which would enable it to regularise the position of all illegal immigrants, in order to adopt a more realistic and humane attitude towards immigration. At the present time, two mechanisms are being studied... (The President cut the speaker off)

 In a world of increasingly open borders, the flood of refugees is not about to dry up. Those who welcome the progress of globalisation but wish to add a social dimension to its economic component must not forget that the movement of goods also means the movement of people. The arrival on the French coast on 19 January of a group of 910 Kurdish refugees clearly illustrates the growing involvement of networks of organised crime in illegal immigration. Above all, however, this massive influx of refugees quite plainly raises the question of the right to seek asylum on European soil today. It highlights the existence right inside our borders of real trafficking in human beings, which, according to some experts, is approaching the scale of the traffic in drugs. This can be discouraged only by the establishment of genuine channels of legal access to immigration. The organisation of legal immigration channels in Europe would tangibly reduce the pressure put on the right of asylum by the fact that it is really the only one that exists, together with the right of persons persecuted in their country of origin to be reunited with their family. Under the 1951 Geneva Convention, the right to seek asylum is indeed a fundamental and inalienable individual right that needs to be strengthened and protected from any political considerations. It needs to be strengthened because refugees face more than just state persecution and because very often it is not just individuals who are targeted but whole families. The proposal before us today seems to tend broadly in that direction, yet the measures it advocates are very limited in terms of achieving the objectives involved in implementing a genuine common European asylum system. It is time Europe considered establishing a legal status of temporary protection for people who flee their country because of war or other crises. It must be a status that does not bar them from access to an asylum procedure and a status that maintains due regard for the principle of non-refoulement enshrined in the Geneva Convention, under which refugees may not be sent back to their country of origin. It is time for the European Union to genuinely overhaul the right of asylum without further delay, for the situations in which the displaced people find themselves are too urgent and serious to allow time for institutional discussions.

 The initiative before us today concerns the enforcement of national, administrative expulsion measures against foreigners, even where they have since moved to another Member State. The purpose of this proposal is, quite patently, to make it easier to take measures to expel third-country nationals. To that end, it introduces an instrument for the mutual recognition of these decisions. Accordingly, an expulsion decision taken in one Member State can be enforced in another. At first sight it may seem quite laudable to try to regulate and control the movement of foreigners whom our Member States have decided to expel. This would be in line with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council of October 1999, aimed at better migration management. Careful examination, however, soon shows up the total ambiguity and imprecise nature of this initiative and the legal loopholes it contains. Now that it is high time the European Union countries adopted a genuine immigration policy, what are we to think of a document that not only does not regulate expulsion issues at all, but which also seems to show complete disregard for the real situations faced by people? To address the immigration problem also means this: to dare to look at these non-Community citizens threatened with expulsion or being expelled who, having entered the closely-guarded Schengen area, find themselves battling against recalcitrant administrations. If the European Union wishes to be and remain an area of freedom, justice and security, it will have to adopt legal instruments that are not only effective but also take the human factor into account. Not measures which, like this initiative, are basically aimed only at establishing a security policy under which foreigners, perceived as a threat, can no longer enjoy their rights and freedoms and the word justice has become meaningless. Moreover, it is difficult to accept the legal basis chosen for this proposal, namely Article 63(3) of the EC Treaty. That article is concerned only with immigration measures taken in specific circumstances, and in particular the conditions under which a third-country national can be sent back or expelled, against his will, to his country of origin. The present proposal for a directive does not address these matters. It is confined simply to the mutual recognition of decisions already taken. The proposal does not, therefore, set out to lay down Community rules on expulsion. It would therefore be dangerous to adopt an initiative of this kind to tackle an issue as sensitive as immigration. Any rules adopted in this regard must respect the humanitarian and universalist values that underpin Europe. Otherwise, our Community policies would become meaningless.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today the issue of immigration crosses all areas in our European societies, from the situation of legal immigrants to that of illegal immigrants, from the right of asylum to the right of freedom of movement, from socio-economic and cultural rights to political rights. In the majority of EU States, figures on the granting of refugee status and traditional immigration channels are falling systematically. On the other hand, the figures for overall immigration have remained stable in recent years, proving that restrictive policies on immigration and visas have succeeded only in increasing the number of illegal immigrants. On a daily basis, men, women and children die in the attempt to enter illegally into a Europe which has become a real Fortress. For the most part they fall victim to smugglers and traffickers. Unfortunately, their ordeal continues once they have entered European States as, without regular papers, they can be freely exploited and forced to suffer intolerable living conditions. We should point out that some legal immigrants have been made illegal by restrictive legislation. Some of these have been living in Europe for over twenty years. They can no longer be expelled, nor can their situation be regularised. What means is available to them to earn a living and support their families? The solutions laid down in the proposed initiatives replicate these repressive measures and grounds for exclusion. They give rise to tragedies such as those in Dover, Gibraltar or the situation of those immigrants without regular papers in Spain, Belgium and France who are on hunger strike in order to obtain recognition. Who is really responsible? Not only do these proposals not meet these requirements, but they even go so far as to challenge the right of asylum or the right of family reunion. While it is clear that we must staunchly fight the organised networks trafficking in human beings, it is unjust to condemn natural or legal persons who, in good faith, assist asylum seekers fleeing conflict, famine and the horrors caused by economic and democratic deficits. These initiatives, therefore, lump all categories together in an inadmissible and dangerous fashion. While the proposed amendments limit some of the damage, we reject the initiatives and would vehemently urge the authors to go back to the drawing board. It is only possible to combat illegal immigration within the framework of an overall Community policy that is clear and that respects the dignity of human beings based on genuine respect for fundamental rights and based on a new North-South relationship. Finally we would point out that the best weapon to combat discrimination and human exploitation is to acknowledge rights and thus to regularise their status.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Algeria, the month of Ramadan has been marked by a new escalation in the terror: after all the dreadful massacres which have taken place since 1991, at the start of the civil war, not to mention the thousands of people traumatised or missing, and the anguish and terror of their families. Despite the civil concord law initiated by president Bouteflika, there has been no halt to the violence. The Algerian people still aspire to peace and reconciliation, yet these appear to be irreconcilable with lack of punishment. As the international human rights organisations have shown, the fight against Islamist terrorism is being waged illegally. It is crucial for the Algerian authorities to agree to bring all those responsible for all these crimes before the courts. In this context, one question arises. What is the meaning of the apparent impotence and passivity of the armed forces? In Algeria, no one can deny the intransigence of the senior military hierarchy which has been in power for 39 years, blocking the political system and cultivating a lack of transparency. For too long Europe has elected not to intervene in events in Algeria, siding with the established administration. We need urgently to adjust our simplistic Manichaean view which sees Islamism as solely responsible for the current deterioration. Algerian society is deeply stricken by widespread corruption and social and economic exclusion. Europe’s failure to adopt a strong position entails the risk that the social forces for change, which offer hope for the future and which are attempting to free themselves of the pressures relating to power, will be endangered and smothered. By remaining attentive to the threats affecting the people, and by making it possible to recognise a right of asylum, solid bridges may be built between the two sides of the Mediterranean. In order to help Algeria to gain democratic freedoms, relations should cease to be purely a matter of state, but should be in the interests of the peoples. Let us never forget that any infringements of rights primarily affect the working classes and provide an ideal breeding ground for all sorts of extremism.

 Ladies and gentlemen, the French initiative that we are discussing today once again demonstrates the importance of clarifying all the measures on free movement which present the problem of opening up borders. All the statistics show that migratory flows have not diminished and that they will even increase over the coming years. Therefore, the problem of free movement of third-country nationals within the Schengen area will again rear its head and become even more acute. Yet, the citizens of Europe expect a clear and consistent overall policy on migration. The amendment of Article 18 of the Schengen Agreement is the key element of the French initiative. A holder of a long-stay visa should not enjoy fewer rights than a person who holds a short-stay visa. The issue is to facilitate the free movement of migrants who return home regularly, whatever visa they hold. We should be aware that, currently, third-country nationals may only transit through the territory of another Member State in order to reach the country which issued their long-stay visa. From then on, they can no longer move around within the Schengen area until they have obtained a residence permit. This is where the difficulty lies. In terms of the principle of free movement, third-country nationals with a long-stay visa are in the most unfavourable position, even though they might have had to wait several months or even years to obtain the visa. Furthermore, the text of the French initiative omits the problem of family reunion, a problem which arises in particular when citizens of the Union marry third-country nationals. Why not therefore treat those who hold a long-stay visa as already resident so that they can enjoy the same right to freedom of movement? As Mr Deprez also highlighted, the legal basis of the proposal could have been envisaged in a different way so that it covered all aspects mentioned in these arrangements. To sum up, it seems right to reject an imprecise and incomplete initiative relating to a matter as sensitive as Community immigration policy. In order to respect and fully guarantee Community legislative power, we must urgently adopt legislation on rights to freedom of movement, immigration and asylum. The only way to prevent a Fortress Europe being built is to make our repressive visa policy considerably more flexible. The current system does nothing to reduce the migratory flow, on the contrary, it encourages networks of smugglers of illegal immigrants to thrive.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is a key stage in the construction of Europe, has given rise to much discussion. Some think it a success and others now think it a thwarted ambition. Many people thought that Europe at long last had the opportunity to emerge from the single free-trade area and the liberal rut in order to establish the foundation of a People’s Europe. Everything conspired to strengthen this hope: the formation of the Convention which established a new precedent in relation to the usual intergovernmental method, the public debates and the full set of texts available on an Internet site that was accessible to everyone, as well as the fact that the opinion of civil society was consulted. Transparency was no substitute, however, for the democratic deficit, as the NGOs were only given five minutes to speak and their points were only rarely taken into consideration. So, yes, some progress was made, but not enough to compensate for the omissions. It took many weeks of battling to incorporate the right to strike into the Charter. The right to employment was transformed into the right to work. The right to health, social security, accommodation or a minimum income either do not feature, or are expressed only as a token of social cohesion. Freedom of the press is no longer ‘guaranteed’, only ‘respected’. Minority rights are the minimum possible. Discrimination between European and third country residents is ratified, as is the freedom of movement laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, or the right to live as a family, even though this is recognised in international law. A great many rights, including political rights, become subject to a European preference in place of national preference. So what has become of our sacrosanct principle that the law shall be universal, indivisible and unique? What has become of European citizenship, the heart of this Europe of equality for all citizens? We are left with a feeling of bitterness. This Charter is the extension of a liberal Europe which is opposed to the social Europe of the citizens. What attitude can we possibly adopt now with regard to this text which is no better than nothing since it falls short of existing rights? The Charter as it stands is in no position to become ‘meaningful’ for the citizens of Europe. All it brings is an added value; it does not remotely meet their expectations or their requirements. As regards fundamental rights, is it possible to accept a minimal common denominator at a time when Europe wishes to set itself up as a role model for human rights? We must refuse to be satisfied with this minimalist Charter to which the Social Democrats of Europe appear to have resigned themselves. The Charter cannot serve as a smokescreen for the French Presidency in order to conceal an IGC that is on its last legs. At the European Summit in Nice, in December, civil society resolved to mobilise in order to make itself heard and to forcefully express its desire for a charter offering the citizens of Europe genuine guarantees. We must support these actions and, rather than accepting a shaky text, we must call upon the Convention to continue working after Nice, involving new procedures and extensive public debate. It is not just our rights and our freedoms but our democracy which is at stake here.

Ladies and gentlemen, judicial and police cooperation is one of the most fundamental issues in the construction of a European area of freedom, security and justice and will enable this area to swiftly become real and effective for the citizens. In dealing with these matters, our rapporteurs have centred their considerations both on the Protocol amending the Europol Convention and on improving mutual assistance. We can but congratulate them on their work. Our primary concern, however, relates to the extension of Europol’s competences. We agree that there is an express and urgent need for effective judicial cooperation, but, at the same time, denounce a shift that contains the seeds of a Europol set up outside the control of Parliament or of any legal authority, and, in more general terms, a democratic deficit in a Europe that the Member States insist in confining to the misty realms of intergovernmental procedures, thus skirting the obligations, duties and control that derive from universal suffrage. I can see grey areas regarding Europol: the diplomatic immunity of its members, no definition of authorised resources nor of the limits on these, notifications of the filing of personal records, filing of records in areas protected by international texts and declarations of human rights, threats to freedoms given the risk of their being abused, now or in the future, following the kind of political changes liable to be seen in certain Member States. Were the European police force to be offered this heaven-sent chance of potential self-regulation, it would do its utmost to curb the European Parliament’s vague desire for democratic control, given the current deficiencies at organisational level and the lack of unity on the background issues. The Portuguese initiative concerning the Europol Convention is intended to spur the European Parliament into choosing the right route to ensuring security, with this hingeing around a discretionary filing of records on citizens in all the areas affecting their private lives. Of course, we must identify, prosecute and sentence people who launder dirty money on behalf of terrorists, arms dealers and drug traffickers. But this will not provide us with firmer guarantees on the right of defence and the protection of citizens’ rights. It is for this reason that we are tabling amendments on the strengthening of these rights and freedoms, on the need to adopt an instrument, on the right of defence, and on the recognition of the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice. It has not escaped our notice that one of the articles in the Council Act, which has curiously not been commented on, stipulates that Europol is to specify whether data relating to ethnic origin, religious or other types of beliefs, political leanings, sexual tendencies or health can be included in the data records. Are we going to equivocate any longer over Europol’s competences when the very notion of democratic control has been struck off the statute book? The democratic values that everyone in this Chamber shares must be the very ones that govern our deeds and works, in order to forge a European Union based on solidarity and social commitment and not on policing and repression.

Ladies and gentlemen, although the need for a future European public prosecution service would not seem to pose a problem in the long run, that of harmonising our policies on the protection of citizens’ rights and establishing a criminal procedure par excellence 
would seem to be more than essential. Indeed, how can one possibly set up a European public prosecution service when there is not even a European civil code or, what is more, a European criminal code? Even if this circumstance presents no direct obstacle to the initiative on the creation of Eurojust, there is in fact one institution over which the European Parliament exercises no control and over which judicial control by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, pursuant to Article 35 of the Treaty, is not applied. How could one possibly consider setting up Eurojust when Europol is already operating as a free agent? Two things must be borne in mind: we cannot contemplate any tangible improvement in judicial cooperation between the Member States without this clearly being conditional on the protection of the rights of the defence in legal proceedings involving more than one State. This is the aim of our amendments. It follows that citizens’ rights must be reinforced by adopting an effective instrument and recognising the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice, not least with regard to its right of interpretation and its power to decide on a case or not. Moreover, the flaws in the new efforts to combat organised crime can be attributed to the division of competences between Europol and Eurojust, and these have not been clearly addressed in any case or at any point. Well, as you know, the issue of competence and the limits on this competence are central to this Community harmonisation aimed at improving the justice system. The clear allocation of fields of intervention to either judicial cooperation or police cooperation is not only needed to prevent any conflict of responsibilities, but is also fundamental in terms of guaranteeing observance of the democratic rules that form the bedrock of the rule of law. The Member States of the European Community subscribe to these on the basis of their existing legislative, executive and legal systems, in accordance with the principle of fundamental rights and common values. Eurojust must therefore slot into the relationship between judicial cooperation and police cooperation. The European Parliament is the supranational Community body that can determine this relationship, and I therefore propose that you support its validity by showing support for our rapporteur.

 Ladies and gentlemen, fifty years after the start of the construction of Europe, it is high time for the European Union to at last endow itself with a supervisory authority designed to protect the people of Europe from the potential abuses related to the multiplication of computer-based files containing personal data. The exponential growth of the European Union’s tasks and jurisdiction, and the proliferation of Community bodies, mean that we must have a precise legal definition of the citizens’ rights, and these should cover the transfer of information between European Union institutions and bodies. Under the codecision procedure, the Council submitted a proposal for a regulation to the European Parliament on the basis of Article 286 of the EC Treaty. This article specifies that data protection should be effective within the European Union by 1 January 1999. Nigh on two years later, we have not yet brought matter to a conclusion. This means we should not get embroiled in a lengthy codecision procedure which would delay the implementation of this instrument even longer. This is what Mrs Paciotti has done, and I really think our rapporteur has done a truly remarkable job. Let us get to the heart of the matter. The main bone of contention between the European Parliament and the Council is to do with the jurisdiction of this future supervisory authority. Should it confine itself to the first pillar, i.e. the purely Community bodies, institutions and legal standards, or should it cover all Union-related provisions, i.e. the second and third pillars, such as Schengen or Europol? We think it obvious that the risks related to the private lives of citizens and the misuse of citizens’ personal data are far greater in the context of the third pillar, which at present is subject to little or no judicial and parliamentary control, than in the context of the first pillar, which falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice. In my opinion, it is clear that we would be closing our eyes to the problem if we set up an authority of this type to cover just the Community area, while the main problems arise and will, in future, arise due to third pillar bodies too. Are you aware, for instance, that the Schengen system has amassed over ten million files on almost one and a half million citizens, and that Europol, whose sphere of competence is being incessantly expanded, has a central database of information from the various police forces of the fifteen Member States, all this supervised only by an authority with neither the powers nor the resources available to it to enable it to carry out another task properly. The report which we are to adopt does not reflect this ambition. The scope of the regulation adopted on the basis of the report is limited to the first pillar, i.e. to Article 286. The second and third pillars will not be covered by this regulation and will therefore remain impenetrable, to the detriment of citizens’ basic fundamental rights. In addition to the restrictive reading of Article 286, however, it would have been possible to take Article 255 of the Treaty as a further legal basis in order to expand the scope of this regulation. Indeed Mrs Paciotti attempted to do so by including a reference to this article in Article 12 of the regulation, but the Council refused to entertain this possibility. There are many other problem areas which require some pragmatic evaluation if they are to be practicable. In the end, though, our rapporteur is well aware of these problems and is anxious not to add another two years to the existing backlog. We shall therefore offer her our support, in spite of everything, in the hope that the Council and, in particular, the Commission will be careful not to take advantage of the weaknesses of the text in order to attempt to make nonsense of it. They must, furthermore, seek to implement means for the protection of personal data in the second and third pillars too at the earliest possible opportunity. It is dangerous, in any case, to allow bodies such as Europol or the Schengen system to develop without parliamentary or judicial control.

 Ladies and gentlemen, we are now facing a fairly unusual procedure which deserves a detailed explanation so that everyone can vote in the full knowledge of what is explicitly and implicitly at stake in this matter. Last November, the majority of the European Parliament adopted a report on the creation of the Eurodac system. Following this vote, the Council modified its proposal for a regulation, stating that the Eurodac system for comparing fingerprints should be established and administered by the Council rather than the Commission. This important change is the reason why this report is being re-examined by this Chamber. In the opinion of our Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, it was the Commission rather than the Council that should be given responsibility for administering this new facility, Eurodac. Indeed, the Commission quite rightly emphasised that, as the only Community institution of the Union, it ought to have responsibility for administering a Community programme like Eurodac, and not in any circumstances the Council, which is an intergovernmental body. We wholly support the Commission on this. However, the new proposal being examined today has not taken any account whatsoever of the amendments Parliament has voted in favour of. Whether it be about specifying 18 years as the minimum age at which an applicant for asylum can be registered on the Eurodac database, about erasing personal data once legally recognised status has been acquired or about substituting the expression ‘third-country national’ for ‘alien’, the Council has not seen fit to take account of Parliament’s opinion and has been supported in this by the Commission, which has also declined to take account of it. It is in view of this situation that I am today asking you again to uphold the vote which Parliament wisely held last year. This means voting on the text adopted by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which includes the amendments relating to the lower age limit of 18 years, the erasing of personal data in the case of any applicant who has achieved legal status and the use of the expression ‘third-country national’ rather than ‘alien’. The amendments to the report proposed by the Group of the European People’s Party, to which the rapporteur belongs, should therefore be rejected. I really find it difficult to understand how anyone can remain silent and avoid taking sides and consider taking fingerprints from 14-year-old adolescents to be a legitimate action, when it is something which contravenes all the international treaties in force, particularly those on the rights of the child. When it comes to erasing personal data, it is just a question of being sensible. Once the applicant concerned has obtained legal status, there is in fact no justification for retaining the personal data and fingerprints of someone whose situation has been regularised in law. That would be to view him as a potential criminal. It is not solely in the future Charter that the protection of fundamental rights, close to our hearts as it is, becomes an issue, but also in every European text, where we must be vigilant in their defence. What is at stake is Parliament’s credibility in the eyes of those who already have a lot of difficulty putting their trust in us. The people of Europe find it incomprehensible, and surprising to say the least, that the European Parliament should one day come out in favour of a report only, a few months later, to go back on its decision and vote in favour of a radically different report. How can our electorate have confidence in a Parliament which changes its views according to the way the wind blows and which is incapable of facing up to the Commission and the Council which do not, for all that, have the democratic legitimacy with which we have as an institution. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I would today ask you to vote in such a way as to reaffirm last November’s vote and to adopt the report in the form presented to you by the committee. It is in adopting coherent and consistent positions that Parliament will enhance its stature.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank all of you who have, through your comments, contributed to fuelling this debate. Before embarking on an explanation of my report, I would like to start by asking you a question that I cannot get out of my head. This is in my view the crux of the problem described in my report and will determine the way we vote. This question is: what in fact does European citizenship really mean? Is it just a simple expression aimed at selling Europe, or do we really want to add content to this term? Today, for the majority of us who live in Europe, European citizenship is still a concept that is devoid of meaning. If we want Europe to be more than a vast free trade area, we must take action to ensure that European citizenship goes beyond the status of a concept and takes root in the everyday life of the citizens of Europe. This is the context in which I wish to place this debate. The directives that have been examined concern Community nationals, but they must be modified in favour of third-county nationals. The report aims to sum up the reality of the freedom to move and reside in the European Union. With reference to the EC Treaty, my report was written with due regard to Article 14, concerning free movement of persons, and Articles 17 and 18 concerning European citizenship, which entails the right to move and to reside freely throughout the territory of the European Union. Although Member States have made great progress in ensuring the free movement of goods, services and capital, it is clear that we are no nearer to achieving the same for people. I will start by filling in some of the background and the content of the directives. Initially, freedom of movement was reserved for people who were economically active. In June 1990, the Council adopted three Commission draft directives to extend this right to all Member State nationals, even if they were not economically active. I will just give the broad guidelines of these directives. For retired people and other non-economically active people, the right of residence is open to those who have health insurance cover and adequate means. For students, the right of residence is subject to the condition that the student is enrolled at a recognised educational establishment and that he is covered by sickness insurance. In both cases, spouses and dependent children may accompany the holder of the right of residence and may work. The transposition of these directives was doubly problematic. On the one hand, the directives were transposed extremely slowly throughout the Union. What is more, the Commission had to initiate fourteen infringement procedures. The Commission concludes that ‘for too long, EU citizens have been denied some of their rights or been faced with unjustified administrative difficulties due to the incorrect transposition of the Directives’. Let us now proceed to a concrete assessment of the situation. This right to free movement and residence, which is confirmed in the Maastricht Treaty, is violated by economic considerations. The notion of adequate means is incorrectly interpreted by governments. What income is to be taken into account when evaluating means? What evidence must be provided? How does one take into consideration a progressive financial situation which sometimes depends on the help provided by the spouse? Because the acceptance procedures are long and difficult, it is often necessary to take out a second health insurance in the host country. When you are not in salaried work, it is difficult to obtain a residence permit and the instability of the professional situation is added to by the short-term nature of the residence permit once it has been obtained. With regard to special measures justified in the name of public order, the Commission gives examples of many cases of incorrect interpretations, such as criminal convictions that justify systematic deportation and expulsion. Finally, administrative procedures are too long – more than six months – and become very costly when frequent renewal is necessary, as the period of validity is normally two years rather than five. I will now present the main measures advocated with a view to overcoming these problems. Our first proposal is to ask the Commission to prepare a framework directive, which would adopt a position based on the fundamental right of free movement and residence rather than on a sector-specific approach which necessarily leaves room for ambiguities. It will still be possible at a later date to implement a whole raft of specific measures to help citizens depending on their particular situation. This reworking of the existing directives must dissociate the fundamental right of movement and residence from any economic considerations. These measures must be concomitant with simplifying administrative procedures and providing documents free of charge. Until these mechanisms can be put in place, a transitional measure may be to introduce a one-year residence permit for all applicants. Harmonising social protection systems and pension systems is vital. Finally, in the case of special measures justified by the notion of public order, we can only call on Member States to narrow down their interpretation, to put an end to the double penalty and to protect certain categories of people from expulsion. I would like to finish by clarifying a number of points. Rights must be attached to the individual and the individual must take the rights with him wherever he goes. Third-country citizens living and working legally in a Member State must benefit from the same rights as European citizens. Furthermore, it is a pity that the Council has not followed up this proposal of citizenship and residence. In conclusion, I hope that I have persuaded you to support this resolutely citizen-centred approach of freedom of movement and residence, which is a fundamental issue for awareness of a European identity. At a time when discussions about the future of Europe are hitting the headlines, and when we are examining a future charter of fundamental rights, we must support any project aimed at providing an area of freedom, justice and equality, where all the residents and citizens who contribute to the construction of Europe must have the same rights. Perhaps it is time that people acquired the same rights as the products they consume.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Paciotti has produced an excellent, very logical report, precise in its observations and balanced in its conclusions. She has taken account both of the requisite protection for individuals against any misuse of their own personal data and of the need to reach an agreement with the United States as quickly as possible so as not to put a brake upon the development of trade. At a time when it seems certain that an information society will be developed on the back of the new technologies, we think it vital immediately to implement the means needed to protect the consumer and the citizen from the abuses inherent in the marketing and innovative techniques that are so greedy for accurate information. In the context of an agreement with the United States, the rapporteur emphasised the extent to which this country lacked any legally binding standard on personal data protection. So American firms may use all the data they wish without the Federal State finding fault with this. We feel that it is particularly dangerous that the Commission should be willing to ratify an agreement that offers so few guarantees for the citizen. The ‘safe harbour’ system proposed by the American authorities offers no protection at all. It is a voluntary standard which American firms would themselves apply internally and then only with regard to Europeans. This text, moreover, does not give citizens the right to go to court if their rights are flouted. It would be a great shame, particularly now that, after years of discussion, the Council appears to be willing to set up a proper European body to monitor the use of personal data, if we were to ease off the pressure in terms of our demands on the subject with regard to third countries in general and the United States in particular. It is a condition sine qua non
 for any real protection of citizens’ individual liberties. In conclusion, I should like to remind the Commission that personal data protection is an integral part... (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when expressions like ‘bringing the European Union closer to its citizens’ and ‘good governance’ are on everyone’s lips, an examination of the way the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction works, and of its scientific output, proves quite astonishing, as its conclusions are virtually non-existent. Like the increasing number of centres that are being set up in order to conceal our differences, this one, in its five years of existence, has done nothing to justify the millions of euros that are pumped into it each year. If you compare the amount of money which it is allocated with that available to national bodies, one would expect to see in-depth studies leading, as stipulated in the definition of its aims in Article 2, to the provision of objective, reliable and comparable information concerning drugs and drug addiction. This Centre ought to be in a position to establish definitions and uniform indicators with a view to carrying out an evaluation of the various anti-drugs policies implemented in the Member States, from both a health and socio-economic as well as a law-and-order perspective. When will we get to know, for example, what the consequences have been of the prohibitionist policy adopted in France or of the regulatory one adopted in the Netherlands? The independent assessment of the activities of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the conclusions of which were published in March 2000, is very specific regarding the serious mismanagement of the board of directors and of the REITOX network, which gathers information on drugs and drug addiction. The reports that we are looking at today are about expanding the Centre to Norway and to the 13 candidate countries. On this issue we must agree, but would it not be better to reform this body beforehand, so that it might finally serve a useful purpose? New members should certainly be welcomed, but with what in mind? Is the idea to reproduce the failure we have witnessed over the past few years, but on an even larger scale? To add to the length of the beautifully presented annual reports which achieve precisely nothing? It is high time that the European Union became aware that, a long way from the Centre’s magnificent premises in Lisbon, thousands of people are directly faced with the health and social difficulties engendered by drug dependence. We are not asking it to deal with such problems, we are simply asking that it should analyse them. Hundreds of varying initiatives are being implemented in Europe by both institutions and associations, which focus either on criminalisation or risk reduction. What is the Centre waiting for to evaluate these strategies? How is it that Member States are being so reluctant to cooperate in evaluation? Is it possible that there is a fear that the results may not be that great politically? I therefore join the rapporteur in arguing in favour of the idea of a real reform of the Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, in respect both of the way it functions and of expanding its activities. This, moreover, is a necessary precondition to taking on new members.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will allow me to speak on behalf of the Greens as my colleague has had to accompany the Member who was taken ill. In my opinion, it is very fortunate that Mrs Sörensen should have been given the responsibility of preparing this report on trafficking in women. There are few rapporteurs who have such direct knowledge of this subject for Mrs Sörensen has been concerned for over 20 years with the issues of trafficking in women and prostitution. We should therefore place our full trust in her proposals. I myself totally support her report. However, I should like to comment briefly on the discussions held on this subject in committee and also in the Member States, given that the United Nations Conference on the situation of women throughout the world, to be held in New York in June, is now approaching. In these discussions several rather abolitionist associations have tried to lump together trafficking in women, prostitution and pimping. They have therefore encouraged a certain amount of generalisation and are, as a result, opposed to any form of debate on these issues, hiding behind moral considerations such as the inalienability of the human body and its treatment as a saleable commodity. To this end, they have attacked the latest report by the International Labour Office on trafficking in women and prostitution, and the work of Mrs Lin Lean Lim highlighting the need for a statute to protect prostitutes. They have also decried Europe as a pimp on the grounds that certain countries are trying to establish non-abolitionist legislation in this area. We surely cannot leave an issue such as this in the hands of associations of which some, and only some, having fought against abortion, are now refusing the distribution of condoms to prostitutes, which they see as encouraging prostitution. There is but a single step from commiseration to stigmatisation and from victimisation to contempt and exclusion from public debate. The only solution for prostitutes is to be integrated within a common law system, to look after themselves, to live decently, to defend themselves against the violence to which they are subjected by pimps, clients and institutions. The only solution is to recognise prostitutes as such and, as a first step, to give them a voice. Recognition of their professional activity, full social rights and police protection from any form of violence are what they are demanding. We must listen to them. Whether legislation is abolitionist as in France, prohibitionist as in Sweden or even sometimes regulatory, if it fails to recognise a whole population this can only reinforce discrimination against forced immigrants and also prostitutes, irrespective of whether they are immigrants or not. The ineffectiveness of the law reinforces the enslavement of male and female prostitutes by pimps, for some, and the impossibility for others of living with dignity or of getting out of prostitution. This leads to a breakdown in any fragile solidarity and further damage to their self-image. Mrs Roure is right in her analysis of this problem but we accept that different solutions must be examined and that various proposals must be made and considered. The Commission absolutely must examine all forms of common legislation on prostitution which would give real status to prostitutes in order to protect these women and men from pimping, violence and marginalisation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, three years after the Treaty of Amsterdam was adopted and the famous and much-debated Article 13 was introduced, the Council is proposing two directives to implement the principles of this Treaty. We can only congratulate the Council’s willingness to make progress on this issue, particularly at a time when certain parties of the traditional right are starting to sign agreements with extreme-right movements. This has already happened in France, is now occurring in Austria and may soon happen in Italy. The definition of a minimum European framework for the fight against discrimination is therefore urgently required. The directive on the fight against racial and ethnic discrimination is heading in the right direction. In particular, it provides for the reversal of the burden of proof, the gradual establishment of positive discrimination – more effective than simple theoretical equality – and the recognition of indirect discrimination. All these aspects reveal a clear desire to forge ahead. However, certain shortcomings must be highlighted. Some of these have been raised by our rapporteur, such as the issue of legal proceedings being free of charge for plaintiffs and the necessary extension of the right to take part in court proceedings to groups and associations. There are also two other problems which I must raise. The first is of a general nature. How can the Council consider the issue of racial and ethnic discrimination without being committed to the creation of a comprehensive legislative framework for all discrimination? Singling out one type of discrimination gives the impression that some types of discrimination are less reprehensible than others. This is unacceptable. A second directive on discrimination at work is to be examined shortly. The Council must therefore make haste and propose a draft directive encompassing all types of discrimination. This is absolutely vital as the most excluded are those who suffer several types of discrimination. Protecting them from just one type will only go part-way towards helping them. The second problem concerns the exclusion of religious discrimination from this directive. It is extremely regrettable that religious discrimination was not included with racial and ethnic discrimination as these different types of discrimination are closely linked. For example, how do you define the Jewish identity? Surely the hatred for Jews which remains significant in many countries is due as much to anti-Semitism, and therefore to ethnic origin, as to religious aspects. Discrimination against North African communities in Europe is also two-sided. It may even often be said that the fear of Islam acts as a catalyst for racism towards these communities. Therefore, limiting this directive to racial and ethnic discrimination risks leaving the door open to ambiguities in interpretation with which the courts might struggle to deal. To conclude, it is essential that the Council adopts an integrated approach towards the legal tools to be established in order to apply Article 13 in our daily life. Dividing the fight against discrimination among a number of texts is dangerous for the overall coherence of the anti-discrimination mechanism and therefore weakens it.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great relief that we welcomed the proposed Council decision on the creation of a European Refugee Fund. After Kosovo, Chechnya, Afghanistan, to cite but a few of the tragedies which bathe our planet in blood, creating such a body is an increasingly urgent matter. The report shows the extent to which parliamentary activity can be beneficial to Europe. We therefore support these motions. We shall here mention only three points. Firstly, if there is one point on which the report is not satisfactory, it is financial resources. Very few resources are allocated to the Fund, considering the scale of its activities – improving reception conditions, integrating persons benefiting from international protection, encouraging voluntary return by facilitating reintegration in the country of origin. These are huge tasks requiring amounts far greater than those initially planned. We must provide ourselves with the resources to realise our shared ambitions, and make Europe a land of solidarity and hospitality, which respects human dignity and the values which are the reasons for thousands of people to seek asylum, particularly freedom of democratic expression and peace. Secondly, improving reception conditions should also include providing access to health care for all, the provision of education for children, and also training. Already made rootless by virtue of their exile, families must be able to benefit from education for their children and training programmes for young people in order to regain some stability, to promote their social and economic integration, and to encourage their possible return to their own country. Thirdly, many of us are calling for NGOs and the associations working on a day-to-day basis with refugees to be consulted, both in defining the necessary programmes and in their implementation. It would be a serious mistake to exclude the very women and men who often, with their invaluable experience, make good the omissions of the State, from the process. Finally, in conclusion, I should like once again to stress the ever more insistent need for Member States to arrive quickly at common legislation in matters of asylum. It is only this advance which will make it possible to allow this European Fund to make a proper impact.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report highlights the many errors and omissions which the action plans contain. First of all, there is the question of partnership, particularly the place given to NGOs. Their opinion has not been sought or has not been taken into consideration. Another error is that questions relating to asylum and those relating to emigration have been dealt with in the same way. It is true that one cannot attack the causes of migratory flows without talking about human rights. I am going to talk about asylum. With some countries Europe is signing agreements which include readmission clauses authorising the deportation of third country nationals without the political, economic and social situation of the individual or the country being taken into account. This clause is a violation of international law. It refutes the principle of not expelling people before considering whether they are being sent back to a safe country. Just how is it possible to believe that people sent back to certain countries will be safely welcomed there when human rights, particularly those of women, are violated on a daily basis in those countries? Just how can we agree to making development aid conditional upon the signature of such agreements? Europe must cease to turn a blind eye. The best solution to reduce the flow of migration is to support development in these countries and support the welfare of these peoples. This means cancelling the debt of developing countries. Cancelling the debt would make it possible to develop educational, social and medical structures, which would directly benefit the population. Moreover, it would be better to improve the host structures for refugees and asylum seekers, who are currently treated as if they were criminals wishing to take advantage of the system. They must be adequately looked after, and, in particular, given access to medical care, social entitlements, and education for children. In conclusion, would it not be more urgent to harmonise our asylum and migration policies and to establish a genuine Community policy on the subject?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of our discussion of these reports on human rights inside and outside the European Union, the time is therefore right to consider the cross-influences between the ‘inside’ and the ‘outside’. Clearly, the Union’s best tool for disseminating its human rights model is the experience of migrants. Yet our greatest failings in human rights involve these very people. I can give you two examples of this. Firstly, there is cause for concern about the shape being taken by the readmission agreements which directly threaten fundamental rights such as the right of asylum or the right to live as a family. The Union has confirmed its attachment to the Geneva and Dublin Conventions by establishing the anti-deportation principle. It is therefore unacceptable that the readmission agreements can allow a third country national to be returned to his or her country when we know that this country more often than not does not guarantee respect for human rights and democratic freedoms. It is just as unacceptable to see families torn apart with children sometimes being left alone following the expulsion of their parents who have no right of residence, even though some have lived and worked in Europe for nearly ten years. What image of human rights do you think they will take back to their countries given their experiences of questionable living conditions, humiliating body searches, insults, endless forms and interrogations in police stations and detention centres? After all this, we then just end up sending them back to countries which they are legitimately seeking to leave, often for political and economic as well as humanitarian reasons. These readmission agreements are dangerous for asylum-seekers, for the dissemination of human rights throughout the world and for the international stature of the European Union. If the Union wants to be taken seriously on the issue of respect for human rights, it must immediately stop these expulsions. It must legalise the situation of all these men and women who are deprived of all rights, including the right to live as a family and the right of free movement, and who are currently kept in a situation of official illegality. Another flagrant attack on human rights concerns foreigners and citizenship. How can we expect third country nationals to integrate and their children to respect the law and to believe in the reality of democratic rights when they are not allowed to exercise these rights? At a time when the Union is considering the definition of a Charter of Fundamental Rights, why are we creating second-class citizens? This really is a case of fundamental rights. How can we allow some people to be excluded? How can they believe in the reality of the Declaration of Human Rights? On human rights, the Union could take pride in being the first in history to define citizenship according to a principle of residence instead of establishing discrimination based on nationality.

 Ladies and gentlemen, as we have been told by the Council representatives, the amendments adopted by Parliament and included in the text have improved the draft regulation. However, this is still unacceptable to us as it stigmatises third country nationals and tends to criminalise them. Given that we are now discussing a Charter of Fundamental Rights and yesterday, for instance, a report on human rights, could we really live within a fortress Europe outside, or even inside, which rights might be being violated? Moreover, this draft regulation concerns us basically because we feel that it is not needed yet. It is, we feel, putting the cart before the horse. We are using and establishing instruments before we have developed a proper harmonised policy on the right to freedom of movement, the right to live as a family and the right of asylum. We should start by harmonising this policy. We can look at the instruments for implementation and control after that. Finally, a third point which particularly concerns us is the dismissal of Parliament’s opinion. This raises a vital question about the democratic credit granted to the Members of the European Parliament. It is a shame that we are currently being given the impression that we serve no useful purpose. We are told that this is just a case of abstention but this is actually the norm as Members’ opinions are not being taken into account. To conclude, the establishment of this area of freedom, security and justice needs instruments. Yet this security can be achieved only if there is real justice, and freedom can be achieved only if we have rights which are respected.

 Ladies and gentlemen, the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be an essential stage in the construction of Europe. We must provide ourselves with the means to make it the founding element of European identity, allowing Europe to make the qualitative leap it needs in order to feel that it really does exist. In this context, I should like to join my fellow Members in pointing out the need to ensure that this charter is of a binding nature, for the citizens would find it hard to understand the European Union working on defining fundamental rights if it was not then possible to guarantee them in law. Fundamental rights, and let me stress this word, fundamental rights can be no less than mandatory. If they are not, then the whole construction of Europe would lose its fundamental nature in the opinion of many people. The future charter must be included among the Treaties and this must be achieved on the occasion of the next IGC, probably the last with the current fifteen countries. France, the self-proclaimed home of human rights, must absolutely take advantage of its presidency during the second half of 2000 in order to table this amendment of the Treaties. This is a formal request which we are making to the French Government. There are, however, two points that I would like to mention here. Firstly, I should like to stress the need for the charter to develop the concept of European citizenship due to residence. More than ever, it is essential to avoid the coexistence in Europe of distinct classes of people enjoying distinct rights. For example, how acceptable is it that an Algerian who has worked and paid taxes in France for thirty years may not vote in local elections whilst a European resident for six months in another European country can take part? This charter must make every effort to develop our definition of European citizenship based on the idea of residence. The rights that we are defining, if they are to be fundamental, must be applicable to everyone. Secondly, I should like to stress the urgent need to include effective protection for personal data held on computer within the scope of the charter. Last month, the European Parliament in fact adopted an amendment asking for a Committee on Information Technology and European Liberties to be set up. Well, this cannot truly exist unless it is based on a solid legal standard. The charter must therefore ensure that it defines the limits of the content of files, the means permitted for data retrieval, and access methods. Moreover, at a time when certain communication systems, certain spying systems, are prohibited, we must guarantee citizens’ rights with regard to the new European bodies which are being developed, and guarantee the rights of the citizen by means of parliamentary monitoring, but also consumer rights with regard to the new Internet marketing techniques. This is a major issue for the guaranteeing of fundamental freedoms in the twenty-first century.

Mr President, for about ten years there has been a wave of violence across Egypt. Despite this, all we have observed, both from the international community and from our own European institution, is a long silence. It is true that Egypt plays a fundamental part in the peace process in the Middle East and its geopolitical situation means that nobody dares to speak up about distressing matters. We can only be delighted that a debate has finally been held on this country, a country that is at the heart of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. Nevertheless, it is regrettable that the debate is being held because of such an unfortunate current situation in that country. Of course, we support the efforts of the Egyptian government to combat the rise of religious fundamentalism, but this battle against the extremists cannot justify infringement of the rights of the Egyptian people, particularly their political rights. It cannot draw a veil over attacks on human rights such as freedom of expression and fundamental rights. In this regard, we condemn the fact that this country has retained the death penalty. Finally, we would ask the Council to make provision in the MEDA programme for specific measures in favour of social and economic development, the development of democracy and the promotion of tolerance between all the ethnic and cultural minorities that make up the richness of Egyptian society.

 Although the main achievements in the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice should be mentioned, we must remember that there is still room for progress. The role of the Court of Justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete. The unilateral decision by Belgium to re-establish border controls is a clear illustration of this. The decision to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be welcomed but it is difficult to predict whether its content and legal scope will be restrictive or symbolic, including all people, whatever their nationality, or excluding some.  The total lack of progress in European citizenship and the political rights of all European residents is to be regretted. Although action plans established by the high-level working group aim to limit migratory flows in the future, these plans do nothing to improve human rights, civil liberties and the economic situation in the countries concerned. We know that readmission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements. Yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of ‘non-refoulement
’ [no turning back]. Furthermore, it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the Council by a procedure without debate and without consulting Parliament. However, the main concern remains … (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, the human rights situation in Djibouti is giving us great cause for concern. The political prisoners are being held in terrible conditions for they are either packed into cramped cells or kept in isolation. Hygiene is totally lacking and they have no access to medical care. A tuberculosis epidemic has broken out on several occasions and two prisoners have already died due to lack of care. The political detainees have held hunger strikes to protest against the conditions of their detention and to demand access to medical care and their release in the absence of a fair trial. We should remember that most of the prisoners are being held in preventative detention without having been brought before the courts. Among the prisoners who are ill is Mohamed Kadamiousouf. He is the European representative of the Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy. He was illegally extradited from Ethiopia in 1997 and, in the absence of medical care, risks losing his sight. As respect for human rights constitutes an essential element of the cooperation and development between the European Union and the Republic of Djibouti, we demand, in accordance with these principles, the release of all political prisoners and access to medical care for all detainees. We particularly want emergency medical care to be given to Mohamed Kadamiousouf to prevent him losing his sight. We also demand a guarantee of freedom of expression and political pluralism which are essential for any democracy and the end to repression against opponents of the regime. Finally, we ask the Commission to use all the means in its power to ensure respect for human rights in Djibouti.

) Mr President, it is a real pity that the Intergovernmental Conference will not be considering certain essential elements on the area of freedom, security and justice, none of which can be achieved at the expense of the others. I also regret that our joint motion for a resolution does not mention the problems linked to Eurodac, even though the Council has just announced, contrary to the Treaties, that this body should remain purely intergovernmental. This would, of course, exclude the European Parliament and the Court of Justice from any control in this area. Similarly, faced with the multiplication of information systems such as Europol and Eurodac, this House should have repeated its demand for an independent commission on data processing and the protection of privacy in order to preserve our individual freedoms, in addition to democratic and judicial control. The idea of citizenship is also most notably absent from this text. Yet this is a subject of vital importance. It is a cornerstone of the negotiations on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and also on the constitutionalisation of the Union. When the Union is enlarged, it is this citizenship which must be at the heart of our European project in order to ensure human and sustainable development. To conclude, we must realise that such a pale and insipid text cannot satisfy the people of Europe. We must take care that we do not distance ourselves too much from their aspirations if we are to build a fairer and more democratic Europe with a greater sense of solidarity.

 Madam President, as one might suppose, given the lack of transparency regarding the preparatory work, the conclusions of the Tampere Council are, as far as our Group is concerned, still disappointing in terms of their ambition and vague in terms of their conclusions, even in spite of a few interesting advances. Generally speaking, it is significant that the Council should have announced a specific timetable for the measures to do with the area of security. On the other hand, no clear timetable has been drawn up for the actions to do with an area of freedom. Our fear of the establishment of Fortress Europe therefore still remains. As far as measures regarding the right of asylum and immigration are concerned, they are still totally vague and not at all mandatory. The only good news is the commitment to the observance of the Geneva Convention and further confirmation of the fight against racism. Our Group is pleased to see the desire that was shown to grant similar rights to nationals of third countries as well as to European citizens. It is concerned, however, at the grey areas which remain on this matter. It is indeed vital that this equality in rights should be extended to political rights, to freedom of movement and the right to live together as a family. Europe has a duty to offer the same guarantees to all individuals resident on European soil. Prime Minister Lipponen’s statement regarding the future of the Charter of Fundamental Rights may also be cause for concern. Announcing at this stage that this is to be nothing more than a political declaration is tantamount to wiping out in advance the hard work of the working party. The compulsory aspect of this charter is essential with a view to the construction of a Citizens' Europe. Finally, while the Council announced that the scope of activities and the mandate of Europol, a necessary instrument in the fight against organised crime, were to be increased, what of democratic and judicial supervision, especially regarding the compilation of files? This omission is the potential source of future irregularities as regards our individual and collective freedoms. This omission must be dealt with as a matter of urgency by setting up a Committee on Information Technology and European Freedom.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the holding of a European Council dedicated in part to the area of freedom, security and justice, testimony to the recognition by the European institutions and States of the importance of these essential questions to the future of Europe. These questions are important for all citizens living in this area, since they affect their individual and collective freedoms. Tampere will also provide political orientation on such sensitive questions as immigration policies, which will necessitate a new look at North-South relations, and freedom of movement, which will necessitate real harmonisation of visa policies in Europe, such as the right to asylum and the right to health for all refugees. Other important questions include integration policies, which also affect the cultural rights of minorities, the right to family life with dignity and political rights for all citizens residing in Europe. All these rights must, of course, be included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a Charter which must address all these men and women who live in Europe and thereby enrich it. It is, therefore, necessary to reinforce democratic control of the choices which we are going to make, as today there are still too many shady areas such as Europol. That is why the European Parliament, the product of the will of the people, must be closely associated to meetings such as Tampere. The choices of the European Council must be transparent, in accordance with human rights and the wishes of the European Parliament.

Madam President, Commissioner Busquin, ladies and gentlemen, my fellow fans of communication, since, as was just mentioned, we are by and large among friends in this house, there is actually a whole range of dangers that Mr Herzog has just highlighted and that I will not go over again. I will, therefore, endeavour to be positive by saying that the three reports, despite everything, form part of a policy intended to prevent the digital divide and, from this point of view, I will not just thank the two rapporteurs for their work, but the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will also support these three reports. I will go back over Mrs Read’s proposals in a little more detail because as regards these very technical subjects, which are, however, of financial interest to the European territorial authorities – and I am speaking as someone from the Auvergne, moreover – these proposals help to ensure that the information society is not left in the hands of one or two monopolies. There is not just Bill Gates in the age of computers, and that is just as well. I will, therefore, make every effort to concentrate more specifically on thanking all those who told us beforehand what they were doing, so that we could clearly follow the amendments that were being prepared. The e
TEN programme is a decisive implementation tool alongside the general rules for granting Community financial aid in the area of trans-European networks. This is provided for until 2005. The objective is to raise the aid ceiling to projects in the telecommunication sector from 10% to 30% and this proposal is not insignificant because it will probably enable the Lisbon objectives to be backed up and therefore e
Europe to be developed in the area of services of general interest. This is precisely what we are interested in; that this is known as universal services or services of general interest, and that this service will in any case ultimately apply to all citizens and will be a tool that is strengthened for the good of all. This concept of services of general interest is perhaps even truer, moreover, with the IDABC programme for the period 2005-2009. Indeed, we the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are as you know pro free software and have found that it is backed up because it is included in the idea of interoperable delivery of pan-European e
Government services to administrations. We therefore support these projects. I will say, to conclude – because it is interesting news – that the town of Munich for example, apart from the example that was set with IDA, has switched to LINUX, to free software, and I hope that other administrations will take up the same challenges.

 The Commission’s proposal came at the right time: on the eve of enlargement, people are worried about the possible consequences of a 25-nation Europe for their lives, starting with their employment. While European policies more often than not sing the praises of SMEs and of flexibility at the same time as sometimes adopting measures such as the software patent that make the lives of SMEs impossible, I welcome an initiative that acknowledges the continued status of our industries as major economic and social players. I also welcome the work of the rapporteur who, in choosing to place her document in the context both of the three pillars of sustainable development and of the conclusions of the Lisbon and Gothenburg European Summits, emphasises the importance of an industrial policy that is social and environmental. The Right has attempted to remove these emphases, fortunately without success. The profound changes that are to come in the industrial fabric are so many opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of certain activities. Unfortunately, the document continued to contain a paragraph – which the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance voted against, because it viewed fuel cells and hydrogen as alternative energy sources – which called both for investment in nanotechnologies, with no legal framework and no idea of the health and environmental consequences (one has only to think of the consequences of GMOs) and for investment in the security and defence industry. Apart from this paragraph, the Greens will support this report.

 I supported Mrs Read’s report. It is an excellent piece of work on the Modinis programme. This programme will help to improve the security of information networks throughout the information society within the European Union. It will also promote the dissemination of good practice. I should make it clear that the use of open switchboards is crucial to the security of information. It is important for programmes based on these switchboards to be included in the Modinis programme. The budget for the latter amounts to EUR 25 million.

Madam President, Commissioners, Mr President, honourable Members, Cancún was a failure just like Seattle. Undoubtedly, this round of negotiations was doomed to failure. Who was to blame? The right – the Group of the European People’s Party and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party – are convinced and say that it was the others, the NGOs, the Group of 21. We say it was probably the WTO itself and us as well, who had already negotiated with the United States. Without doubt, we have to admit that the fall is harder for us, the European Union, since you, Commissioners, and you, our leaders, were convinced that we had planned everything for this round to succeed. Everything had been planned, certainly, except the explosion of the Cairns Group, which we had rather sought to neutralise. Everything, except the more coherent emergence, whatever you might say, of the Group of 21, which set itself up as the defender of the developing countries, even if the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP) and the least advanced countries (LACs) are not quite the same thing. We, the North, need to convince the South, for example on the agricultural question, that we really are more equitable. The CAP has been broadly revised, perhaps a little too much, in order to make it more ‘sexy’ in the eyes of the WTO. But the countries of the South, for their part, continue to have a negative perception of all agricultural subsidies, even those which appear to us to be the most virtuous. How can we make countries like the countries of Africa understand our point of view, when their food crops have been ruined for years by the dumping effects of European Union export subsidies (the subsidies which made battery hens from Brittany cheaper to buy than local chickens in Dakar market)? The CAP, by subsidising the export prices of cereals, meat or sugar, has inundated the countries of the South for a long time. How, then, are we to convince them today of the merits of our re-orientations, without abolishing export subsidies? How are we to convince them when, on the crucial question of cotton for Africa, we have appeared to be the unconditional supporters of American derision, via paragraph 27, which postpones any reform in this sector indefinitely? Until we find a way of making the countries of the South understand what the second pillar of agriculture and the social, environmental and food security rules represent, until we allow them to adopt the same rules to protect their rural populations, we shall not rediscover a situation which allows them to understand us. It is this democratic reform that we need to maintain and debate with them. It is by redefining the WTO in rules of this type that we are engaging not only in fair trade but also in democracy.

 Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for reminding us of Cancun’s common theme – the integration of the developing countries. Thank you, too, for matching words with deeds in one or other area where the WTO ought to act differently. If we want to show solidarity with the South and with the most fragile populations of our own area, we cannot treat health, education, water, energy or the necessary progress in sanitation systems as mere commodities. People in all countries must have the benefit of reasonable prices for what are really public services to humanity. The negotiations on GATS need to change course. The right to healthy food in sufficient quantity is also a common good of humanity. Farmers of the North and the South must be able to support a perspective of true multifunctionality. Rural development, the very symbol of the non-market sector, and which will be as crucial an issue tomorrow as it is today, is in fact part of the reorientation of the CAP as just adopted by the Council. It reinforces the adjustments that are a positive signal for our small farmers and for those of the countries of the South. But if you can rely on the start of the decoupling affecting cereals products or meat, then export subsidies must be less obvious and must continue to be less obvious. The distinctive nature of European farmers must be protected. But if solidarity with the small farmers of the South is to be clear, they must be allowed to benefit from support systems similar to the CAP, which still protects European farmers. The prime task of both of them is to feed their fellow citizens by freely producing the appropriate food. They must be helped to do so in the face of the two or three agro-industrial monopolies.

 At a time when José Bové has just been imprisoned in scandalous conditions for having uprooted a few genetically modified plants, we must not lose sight of the political background to this second reading. What we have in this background is the feverish desire of the Commission and the Member States, especially since the complaint lodged by the United States in the WTO on this matter, to lift the 1999 moratorium on GMOs. The most positive aspect of this compromise is that it allows Member States to adopt any measures they wish in order to prevent the contamination of traditional and organic crops by GMOs. These States would simply need to demonstrate the necessary political will to achieve this. Even if these directives, which are to be voted on tomorrow, provide a barrage of arguments against ‘any GMOs’, the problem of genetic contamination, of seeds in particular, still remains to be resolved. Tolerance of the adventitious presence of GMOs varies from 0.3 to 0.5 % depending on the species, whereas the same threshold of 0.1% should apply to all species. Such a threshold is crucial in order to guarantee the purity of the variety and the traceability and labelling of all seeds throughout the production chain; and to keep some sectors truly GMO-free. The liability of those who introduce GMOs into the environment, and I am thinking in particular here of the seed industry, including European companies, must be clearly established in accordance with the ‘polluter pays’ principle. In other words, the cost of remedying the damage must be borne by GMO farming. Since it is impossible to determine the precise contamination range of pollen produced by a genetically modified plant, it will be in the interest of the producers of these plants to have good insurance, unless they are able to train bees to gather pollen very selectively.

 Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the mid-term review has nevertheless been quite an adventure and it is no bad thing that we, the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, have arrived at a possible compromise, which might, it seems to me, satisfy farmers. We wanted the policy directions to be clear to all and that is why we have given the Cunha report a clear introduction. For us Greens, the positive aspect of this compromise is that it strengthens rural development. The thorough grooming proposed today allows European farmers to keep the positive aspects of multifunctionality by strengthening rural development, the system of modulation allowing them to pass from the first to the second pillar. I am thinking in particular of Amendment No 44 to Article 12. This proposed modulation uses a territorial criterion for the application of different percentage points, taking account of less-favoured areas. Indeed, as the rapporteur says in his justification, the objective must be to consolidate the structure of producer organisations. Moreover, this amendment obliges States to commit themselves to rural development, since they will only get 100% of the EAGGF Guarantee amounts if they commit themselves to obligatory national co-financing. I am sure that will encourage States to correctly finance all the social, food quality and environmental aspects of rural development. The territorial farming contracts model introduced by France was an excellent precursor from this point of view. It should be noted, since it is essential for the future, that Member States may use this modulation to fund their national contribution for the so very necessary establishment of young farmers. Similarly, States may – and in our opinion must – chose to finance the compensatory payments to less-favoured areas and to areas subject to environmental constraints or agro-environmental measures – all this without affecting the overall amount allocated by the State to the second pillar. This strengthening of rural development is therefore a step in the right direction for two very good reasons: the first is to consolidate good farming practices, more extensive practices, protecting the health of the consumer, respecting the environment and biodiversity and producing a good social added value; the second is to protect the rural world from the vicissitudes of the aggressive commercial liberalism advocated by the WTO. Thus, the multifunctional specifics of European agriculture or the exploitation of products specific to a particular region will still be able to be paid for under the second pillar, which affords the best protection for small producers in less-favoured areas. In addition, there is the difference between the degression of direct payments to fragile areas (6%) and other areas (8%). If it is to remain meaningful, this strengthening of the second pillar must preserve the milk quotas which have proved their effectiveness in safeguarding mountain stock farming. We must also protect and consolidate natural pasture land, but more than that we must continue to support the fodder and, more generally, the protein crops necessary for healthy, high-quality stock farming – the alfalfa mentioned by Mr Souchet – and maintain the necessary schemes. It ought to be possible to grow protein crops on all frozen land since Europe is in deficit in them and growing vegetable protein is also beneficial for the quality of the soil and the environment and for the quality of animal feed. On the sensitive issue of decoupling, we had to decide between those who supported total decoupling and those who wanted none. We feel that the compromise of going a step at a time opens up a perspective that everyone can accept.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s positive intention is to tidy up ten directives, the first of which dates from 1966, concerning Community comparative tests and trials for various conventional seeds and propagating material. As the Commission has confirmed over the past twenty-five years, agricultural crops such as cereals, fodder crops, and oilseed and fibre crops have been subject to Community comparative tests on the basis of the applicable legislation. Over the last few years, this exercise has grown in importance following new legislation on the marketing of propagating material of fruit, vegetables and ornamental plants, which lays down detailed rules for implementing the Community comparative tests. This post-control system for seed and propagating material marketed in the Community is recognised as being an extremely important tool for the harmonisation of marketing by Member States. The planned tidying-up exercise, however, would be neither complete nor relevant if the comparative tests funded by the European Union were limited to currently certified seed and plants included in the Union’s common catalogue. The Commission’s proposal must take into account the recently adopted legislative provisions in the area of processed products, as regards the adventitious or technically unavoidable presence of genetically modified seed in conventional varieties of seed. Moreover, it seems to me that in order to update these directives properly three objectives have to be achieved. First of all the proposal must cover all existing seed, so as to have a complete range which takes into account, in addition to traditional seed, the special requirements of biodiversity, and the effects of introducing biotechnology via GMOs. Secondly, it must include within its scope the so-called ‘amateur’ varieties, covered by Directive 98/95, which is still not taken into account by all Member States. Thirdly, for the sake of democracy, it must enable Parliament to be involved in the decision-making process right the way through from beginning to end. In this sense, the sensitive issue of the risk of contamination of traditional seed by GMOs must be included in the series of directives concerning the marketing of seed with which we are dealing here today. This issue cannot be dealt with by the committee procedure, because that would exclude Members of the European Parliament from the debate and prevent them from making proposals on this subject. If I may return briefly to my first point, the comparative tests funded by the European Union should not be limited to the species included in the common catalogue. Conservation varieties and seed originating in organic farming should benefit from these tests. They have to be tested in conditions which correspond to these farming systems and they therefore require more funding. It should be pointed out such seed is not allowed to be coated and must be absolutely free from any trace of GMOs. Tests of the same type are necessary for plants at risk of GMO contamination. In effect, this proposal for a directive provides an opportunity to settle issues regarding the proven presence of genetically modified seed in conventional seed. The Commission has been working for some considerable time on a directive which would legislate on additional conditions and requirements regarding the presence of genetically modified seed in batches of seed, planting sites, and details of the marking of such seed. Unfortunately, the draft of the latest directive does not sufficiently take into account Directive 2001/18 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms, which has come into force in the meantime. To come back to my second point, it is important that the conservation species and varieties referred to in Directive 98/95 should be defined and tested for marketing in accordance with special criteria, and that will require an implementing regulation, something which we are still waiting for. In the same way, farm-saved seed or seed of local origin ought to be able to benefit from special flexibility and should be the subject of special contracts linked to Directive 98/95. When it comes to my third point, this is where the democratic debate plays an important role. In the modified articles it is important to decline, as I have tried to do, to make any reference to precise traceability. It is therefore important to say, for each type of seed individually, that if accidental or technically unavoidable traces of GMOs are present in that seed, it is possible to set a threshold level, below which the seed can nonetheless be placed on the market. The level of that threshold should be established in accordance with Article 21 and set at the lowest possible level allowed in accordance with state-of-the-art scientific knowledge. Moreover, appropriate measures must be taken during the transport and storage of traditional seed, so that the accidental or technically unavoidable nature of any GMO pollution can be proved. In fact, although the directive already lays down that genetically modified seed must be labelled, it does not provide a solution to the problem of the risk of traces in traditional seeds, the rule being that such seed must not, in principle, contain any GMOs. This rule is extremely important to farming, because the spread of contaminated seed may have unforeseeable economic consequences, both for farmers and for food producers. Finally, the directive already lays down that the Community may make a financial contribution to the carrying out of the tests laid down in Paragraphs 1 and 2. The same treatment should be possible for the special comparative tests needed for seed and plants produced and cultivated for organic farming and for the utilisation and conservation of genetic diversity in plants. For the sake of transparency, therefore, it will be necessary in future to establish a clear legal basis for a financial contribution, of whatever kind, and it is therefore necessary to make provision for Community financial measures which will be applicable to these comparative tests and which will include the necessary obligatory Community budget expenditure.

 Mr President March 2002, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is effectively eEurope 
that is in the hot seat this evening, if I may say so, and I shall in particular address the full roll-out of third-generation mobile communications. The debate has been very poorly organised, Commissioner, for we began with the Van Velzen report, which is mainly complementary insofar as it concerns information that will be added to third-generation GSMs, such as meteorological information or information on roads provided by the public sector. All things considered, it does not matter very much since, furthermore, the aim of third-generation GSMs is also to avoid the digital divide, which Mr Paasilinna will strongly criticise. All in all, therefore, it is perfectly normal for us to have this kind of joint debate. It should perhaps be pointed out that the March 2002 Barcelona Council stated: ‘Technological convergence affords all business and citizens new opportunities for access to the Information Society. Digital television and third-generation mobile communications (3G) will play a key role in providing widespread access to interactive services’. This sector of the third generation, however, seems to be in difficulties. Perhaps, in order to avoid the digital divide and to avoid breaking the continuity of eEurope, it should be said that 3G services must be established within a global framework, but we must also add the important issues of consumer health and environmental quality. We must also learn from the experience of the current GSM market in order to avoid reproducing the mistakes that might have been made in the past. One key aspect of mobile telephony development is the interoperability of terminals. In this area, the Commission would point out that progress was made in the development of 3G terminals in 2002. The first models are ready. They are also ready in China, and I am pointing this out to you because we received this information last week. Furthermore, the existing 2G networks have been modernised to make them 2.5G. Some technical problems may persist, but we can say that everything is working. With regard to the market situation, the current availability of 3G services in Europe is not clear. They are available in Japan, but the operators are confident, and, after all, since around 50 operators are capable of offering these services, the problem of competition is solved. It can exist. With regard to regulatory issues, the Commission would point out that the procedure for granting 3G licences has begun in all the countries of the European Union. This number of licences is sufficient. There is therefore no problem as far as the competitive environment is concerned. Following discussions with the parties concerned with the introduction of 3G mobile communications, a consensus was reached on three points. First of all, the introduction phase for 3G services does not require legislative intervention. Market forces must be allowed to take effect. Secondly, 3G communications will, in the long term, have to become one of the platforms for services provided by a global Information Society. Lastly, the public authorities must provide constant support in the introduction process. Three factors have therefore been identified: a stable, harmonised, transparent regulatory environment, taking account of consumer interests; the proactive supporting role that the Union can play and, thirdly, long-term initiatives, taking account of what has happened in the 3G communications sector, in particular with a view to enlargement. We therefore need to increase coordination of all these decisions. The Commission believes that no changes will be required in the granting of licences and that the period of validity of licences will not be altered in the short term. The legislation does, however, require clarification in terms of network infrastructure sharing. As rapporteur, I therefore feel that the Commission has judged the matter correctly in terms of the economy, but that a number of points should have been added. This technology is expensive and could be rivalled, for example, by WiFi, which means that today, it is not clear whether 3G communications will take over part of what information technology is currently doing or if, on the contrary, information technology will gradually replace what GSMs are doing. Ultimately, it is the market that will decide, but it is good to raise the question and be prepared. Generally speaking, access to 3G services must be clear to all and users with difficulties must be protected; for example, children and people with disabilities might need specific packages. Lastly, secure payment must be protected, or the consumer will have no confidence in this system. I shall now discuss the precautionary principle, which Members from the right, furthermore, wanted to dispose of. I want to discuss the health problems that can arise, for they are now raised by numerous scientists. A consensual request was made that the requirements of the World Health Organisation should at least be respected at European level. We are told that this is now the case, but it still remains to be verified. Lastly, the construction of 3G aerial repeaters should take place with due respect for the environment and land use planning. The Member States will ensure that authorisations from the land use planning departments are subject to a clear procedure and a public enquiry. Four to sixteen times more aerials are needed for third-generation communications than for 2G. Colocation or aerial sharing, as recommended by the Commission, is therefore extremely important. In conclusion, regulatory stability will enable this technology to develop smoothly if the European Union gives the same importance to social and environmental parameters as to economic parameters.

Mr President, Commissioner, I am delighted to see that you give equal status to Porto Alegre and Davos. The Greens, like Mr Désir and a few others, we who were behind the Porto Alegre parliamentary forum, are delighted to learn that alterglobalisation is beginning to find an echo among you. I believe that President Lula has, indeed, taken the right step, because he came to present first to Porto Alegre what he was going to defend in Davos, in other words, the reconstruction of a fairer economic order. I feel that this democratic, socially aware, political move is a step along the right road: civil society should have its say first and then the decision-makers of the global economy. Market capitalism cannot continue to be the dominant form of politics. I would remind you – even if this is perhaps a sophism – that democracy and politics normally take precedence over economic considerations. It is vital to prove this, as that would also make it possible to avoid a pre-emptive war such as that proposed by the Bush government, which is largely subservient to multinationals which have a far greater need for oil than for ideas. Lastly, these same multinationals want at all costs to reappropriate sustainable development and the common goods belonging to all mankind such as water, air and energy. It seems to me, however, that in Cancun, Commissioner, you should help us to defend our idea of globalisation. It is right that we should concern ourselves with current GATS negotiations, because they represent quite a risk, and it is right that the southern States should know that we support them with regard to each individual’s right to food, drinking water and breathable air.

 Mr President, Commissioner, agriculture will certainly be one of the most sensitive issues at Cancun. When all is said and done, agriculture represents an economic and social market framework the countries of the Southern hemisphere can only dream of. You are mandated to bear the European Union’s great responsibility in this field. I believe the countries of the south should consider the Union their staunchest ally. We must therefore ensure that every person’s fundamental right to have food is not sacrificed on the altar of the god of trade and financial transactions. When it comes down to it, agriculture is an indicator of public welfare the world over, as was stated a moment ago. For the countries of the south, it involves food security, and also the quality of food, water and the soil. It means recognition of regional products, the preservation of the landscape and the sustainable development of rural areas. All this applies to the countries of the north as well as to the countries of the south. Hence, as you said, your mandate should demonstrate there is no selfishness on our part, and that we are willing to eliminate a number of export subsidies. These subsidies are also ruining small farmers within the European Union. The right of peoples and countries to feed themselves with local, healthy products should allow them to take protectionist measures when necessary. If your safeguard clause reflects this right, it will go hand-in-hand with fair-trade, and would be a welcome extension of the ‘Everything but arms’ initiative.

 Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, you have seen the extent to which the resolution tabled by Mr Daul represents the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in all its political hues. I believe that should be of concern to you, President-in-Office of the Council, at a time when the Brussels Council is deciding on enlargement, but when, at the same time, it is freezing the agriculture budget until 2013. We do not want to believe that what has been discussed, in particular with regard to the mid-term review, might be called into question and become obsolete, because the representatives of the Council have a variety of interests. President-in-Office of the Council, your comments have indeed been extremely soothing, but they will not suffice to anaesthetise us. When the Council speaks of rural development or sustainable development, this is clearly nothing more than rhetoric. If we really want to carry out rural development, you will have to tell us sooner or later when it will be possible to move from 10% funding to the 20% funding proposed by Commissioner Fischler and approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development as a whole. If we continue to be so vague, what does that mean? Will we in fact have the means to implement our policy if modulation is not restrictive? How, then, will we effectively be able to continue to carry out ecoconditionality, land-use planning, and address social issues? This will not be possible if you do not actually provide the means to implement this policy. Will we really be able to hold a proper debate and carry weight in the WTO as of 2003 if we cannot prove, for example to the developing countries, that the model Europe is creating is truly a model of multifunctionality that respects both mankind and the environment, and not a form of trade in disguise?

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank Mrs Paulsen for having conducted this conciliation – which was not easy – with such panache, and for thus enabling us to reach a good compromise today. As Commissioner Vitorino said, the challenge is still how to protect ourselves against BSE. It is as if we have almost forgotten that this was the main problem and that this is what was behind all the directives that we have been adopting recently in the field of food safety. We are prohibiting the recycling of animal carcasses and condemned animal by-products into the food chain, we are banning animal ‘cannibalism’, this is a positive step. Food traceability has been improved. Lastly, we are preventing cross-contamination. This is all well and good but there is, unfortunately, a down side, because although we have certainly made progress in eliminating food waste, I think that the obligation imposed on Member States is being partly deferred. A transitional period has been proposed which, as previous speakers have said, is too long. Two years was certainly long enough for us to resolve these problems. For example, oils can produce biomass for biofuels etc. Yet, some States will be virtuous and take the necessary measures as soon as possible, whilst others will wait until the very last minute, until 2006, by using the comitology procedure. This is a very unpleasant reminder of what happened at the peak of the BSE crisis, when some States claimed not to have any cases of mad cow disease because they were not doing any tests. When they started to carry out the tests, they detected cases of mad cow disease. Yet, these same States today are not, in my view, being particularly reasonable. We must speed up the process.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the major challenge of this directive – and this is what the Commission desires – is to achieve clear labelling, for both food products as well as animal feed and enzymes. We must reiterate that when we eat animals, we are eating the food that they themselves consumed. Consumers therefore want to know, and many farmers also want to know, what animals eat. Since, initially, I had been appointed draftsman on this issue as a member of the Committee on Agriculture, I felt obliged not to table this opinion on my behalf, such was the desire of my fellow Members – and Mrs Redondo, an inveterate productivist and defender of genetically manipulated organisms, pointed this out earlier – to confuse the debate. I am therefore delighted to be able to support Mrs Scheele and the Committee on the Environment, who are not only demanding clear labelling but are lowering the traceability threshold to 0.5%. Scientists are now telling us that they can detect food containing 0.01% of GMOs. If we therefore want to give consumers clear information on what they want to know, it is indeed possible. The second thing that we must not forget, above all else, is that the requirements must be the same for imported products, so that the consumer has reassurance on products which are from outside and on products which are produced within the European Union. It is on this basis, and this basis alone, that we will effectively manage to reassure and to reconcile consumers and producers.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have just arrived and I am delighted to speak on the biofuels dossier, which I worked on for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. It seems that the debate on biofuels has, in a way, put the cart before the horse, in the sense that this is, first and foremost, an agricultural problem and that it would have been more sensible to wait for the assessment of the Berlin agenda to be completed, in other words, to complete the mid-term review, so that we know exactly which direction to take for the biofuels policy. The quality of biofuel production will primarily be determined by the way in which agriculture will be managed and this is what we must bear in mind, above all else, in dealing with this subject. The biofuels in question can be manufactured using a production-based approach, with GMOs, with per-hectare inputs, but the overall ecological impact would then be negative. On the other hand, if we take the logical approach, the one which the common agricultural policy has followed for some time now, in other words, if we practise greater crop rotation and if we respect the environment as we should, then biofuels and biofuel production could become a valuable extra activity for farmers involved in direct production. It is better to produce pure biodiesel, pure oil or use biomass to produce hydrogen rather than to follow an approach whereby a small percentage of fuel of agricultural origin is blended with fuels which are themselves still fossil fuels and are therefore still products that produce a great deal of pollution during production. This line of thinking leads to an approach, which, in our view, is heading in the right direction. And since the proposed approach seems satisfactory, we shall study in detail the final decision that is taken.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I am taking the floor once again on behalf of my fellow Member, Mr Dominique Souchet, who was the other draftsman in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and who worked on the fiscal aspects. I shall not return to the political argument but, as you know, market forces dictate that, for two major reasons, biofuels cannot currently be developed spontaneously in the European Union. The first reason is that the price of fossil fuels does not include external costs generated, firstly, by the use of a non-renewable resource – namely, oil – and secondly, by very high greenhouse gas emissions. The second reason is that oil companies benefit from the advantage of having a century’s worth of industrial experience, which has enabled them to optimise industrial costs on an enormous scale. It is therefore perfectly legitimate for Member States to use differentiated taxation – a formula which we believe to be much fairer than considering cuts in excise duty – taxation that would encourage the competitiveness of fuels of plant origin, which are renewable and do not contribute to the greenhouse effect. It would therefore be a matter of transforming excise duty on car fuels into a type of eco-tax that would be higher for fossil fuels than for renewable fuels due to the punitive external costs of fossil fuels. The Commission’s tax proposal should help to enable the European Union to meet the objective set out in the Green Paper on the security of energy supply, namely of achieving 20% use of substitute fuels in road transport by the year 2020. The amendments adopted in the Committee on Agriculture seek to make this Directive more effective, by emphasising that the by-products of biofuels produced in the European Union provide materials that are rich in plant protein which can be used in animal feed; by abolishing the totally arbitrary limit of 50% of the tax differential; by abolishing the time limit of 31 December 2010, since the external costs in the oil sector are permanent; by applying complete tax exemption to fuels used in biofuel production, which is already the case in the manufacture of oil products; by pointing out that cuts in excise duty can only apply to biofuels produced in the European Union, otherwise the European Union would not benefit from either reduced greenhouse gas emissions or from protein fodder crops that are produced as a by-product.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Cunha quite rightly said, this report is an extremely political document, despite the fact that it appears to be technical. It raises the key question as to whether we should continue to subsidise the cultivation of a plant, the main use of which is in the manufacture of a product recognised as being extremely harmful to human health. Tobacco, I am sorry to say, is a hard drug, and we must have the courage to say this. The problem dates back a long way and the Commission is using this proposal for updating the regulation to clearly say that we must move away from the system of tobacco subsidies. However, as we must give farmers the time to change activity, the debate initially focuses on the time they are given to do this. And Mr Cunha’s proposal was, from that point of view, very reasonable. It is natural to allow them time – but not too much time – for the planned assessment. The Greens believe that the current situation must be tackled now, whether or not we are continually told that these are poor farmers. As far as I know, Alsace and Andalucia are, in terms of farming, fairly prosperous regions. The question is to determine whether, at this point, we must subsidise, in other countries, growing dangerous products such as cannabis, for example. And we must, at this point, have the courage to say so. There are two points to the second question which is that of the Community Tobacco Fund. The first point is the level of the deduction to be introduced as of 2004; the second is the tasks given to researchers who are funded in this way. We believe that an increase from 3% to 5% for this Fund is a positive step; in this area, the Commission’s proposal has very wisely used the carrot and stick approach in order to refocus these tasks over the long term and to replace agronomic research into making tobacco slightly less harmful with measures to support specific initiatives that encourage tobacco growers to switch from tobacco into other crops. We must not forget, however, that products other than the cigarette can be produced from tobacco. It can be an aid to medical research, for example. It is also an excellent natural insecticide. But these are specialist niches, and there is a great deal too much cultivated tobacco for these uses. The Greens will not, therefore, vote in favour of the amendments which have undermined Mr Cunha’s patient work. Instead, we will support the Commission in this area.

 Mr President, you will understand that, as a member of the Greens, it is particularly moving to be presenting this resolution as co-author, since Ingrid Bétancour is still currently being detained by members of the FARC, the violent paramilitary gang which has previously carried out assassinations of trade unionists or representatives of social movements from Colombian society. My fellow Members have reiterated how much the Colombian people need peace and tranquillity, rather than this type of action. Today, we still do not have any news regarding Mrs Bétancour’s situation which could put our minds at rest. The governments involved and the Commission must therefore try to obtain some information and assist in Mrs Bétancour’s release. But apart from this, as other speakers have said, we must welcome the statement by President Pastrana, who stated that he wanted to step up his fight against this type of action and provide effective guarantees for the security of the civil society in Colombia. It is perfectly clear that, if President Pastrana leaves the door to negotiations open, then these negotiations must relate to the respect of human rights and restoring order in Colombia so that genuine democracy can finally be established in this country. The European Union must therefore provide greater support for cooperation efforts, which will improve the human rights situation, and it must ensure that the European aid achieves its objective, in other words to assist civil society in Colombia.

 Mr President, Tunisia made a commitment to respect human rights and it is a key element of the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement. We now believe, however, that these undertakings, which were reiterated at the Association Council session of 29 January, have been flouted by the way in which Hamma Hammami and his co-defendants are being treated by the Tunisian Government. The defendants, who voluntarily came out of hiding, a state in which they were forced to live following their infamous trials in 1997 and 1998, were again convicted on 2 February before the Court of First Instance and their sentence was confirmed in a farcical judicial hearing which, unfortunately, confirms the serious defects in the rule of law that has been in force in Tunisia for several years. Two hundred lawyers gathered in support of the defence. They were set upon by the police and the prisoners were violently assaulted. Hamma Hammami began a hunger strike on 26 February to protest against the conditions in which he is being detained. He was moved to the area in Tunis prison that is reserved for those sentenced to death, despite the fact that he is a political prisoner. This situation is in breach of the Treaties, particularly Article 2 of the Association Agreement with the European Union on the respect of human rights. It is now crucial that, a few weeks before the start of the Conference on Foreign Affairs (Barcelona V), which is being held in Valencia on 22 and 23 April, we, as Members of the European Parliament, call upon the Tunisian authorities to release Hamma Hammami and his co-defendants. This is a first step which is essential for the respect of the rule of law in Tunisia. We also call on the Commission to demand that the Tunis authorities comply with international law and to instruct its parliamentary delegation to raise this subject more firmly with the Tunisian Government.

 Mr President, Commissioner, due to a complaint from a customer in Maryland, who found Mediterranean fruit fly larvae in clementines, the United States took harsh unilateral measures with regard to Spain. In fact, as you know, it is not a plant health problem but a trade barrier that the United States has now established. It is true, as Mr Jové Peres stressed, that the Spanish Government lost time by failing to inform the Commission immediately and instead waited until 14 February to do so, despite the fact that the problem came to light in November 2001. But the problem exists and Morocco is also currently experiencing the same problem for the same reasons. The fly that bit the American Government, if I can put it like that, is more of an electioneering insect rather than a citrus fruit parasite from the Mediterranean. The attitude of the United States towards clementines is the same as it is towards steel products, as my fellow Members have already said. It marks a return to protectionist ways and to unilateralism with complete disregard for WTO obligations. The United States cannot carry on closing their borders when faced with the urgency of the elections or ignore the WTO agreements when the European Union poses them problems. Therefore, as recommended by the resolution, I call on the Commission to instigate proceedings at the WTO against the United States if an immediate solution to the situation is not found. Next, the Commission must present proposals to compensate the people affected, until the conflict is resolved. Lastly, the Council should inform us, through its President-in-Office of the Council, of the latest initiatives that it is taking to resolve this conflict.

 Commissioner, in the same vein as my fellow Members, I would like to draw some comparisons between New York and Porto Alegre. At the same time as a weak and unimaginative summit was being held in New York, attended by financiers and decision-makers, the so-called winners, in short, all kinds of wealthy people, three lively forums were being held, for the second time, in Porto Alegre which was the true alternative to Davos. The three forums were attended by people from towns, from civil society and by parliamentarians, who cast a critical eye over the whole world. And this is how – and I sympathise with my colleague from the Liberal party, as the Greens are very happy to do this – the inventiveness of future governance is being created. On the one hand, therefore, everyone in New York was shedding crocodile tears over the attacks of 11 September, not so much because of the unfortunate people who lost their lives but because of the resultant economic downturn. On the other hand, in Brazil, everyone was genuinely turning their attention to the real risks of terrorism and the poverty-stricken situation of poor countries to try to find helpful solutions. If I have to mention some of the highlights, ladies and gentlemen, I would choose a debt tribunal, which is lending support throughout the crisis in Argentina, which outlined the extent of the devastating effects caused by the structural adjustment policies and the burden of debt. This is a subject to which Europe should give greater attention. Europe must assist the countries of the South in making their voice heard at the UN, so that the interests of debt-ravaged countries are finally taken into account, and not simply the interests of the creditor countries. We are still waiting for the European Union to unilaterally abolish the debts of the countries of the south. This would be a strong signal, which would be meaningful. Commissioner, I believe that you could send this signal. Most importantly, I attended the parliamentary forum for the second year running and was pleased to see that many Members of the European Parliament had travelled to Porto Alegre to build up this global network of parliamentarians who support social movements. The more of us who gather from different political and geographical backgrounds, the better we can convey the message of the people; the more of us who already have the legitimate right to universal suffrage, the easier we can influence governments that are all too often more concerned about taking up a seat at a New York-style Davos Summit than about understanding the legitimate ideas of the world’s population. Rest assured, then, that we returned inspired by our discussions and by the contacts we made at the social forum. We shall therefore continue to press the Commission and the Council on challenging subjects such as the feasibility of the Tobin-style tax, the overwhelming responsibilities of the rich countries in the area of climate change, the right of the Palestinian and the Israeli people to live in freedom and in dignity, the right of everyone to a basic aspect of safety, food safety, which is the right to sufficient food and to have access to drinking water.

Given that eight people recently lost their lives in tragic circumstances and that you, Madam President, often invite us to show our respect for those who are victims of violence by observing a minute’s silence, we should, naturally, observe a minute’s silence tomorrow morning at the opening of the sitting, for the eight people who recently died at the hands of evil traffickers.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will, in effect, vote in favour of the Whitehead report. The European Food Safety Authority, an essential food safety mechanism serving the consumers and the political authorities of Europe alike, is essential to the performance of the functions that it will be assigned. Its first task is to investigate all the failings that led to the recent food safety crises, both the crises in the food business, such as chicken dioxins, food and mouth disease, trafficking in veterinary products, the excessive use of vaccines and tranquillisers on animals and also the original BSE crisis. I would point out that even Finland now has its first case of mad cow disease. That is the first point I would like to make. My second point is that it is the agency that must also stop the uncontrolled spread of contaminating transgenic products that are even infesting traditional cereal crops, since consumers are rejecting transgenic crops, whose only virtues are commercial. Therefore, this agency must also, other than resolving all those problems, ensure food safety from the farm to the fork. In order to do so, the Food Safety Authority must apply, from the beginning of 2002, the principles of transparency and monitoring that my fellow Members have already mentioned. The failings in the area of hygiene as being the sole criterion, which has been highlighted in the many crises that we have listed, particularly in animal feed, shows that the agency must give advice on good practice, on labelling, on products that have been produced locally, that contain dairy products, instead of dealing with industrial standards alone, which do not prevent salmonella, listeria or any of the more distressing epidemics. Its main function is therefore to coordinate the national agencies, and to do so, the agency must be independent and transparent. On the other hand, I have doubts regarding Amendment No 34, which deals with the appointment procedure to the Management Board, a process that seems hazy at best, since it refers to the meritocracy of the Management Board. So what exactly does meritocracy mean in an agency that should be composed of experts in the relevant scientific fields? The Management Board has a political and managerial role. I very much fear that this meritocracy is simply a way of masking the pressure exerted by large food corporations. I hope that the Commissioner will be able to reassure me on this point. As for where the agency will be based, we believe this is a side issue… (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, I would like to point out two mistakes that need to be corrected in the French language version. In Paragraph 10 of the French version, it says ‘Treaty infringement procedures against Member States’, which is a misinterpretation. What is meant is ‘Treaty infringement proceedings against Member States’. In Paragraph 16 of the French version, it says ‘calls on the Commission to examine ways of promoting small-scale, local culling’. Mr President, in order to avoid more serious culling, I propose – this sounds like a film called ‘Petits meurtres entre amis’ – I propose therefore that we put ‘small, local abattoirs’.

 – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank Harlem Désir for the quality of this report, which, of course, I fully support. The point that you made just now, Commissioner, on developments within the WTO to my mind shows all the more the need for such a report. I shall use two points to try to illustrate this. The Commission must keep a close eye on the issues of agriculture and intellectual property, so that the current shifts we are seeing within the WTO do not continue indefinitely. The dice have been and remain loaded against the weakest, either the poorest countries or the most endangered social categories in our own countries, because the WTO is a body that is neither transparent nor democratic. Let us take the example of the Marrakech Agreements on agriculture. They guarantee neither self-sufficiency with regard to food supply nor the right to protect biodiversity for the southern countries. They prevent the specific nature of small-scale farming in Europe from being taken into consideration, with all its quality, social and environmental aspects. There is a danger that, in the near future, they may ban small farmers from sowing the seeds that they have themselves produced. The Commission must exert pressure to change this, to have an in-depth review of the Trips agreement drawn up so that it is fully compatible with the Rio convention on biodiversity and the Cartagena protocol on biosecurity, as the African group within the WTO is calling for. This will enable us to preserve the biological heritage of the developing countries and the traditional skills in the south as well as the north. Furthermore, the patenting of living organisms must be prohibited, because these are the heritage of all humanity and cannot and must not be hijacked by private interests that want to turn life into a commodity. I hope, Commissioner, that you will convey this message.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Whitehead’s report on the setting up of a European Food Authority to be responsible for food safety appears to us to be moving in the right direction, both in its analysis of the situation which led to the proposal to create this authority and as regards the tasks that will be assigned to the authority and the proposed method of ensuring that it operates in the best possible way. We must remember that this initiative is the result, unfortunately, of a series of repeated scandals connected, on the one hand, with the desire to increase agricultural productivity and, on the other, with the monopoly enjoyed by the major distributors, which have led to health-conscious, industrial farming but have not prevented the development of scandalous trends such as chicken containing dioxin, trafficking in veterinary products of all kinds, and in particular the fundamental crisis of BSE. Putting all these things right is one of the main objectives of this agency, in order to safeguard the health and safety of the consumer all the way from the farm to the fork. It must play a double role, on the one hand ensuring safety along the whole length of the food chain, and on the other hand guaranteeing the quality of all products intended for the consumer. In order to do this, it will operate at an earlier stage in the process than the institutions, because every citizen must have the right to healthy, safe food. Moreover, like those in the industry itself, it must be aware of the rules that this implies and of the costs that it represents. At the beginning of next year, in order to apply the principles of transparency and completely independent monitoring, the Food Authority will have to propose the principles which this document correctly sets out. It must be able to provide analytical input on any product, including any genetically modified organisms, vaccinations and pesticides which might at any moment enter the food chain. The failure of public health awareness as the only reference criterion has been proved following the scandal of animal meal. Such an agency must be able to set out a list of measures constituting good practice, of labels for products having special local characteristics, and of farm-type qualities, rather than merely industrial standards which cannot prevent either salmonella or alarming epidemics. Its main mission is above all to serve as a coordinator for the national agencies, so as to ensure that they all recognise the same references and so that their role in providing scientific evaluation and preventing risks is sufficiently well publicised. Of course it will have to require the same controls and traceability rules for all the countries of the Union, whether for their exports, their imports or their own consumption. As for where it should be located, this is of little importance provided that transparency and traceability are observed by everyone concerned.

 Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am also extremely disappointed by this answer. What you are saying is that there is no room for innovation in financial matters, in spite of the volatility of the markets, in spite of the bad reaction to the crises which have hit us recently, including the crisis in Asia. How can we meet our commitments with regard to sustainable development which you encourage, as President-in-Office of the Council, when we know what it already costs the European Union? What is it going to cost and how is sustainable development going to be funded in developing countries? How are renewable energy sources going to be funded, how are we going to finance access to drinking water for the whole world, and lastly, how are we going to finance the elimination of dangerous waste? How are we going to take action, because it appears that merely raising the issue of managing various flows of money seems, in your view, to be impossible.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we have already said, the backdrop to Mr Sturdy’s report is the dramatic context, both for farmers and consumers, we should remember, of the BSE crisis and the resources put in place to eradicate it. Commissioner, one of the seven measures that you proposed several months ago is today being proposed for implementation. This is, in addition to using set-aside land to grow protein plants, a step in the right direction, even if, in the opinion of the Group of the Greens, it is still not enough. Mr Sturdy has tried to push the Commission position on farmers further, by dealing with other aspects of beef production. On the other hand, he has not considered a serious problem of fraud in the BSE crisis. Now, Commissioner, I suppose that you too have seen the latest report by AFSSA (the French Agency for Food Safety), which has been well-documented and is damning on this issue. It shows that the cases of animals suffering from BSE, described as naïve and, more often, extremely dumb, are caused by the fraudulent use of bone meal from carcasses in animal foods. We therefore need urgent measures to step up checks and sanctions. The health of consumers depends on this, as does consumer confidence. The second point that I would like to draw your attention to is that the measures proposed by the Commission are moving towards extensification whilst relieving a saturated market, but there is a risk that the special premium for cutting headage of male cattle per hectare will have no effect unless a ceiling is imposed on surface areas, since the advocates of high productivity may attempt to claw back this premium, which is not intended for them, by increasing surface areas, which are, in any case, already high in their case. We should therefore do our best to encourage small holdings, which are endangered and threatened by the latest food crises, and this is what I hope you will soon be doing.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we should do, this evening especially, is to enable the remarkable report by Mrs Roth-Behrendt to be implemented as quickly as possible, in other words, to enable the measures to take effect from July. On the basis of scientific knowledge, which is increasing every day, I do believe that the two amendments that have been proposed to us are ambiguous and are more likely to slow down the implementation of these measures than to have a positive impact. My group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, could conceivably support the first amendment, because classifying countries according to the number of suspected cases is a good approach and because the most crucial task is, above all, to monitor the infectious disease. Whether or not the countries that feel most vulnerable want to protect themselves, this is not necessarily a form of neo-protectionism. On the other hand, Amendment No 2 seems to be slightly excessive, seeking, on the pretext that animals under 24 months do not pose exactly the same problems as other animals, to eliminate the systematic use of rapid screening tests and to allow other countries, particularly Great Britain – the country that initiated this and the most affected – not to carry out systematic screening. If that is the intention behind the amendment, we in the Group of the Greens are totally opposed to it. Since this debate is evolving continually, I will add that, as Mrs Doyle has just said, we are asking ourselves questions about Canada or the United States. No country is today able to say that it is free from BSE or TSE and, more importantly, we should now have screening for sheep, since it is obvious today that the disease was definitely spread from them and that it is better to monitor this type of livestock, which can also pose the same problems that we have had with cattle.

 Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I just want to thank all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. They voted unanimously for the six amendments that allow this report to go beyond the Commission’s proposal, which only sought to unfreeze land for organic farmers and primarily to remain within the context of the COM agreements. The whole of Parliament wanted to go further and send a positive signal to breeders generally and also, at least initially, to farmers doing environmental work. I venture to hope, on behalf of my group, and no doubt on behalf of many others, that the Council will understand and follow our lead in the matter.

 Mr President, Commissioner, to ensure that the first harvest can be gathered after 15 August 2001, against the difficult background of the BSE crisis and as a matter of urgency, the Commission has been prompted to propose amendments to the Council Regulation establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops. This proposal is one of the measures in the seven-point plan being submitted to Parliament by the Commission which would enable certain land which is currently set aside to be put back into cultivation for crops such as clover. This decision to amend the Regulation as a matter of urgency will be seen by producers as a sign of hope. Europe is not abandoning them and does not want them to carry the can for a situation of which they are very often the victims. Aside from its urgency, this measure follows on directly from the White Paper on food safety which included in its proposals the incorporation of problems associated with the production of animal feed. The proposal also addresses the problem of the production of vegetable protein needed to ensure suitable feedingstuffs for bovine animals. There is a deficit in such production in Europe as a result, inter alia
, of the Blair House agreements. The set-aside arrangements laid down resulted in arable land lying fallow while, at the same time, livestock were being fed on animal protein, including some from animal meal. In order to enable all livestock to be once again fed with more wholesome feedingstuffs, and in order to overcome the BSE crisis, it is essential that the set-aside arrangements be amended so as to encourage production of fodder crops. Your proposal, Commissioner, admittedly constitutes a step in the right direction, although the change proposed is only marginal in relation to the Regulation as a whole. The change is of simply symbolic value but we in this House could go further and use it as the trigger for a debate leading to the eventual reform of Agenda 2000. The aim of the measures proposed is to move, initially, from set aside towards arrangements which are designed to increase crop rotation, but only in the organic farming sector. The effect of such arrangements would be to enhance the use of certain set-aside land by the planting of crops such as broad beans, kidney beans, lentils, chick peas, lupin, vetch, alfalfa, fenugreek, sweet clover, clover, white clover, field beans, peas and others. This would have a positive effect in terms of promoting a more natural approach to livestock rearing because it would be associated with the production of fodder. In addition, it would have a positive impact on the environment, since we now know that set aside is often harmful to the environment. Rather than encouraging mass production of protein and oleaginous crops and promoting rotation through payments linked to area or to volumes, this adjustment to the rules will allow the partial lifting of the set-aside requirement in order to grow fodder legumes not for human consumption. It represents a step in the direction of reform of the CAP along the lines of high-quality livestock farming and extensive production which we would all like to see. The question is whether this should be limited to boosting organic farming on the basis of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 or whether it is possible to go further. In the latter case, conventional farm holdings should be allowed to benefit from the same possibilities if they are willing to restrict themselves to planting only fodder crops on their set-aside land. The obligation to complement the growing of cereals with legumes and fodder crops in order to receive subsidies can thus contribute towards establishing ecological cycles and improving the soil. Such a commitment, associated with good farming practice, would permit the restoration of good rotation of crops, such as is found in organic farming. However, if we confine ourselves to lifting the set-aside requirement only for organic farming, we shall be making no more than cosmetic changes. The Commission made this proposal too restrictive by limiting set-aside production to organic farming, not through any admiration for organic farmers, but because it did not want to chip away at the WTO agreements by adopting a measure which would favour all EU producers. In fact, however, depending on the state of the crisis in health safety, under the WTO agreements, an amendment of the rules by Member States does not constitute a violation of its agreements, which the Economic and Social Committee also pointed out. Furthermore, if the health of consumers and the survival of farmers are at stake, it will be necessary to have the courage to review these agreements. George W. Bush had no qualms when he rejected the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. The crucial thing now is to take a quick initial decision to enable farmers to sow their crops as soon as possible. The best solution would have been to allow conventional farmers to sow set-aside land with protein crops before 15 August 2001, but the Commission did not accept this. Commissioner, a compromise has been put to you by the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for 2001 which, in addition to organic farming, concerns all agricultural holdings which take part in an agri-environment programme. Then, from 2002, this measure could be opened up to the conventional sector. This isolated proposal should be but a first step towards a more complete reform of the common agricultural policy.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, you have just given the entire history of a situation of generalised panic and – the truth must be stated – you have demonstrated to us the negative effects of globalisation. Now we see that states are banning trade in meat amongst each other. This proves that this crisis is, first and foremost, of a commercial nature. Let us stop seeing it as a health crisis. Let us stop mixing up the issues. Now, we no longer talk about another crisis which is also moving around the globe: that of BSE. Commissioner, what has happened to the tests? What has happened to the controls on meat and bone meal? These are questions which must be tackled alongside this crisis. Secondly, you are corrupting the precautionary principle. I am telling you this very politely as an ecologist. We are killing and burning animals on a massive scale, even though foot-and-mouth disease is not dangerous to humans. What is more, healthy animals can recover from foot-and-mouth disease. But it is not worthwhile commercially. So get things into perspective and propose valid solutions. Yes, you are slaughtering animals. Perhaps in the short term, and to get out of this crisis, it might be necessary to envisage a system which does not totally rule out vaccination in very restricted zones. The priority is to get out of the crisis. But once the crisis has passed, apply the precautionary principle and tackle the causes rather than the consequences. As you said at another time and in another place, you want to tackle the transportation of live animals, for example. It is not enough! Eight hours is too long to transport live animals! A stop must be put to this system. We must turn our backs on intensive and battery farming. Adopt long-term measures to put an end to this atrocious form of production and to return to extensive farming.

 Mr President, Commissioner, once again we face a tragic crisis, and I shall add two points to my fellow Members’ questions. Firstly, in answer to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, you stated that everything connected to fraud was actually within the jurisdiction of the Member States. While that may be true, the Commission must still ensure that there are sufficient staff resources to monitor this work. In that respect, what progress has been made by your directorate and the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate? However dedicated they are, do you have enough staff resources at the current time to adequately monitor all the urgent assignments they receive, this being the last problem in line following BSE and so many others? That is my first question. My second question is this: I feel you were rather quick to dismiss the fact that local abattoirs are not a solution to this type of problem, for small local abattoirs today are not what they were fifty years ago. Therefore, is the fact that they are local not a solution to the unfolding crises? This has been seen clearly in Great Britain, particularly with the problem of the long-distance transportation of animals, which apparently engenders and spreads the epidemic.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I have three brief questions. My first question is that you admittedly spoke about measures on organic farming, but what do you intend to do about all the certified and approved products, which are also subjected to very strict criteria? My second question relates to calves. What are you doing or what do you intend to do about rearing calves with their mother, because, currently, milk given to calves that are ‘battery farmed’ also presents problems that you have not considered. Lastly, my third question is what are you going to do to avoid measures likely to penalise only small farmers without affecting large farmers?

Mr President, Commissioner, speaking on behalf of the Greens at the time of the parliamentary resolution on the BSE crisis, I told you that the European countries which claimed to have no cases of mad-cow disease were the countries that were not looking for it. Alas, you will see that subsequent events have proved me right, as they often prove us right when we give timely warnings of the risks to which the earth and mankind are exposed by unbridled liberal economics, but our warnings are not heeded until the predicted disaster has come to pass. Today I can say that the BSE crisis has been underestimated by the Commission and, more especially, by the Member States. Under pressure from which lobby? Everyone in this Chamber knows that Europe's main mission since 1993 has been to operate as a large market without frontiers, a market where anything can be bought and sold, even infected meat and bone meal. Has this self-centred policy now been abandoned? I have returned from Porto Alegre, and I can tell you that the Brazilians and Argentinians whom I met there admit that they have been doing the same thing in various places, namely feeding animal carcasses to cattle. I very much fear that, if they started looking, they too would find cases of BSE. Be that as it may, fifteen years after the first case of mad-cow disease, Community decisions are still lagging several steps behind the disease. The last meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers was no exception to this rule. Instead of purely and simply banning the use of animal fat in certain forms, as the Scientific Veterinary Committee had tacitly suggested, the Council preferred to take a half-measure by prescribing heat treatment of fats. The update you have just presented to us, Commissioner Byrne, is disturbing on several counts. We have learned, for instance, that one Member State allows the inclusion of untreated specified-risk materials in feed mixes, that others are not managing to remove the spinal column at the abattoir and that some of the approved tests have turned out to be rather ineffective in the field. Lastly, I must ask some questions about the number of tests conducted by Member States, because some of the figures pose problems, such as those from Portugal, Greece and the United Kingdom, the country at the source of the epidemic, which conducts only 600 tests per day, as against 37 000 in Germany and 150 000 in Ireland, for example. What do you intend to do, Commissioner, to harmonise these campaigns properly, to ensure that the same level of protection against this epidemic is finally guaranteed throughout Europe and that the consumer does not have to bear the whole cost alone? Reorientation is necessary and must be governed by two objectives: to transform the common agricultural policy into a system of safe food production and to extend such reforms beyond cattle farming and the current crisis by addressing the issue of battery rearing in general, rather than clearing up one mistake to go on to cause another. After beating your breast about the BSE crisis today, Commissioner, do not now go on to promote genetically modified organisms.

 Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission and the European Parliament have a duty to react in the face of the concern of consumers and European farmers over food safety. The BSE crisis is now a public health problem, if not a problem of society. The Commission and the Council are unable to respond satisfactorily, with their hands on their hearts and the precautionary principle on their lips, at the same time confining themselves to an acute mania for meetings and to vague decisions. Countless measures may have been taken at a Community level, but they are either badly implemented or simply inadequate. We must move on to practical proposals and provide the necessary resources to implement them. As a first step, our group is calling for the immediate imposition of systematic testing for BSE throughout the European Union and, at the same time, for the use of MBMs in animal feed to be completely suspended on a temporary basis. Today, Mr Böge, those who are claiming they have no incidence of mad cow disease on their territory are those who are not looking for it. The practices of intensive farming have been the same everywhere. So we must have an exact overview of the situation, country by country. Our group is calling for an immediate ban on MBMs for all livestock as long as Member States are unable to guarantee the implementation of laws preventing BSE and the strict application of European directives. Commissioner, Minister, we must have strict controls in order to guarantee that specified risk materials are separated out throughout the entire animal food chain. The Commission proposal to eliminate animal matter which cannot be consumed by humans from animal feed must also be implemented. MBMs which largely become, even if only temporarily, a new form of waste may be burnt in cement kilns or used to produce biogas. Replacement solutions exist as far as feed for livestock is concerned. MBMs make up but a small percentage of their diet, a fact we often forget. The grass in our meadows, white clover and vetch – currently neglected by the CAP – may provide satisfactory solutions for the safety of animal feed and human food. It is possible to save livestock production by reforming an agricultural economic system which, even today, makes farmers and consumers hostages to multinationals that are more interested in profit than in food safety. Policies must change this situation so that those who are really responsible for this crisis can be penalised and so that precise decisions can make it possible for a first step to be taken towards ending this tragic crisis. This is the thrust of the joint resolution. It is a heavy responsibility, but we were elected to take it on in full. (Applause)

 Mr President, just now you mentioned those opposed to the Tobin tax, particularly G7. Let me remind you that our allies include fervent supporters of this tax. In one of its resolutions, the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, held in Brussels from 9 to 12 October, referred explicitly in recital C and in paragraph 21 to the creation of a Tobin tax. In paragraph 26, moreover, it called for the establishment of an international arbitration organisation to cancel the debts of the countries of the South. Mr President, could the Council not consider ways to help cancel the debt of the countries of the South, given that the ACP countries are asking for a solution similar to the Tobin tax? Would it not be possible to reinitiate discussions on this, given that we have committed ourselves, under the Cotonou agreements, to helping them to find ways to arrange the cancellation of their debt?

Auroi (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is the point of turning a technical report into a potential oenological disaster. The determination to amend the directive on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine may look like a laudable initiative to update a rather technical text, which is 32 years old. Personally, I find the ’68 vintage rather a fine one, but apparently the Commission has decided to modernise. The very first lines of the Klass report clearly stress the value, not just the economic value but also the cultural value, of grape and wine production. Everything, then, could be for the best in the best of all possible European wine-growing worlds. Well, as it turns out, that is not the case. The Commission has taken the opportunity of updating matters to open a Pandora’s box, even though this was something that not one European producer was looking for. While the Commission appears to be overcome with combined GMO and cloning fever, Mrs Klass goes further and goes into convulsions, compounding the GMO issue with all the genotypes she sees all around her. It must be said loud and clear, there was absolutely no need to stuff the articles of this directive with references to directive 90/220, which is currently being revised, unless the intention was to promote genetic manipulation in vines at all costs. And please do not tell me that this was done to anticipate this directive’s being revised or because GM vines do not exist except in laboratory experiments! Commissioner, Mrs Klass, listen to the opinions of the experts from the Institut national des appellations d'origine
, the French National Appellations Institute. The INAO has, on the basis of the information currently available, issued a blanket ban on the use of GMOs in any area whatsoever, which would therefore include, and I quote, genetically modified wine varieties and rootstocks. Would you care to read the Beaune declaration presented by the winegrowers of the Burgundy region? Do you wish to show the industry that Europe is working for better quality and respects the precautionary principle? Commissioner, withdraw the recitals and the articles incorporating GMOs and cloning into this draft. Mrs Klass, take out your amendments and let the relationship between GMOs and genotypes be clarified by the scientists. There is a second problem area, Mrs Klass. You restrict the practice of grafting to herbaceous cuttings alone. In so doing, you protect what goes on in your own region, but rule out the grafting of hardwood cuttings in the winter period, even though this is the grafting technique that is the most widely used in Europe. This amendment should, therefore, be withdrawn. In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, in order to respect the precautionary principle in both spirit and letter, should the articles and amendments which I have just mentioned not be withdrawn, then, as the wine growers themselves demand, we would have to fall in with the opinion of Marianne Isler Béguin, and the Committee on the Environment, and vote against them.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should bear in mind the fact that one of the new features in the White Paper on food safety was the ‘farm to table’ idea, which made farmers directly responsible for the quality and the safety of the animal and vegetable raw materials that they produce. Almost a year after the publication of this paper and following many food crises, many of them linked directly to animal nutrition, Mrs Paulsen’s report is the first investigation of the role of animal nutrition in food safety. This is something we must all welcome. One of the strong points of the proposal is the principle of non-dilution, which prohibits using healthy feedingstuffs to dilute a batch of animal feedingstuffs contaminated by, for example, dioxins. This is the position Mrs Paulsen, from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, has adopted. This was also my position as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture. The amendments proposed by members of the Group of the European People’s Party, Mrs Klass, Mrs Jeggle and Mr Sturdy, have made it possible to reintroduce dilution in the proposal adopted by the Committee on Agriculture. As I personally am not prepared to sacrifice food safety on the altar of the agri-food lobbies, I have withdrawn my name from the report. Try as I might, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot understand the Group of the European People’s Party which, despite the successive crises, involving Belgian chickens contaminated by dioxins, French sewage sludge in animal feed or Dutch sump oils in cooking oil, wishes to continue to poison European consumers to some extent. Their idea is that we should not have to destroy a batch of products just because it is contaminated with dioxins! It would be much better to add healthy products until an acceptable level of pollution is reached. Ladies and gentlemen of the Group of the European People’s Party, now that we have the White Paper, the precautionary principle and the principle of food safety, the only acceptable level of pollution in feedingstuffs for animals that will end up on our plate is the zero level measureable today. This is because dioxins are products that build up in the body. If we were to continue to allow dilution, this dioxin present in animal feedingstuffs would first build up in the animal, and then, to an even greater degree, this toxic product would gradually accumulate throughout the consumer’s body. We must therefore join Mrs Paulsen and the Commission and adopt the principle of non-dilution in order to make animal nutrition safe and to effectively protect European consumers. With regard to inspections, the Commission’s proposal for a directive on inspections in the field of animal nutrition stems from the report by Mr Staes. This reiterates and specifies the factors that are essential if we are to overcome the kind of aberration seen in the dioxin crisis in the summer of 1999. This report seeks to prevent poor coordination between national and European institutions. As draftsman of the opinion, I approve of the main amendments proposed by the Commission, such as the establishment of national contingency operational plans, giving the Commission the option to adopt interim protection measures, the obligation on Member States to inform the Commission as soon as contamination or serious risk thereof is detected, and the creation of a legal basis in this field. It should be emphasised that inspections must take place on three levels in order to enable an emergency system to be established. The first level of inspection is the responsibility of the animal nutrition producing companies themselves as well as the farmers, who ought to be the most directly concerned with ensuring the quality and safety of the products that they use. The second level, of course, involves the Member States, who are responsible for carrying out inspections of food safety. The third level, which is the subject of this amendment, establishes the Commission as the supreme guardian of food safety, authorising it to intervene in emergencies, without necessarily consulting Member States, and to adopt any interim measures necessitated by the emergency. This is all well and good, but Parliament must nevertheless identify its new role in this process. A slot must therefore be provided, at least at the end of the process, for the Commission to inform Parliament of the decisions that it has taken. What will the role of the European food agency provided for in the White Paper be, once it is up and running? We must ensure, on the other hand, that this process does not cause the Member States, businesses or producers to shirk their responsibilities.

This is a controversial report which adds the issue of GMOs to a subject which the Commission did not cover.

We were under the impression that votes on controversial reports were not to be held on Friday mornings.

Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I would like to put this debate into context. As a native of Auvergne, I would remind you that just about a year ago we were debating the Michelin crisis in this Chamber. Michelin announced massive redundancies in its European factories at the same time as record profits on the stock exchange. At that time, in this very House, we were collectively engaged in reviewing European regulations on company mergers. I would suggest to the Commission that it might be worth having another look at Directive 94/EC and Regulation 4064/89 to strengthen information to and consultation of employees before major change – a euphemism for redundancies – whether due to restructuring or merger. A year later, as a first concrete step, we are offered a monitoring centre for industrial change. Fine, but let it really serve the cause of the employees. For that, two conditions seem indispensable. The Commission must be allowed to evaluate the implementation of the directive on collective redundancies and closures of companies, and make proposals so that effective sanctions can be applied in case of non-respect of regulations. The two sides of industry must be associated with this initiative by means budgetary resources allocated by the European institutions.
Auroi (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do not have time to philosophise in just one minute. The important thing, then, is to thank the Commission, and our rapporteur, Mr Staes, for having finally made sense of the White Paper presented by Romano Prodi, which included a chapter on the food chain and animal feedingstuffs. Animals are just the first link in the chain which leads ultimately to human beings. But our impression is that the Council does not see this. The Council does not appear to see that, after the dioxin crisis, every day since the start of the year there have been cases of mad cows just about everywhere in Europe. The Council does not therefore see what we have seen, which is that as a follow-up to European legislation it is necessary to have structures to monitor and take fast action in the event of a problem.  In the context of the forthcoming establishment of the European health authority, it would therefore be advisable to allocate this body real resources in order to enable fast detection and thus prevent contagion. It would also be advisable that all animal feed industry operators should sign proper specifications with the competent health authorities that aim to reduce accidents as much as possible and that accept certain thresholds, making it possible to take any additive raw material or animal feedingstuff components out of circulation, and thus helping to restore consumer confidence.
Auroi (Verts/ALE

 Commissioner, you have just made the very important point that consumers should be able to be confident. They should be able to be confident in all areas and that a whole raft of instruments seems to have been implemented to that end, particularly the White Paper on consumption and food safety. Today, in order to give more meaning to all the current thinking on consumer safety and in order to reconcile Europe with civil society, particularly that society which successfully made its views felt in Seattle and elsewhere, expressing its anxieties about food quality and food safety, could the Commission not take the initiative of organising a forum for a large-scale debate between, on the one hand, the responsible parties from the Commission, the representatives of governments and members of parliament, of course, but also the representatives of civil society, non-governmental organisations, consumers’ organisations, and professionals involved in the sector, in such a way as to ensure that these debates filter down to the European citizen? This would forestall fresh criticism of us as rather a remote body, a forum that does not sufficiently involve the citizen in all debates. Would you be in favour of establishing a forum of this kind?

 I have just a minor question to add to what Mr Daul and Mrs Lienemann have already said. What is to be done? Would it not be sensible also to eliminate the animals taken to the abattoir at the last minute, which are often likely to be infected? Surely it is better to take them out of the food chain?
Auroi (Verts/ALE

 – (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives. Yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected Belgium and other European countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition. You may recall, even though this passed virtually unnoticed by the general public, that the Commission’s scientific experts discovered industrial residues of dioxin-loaded chemical lime in the pulp of citrus fruit imported from Brazil. We must therefore closely examine all the elements of the chain involved in the manufacture of feedingstuffs for production animals. Incidentally, it is ironic that the problem is much less serious for the feedingstuffs of our dogs, cats and other domestic animals. Is it because of cut-throat and globalised competition that industrialists have allowed this sector to become a way of recycling all the waste from the agri-foodstuffs industry? Such a serious issue cannot be limited to a technical debate, even though it is the directive itself which limits the authorisation of antibiotics and other growth promoters. The precautions which we are preparing to take in respect of feedingstuffs must also be applied to the food for the very farm animals which reach our plates. As forcefully underlined by this report, labelling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer on his holding is aware of all the ingredients in the feed which he is giving his livestock. He must also know whether his bag of protein granules includes GMOs as these components could represent a risk to public health. In any case, the precautionary principle requires these products to be clearly traceable at all stages of their marketing. However, before labelling we need clear rules. Straight questions must be asked about the real end-use of animal meal, for example. Although we are looking at all the problems caused by these products in ethical and health terms, it is their use which must be questioned today. In this respect, the chapter of the White Paper on food safety which deals with feedingstuffs must serve as a working basis for going beyond mere commercial questions. The Commission has on many occasions used the farm-to-table example which our colleague in the PPE Group has just underlined. This is a good idea but it must be made to be meaningful and, to do this, the problems linked to animals and those linked to consumer health must be dealt with at the same time.  This is why it is essential to approve Amendment No 2 to Recital 4 which avoids the risks of the monopoly which would arise if companies which were the first to be authorised to place an additive on the market were to remain the only ones able to continue marketing it during the re-evaluation procedure. Also, Amendments Nos 4 and 5 to the new Article 2a must be approved as these will ensure that genetically modified additives are clearly identified as such, thus allowing users to make fully informed decisions.

 Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, with the LEADER report, rural development is very much to the fore. This does not happen all that often and it is gratifying, especially as the LEADER programmes have been key elements in the Union’s rural development policy. It must be pointed out that these programmes have not only been instrumental in structuring regional planning, but have also been vital instruments for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable areas such as, for example, areas experiencing depopulation. It must be stressed that in order to become eligible under the LEADER programme, local operators have combined forces, debated and prepared projects. These programmes have, therefore, been important channels for participative democracy, the rationale of the citizen for Europe. So, the concept for LEADER+ should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes. One urgent question is therefore raised: why, when this programme has been successfully run for ten years, is LEADER+ still classed as experimental? Are there so many other European schemes which can boast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful? For how much longer is the Commission going to leave LEADER at the experimental stage instead of bringing it online as part of the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development?
 Moreover, I wonder at the reduced guidelines to which the Commission wishes to restrict LEADER+. At a time when, Commissioner, after Seattle, we Europeans are fighting on the grounds of multifunctionality in rural development projects, why should we confine ourselves to a few limited criteria with resources that are far from sufficient? As an ecologist, let met tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more diversified and many-sided approaches. In this connection, the Commission is proposing to limit yet further the cooperation actions of local action groups to only candidate countries. A better solution would be, as indeed the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism suggests, strengthened coordination between LEADER+ and the Community cooperation and partnership programmes, such as INTERREG, PHARE, SAPARD or MEDA. The fact is, showing solidarity with Eastern Europe, is all very well, but it is not enough. The tradition which has already been established by the previous programmes with the countries of the south, particularly the countries around the Mediterranean, must not be abandoned. Therefore, once more, we can stress that what the area of agriculture and rural development really needs is codecision. Codecision would give us effective means to progress programmes of this type, which require cooperation and cross-disciplinary application.

 Madam President, Commissioner, a compromise resolution on the usefulness of a tax on international financial flows would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rules. I have two or three points to make in this respect. One of the main demands of the demonstrators in Seattle was, rightly, the establishment of this type of tax, and this is not by chance. The proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich European countries proving that they want to move away from the culture of egoism. Everyone feels that this kind of joint tax is a virtuous measure which does not prevent trade but is aimed primarily at speculation and its perverse effects. The Members on the right should note this. It symbolises the need for solidarity with the countries of the south, particularly those in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific which questioned us extensively on this subject in Seattle. In order to fully achieve its objective, the money supply released by such a tax must be redistributed among the poorest countries. This is how we can give sense and
 morality to the commercial rules and
 show solidarity with the people of the south.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I am not going to reiterate what has already been said. The WTO is a failure in its present form because the WTO is no longer appropriate nor is it transparent. The first lesson we must draw is in fact the one the NGOs were demanding, i.e. there must be fair trade, not free trade, and in this respect, we must realise that nowadays no international organisation can escape the watchful eye of the citizen and that this is to be expected. The next deadline is already quite close. Geneva must not be allowed to go stealthily by. We, of course, have Marrakech, we, of course, have no obligation to achieve results, but we must remain vigilant in order to ensure that separate agreements on agriculture and services do not allow the things we shut the door on to get in by the back door. One of the lessons of Seattle, and Commissioner Lamy started to draw conclusions, is that we must find allies. We do, admittedly, already have a few allies. The most important ones will no doubt be, as Paul Lannoye emphasised, the ACP countries. To take European agriculture as an example, it cannot go on saying that it is doing fine, that it is multifunctional, that it is operating in a positive way, that it will henceforth protect its consumers, while at the same time maintaining a selfish attitude with regard to the countries of the south. In order to be heard, we must find the resources to enable these poorest countries to also have quality food, and quality products. The whole world today has the right to show solidarity and to have the resources to live better, to get out of this state of international self-centredness.

 Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance abstained on the report, which it considered rather wet. As far as we were concerned, the objective of this report was to give Commissioner Lamy a specific negotiating mandate for the Round due to open in Seattle. Well, such a specific mandate has not been adequately asserted. That being the case, we would have liked Parliament to propose a very political specification to the Commission, instead of drawing up a more diplomatic report which deplores, stresses and considers but does not give any sort of mandate. The tone of the report is still too liberal, then, for us to find any reflection of our own views, especially since none of our amendments is included in it. The report, thus amended, has significant weaknesses regarding TRIPS. We can find nothing acceptable to us in it on the subject of intellectual property rights relating to trade. As regards the MAI, which was rejected by the OECD and which is coming back again, a reinforced code of conduct must be drawn up for investment and strict regulations must be drawn up in this field, and this is equally applicable to the settlement of disputes. The report does, however, include some fundamental principles which we consider essential such as the precautionary principle, regulations on production methods and procedures. It stresses in particular the labelling of foodstuffs in order to ensure the implementation of food safety, and the necessity of adopting a stance that is more favourable to developing countries. At any event, we shall follow with great interest the way in which the Commission conducts the negotiations, and even though we still find this amended report too liberal in tone, you will find that we Greens will defend this text most fiercely if Commissioner Lamy should step below the recommendations made here.

 To bring this debate to a close, Commissioner, I think that it would be useful to let the matter lie. For much of the debate, I have had the impression that a kind of war was being fought to see whether it would be Great Britain or France who would lose face. I think that that is not what the issue – or the debate – is about, but it does affect the following question in a major way: what is being proposed for European consumers as a whole? British consumers, just like French and Spanish consumers, have the right to know what they are eating and from this point of view, I consider labelling and traceability to be both unavoidable and essential.  But, Commissioner, should it not be pointed out that the source of the whole business, geographically speaking, is Great Britain. Excuse me for saying so, but that is where the first cases of BSE occurred. And why was that? Because there is a farming system there that is particularly geared towards high productivity, because there more than anywhere else, farmers are sacrificed at the altar of the food-processing industry and because instead of crying over British farmers, we would do better to help them to achieve sound means of production, more appropriate means of production. This is something they have already begun to do. I would not want to forget to mention the fact that at the worst moments of this mad cow crisis, the Welsh and the Scots, who have continued to maintain more traditional farming methods, have been punished in the same way as English producers. Therefore, Commissioner, please tell me what financial resources will be released to pay for traceability, for the slaughter of whole herds in which there is a single case of BSE, for cases of cattle plague, because that is the only way we will be able to reassure consumers. I also think that from this point of view, every European country needs to stop repeating the words “precautionary principle”, as we have done for years, whilst continuing to practise the same frenzied methods of high productivity, and to highlight two or three rather limited examples in order to exercise their rights. Well, Commissioner, what resources will this agency be given?

 Mr President, I spoke yesterday. I wish to remind you that I am the representative for the town where Michelin has its headquarters, since we do not dare mention its name today, although Commissioner Diamantopoulou did have the courage to do so yesterday. I believe that the union leaders from Michelin who were among us yesterday will be able to assess the manner in which the majority of this House is treating them at its face value.
Auroi (Greens/ALE

 Commissioner, Mr President, the Commissioner’s statement was more concerned with SMEs than with the concerns of the Michelin employees represented here. I was born in Clermont Ferrand and live there still, Michelin’s birthplace and headquarters, and it is for this reason, amongst others, that they have been my guests here on several occasions. The concomitant announcements of the axing of 7,500 jobs, the enormous increase in its profits, and the closure of the Wolbert-Michelin factory at Soissons, described as a PR mistake by the company’s directors, show to what extent cynicism and lack of respect are the driving forces behind this multinational’s industrial strategy.  Other identical examples are still fresh in our memory, Renault Vilvorde, the French banking system and the large distribution companies, and let us not forget Daewoo. All these companies who implement redundancy plans year after year have benefited from European and national subsidies without at any time being held accountable for the way in which they use those funds.  I think that our institution is duty-bound to be involved with the concerns of millions of Europeans who live in unemployment or in the fear of becoming unemployed. We must therefore be firm and clear on three points. We must work out whether the allocation of sums to large companies will result, above all else, in guaranteeing the permanence of jobs. On the eve of the opening of the WTO negotiations, we must remind everyone that any business strategy, including that of multinationals, must take the human figures into account, in the same way as the economic and financial figures, so that millions of European employees may keep their jobs and their dignity.  Finally, at a time when a European-wide Michelin works committee has just come into being, Community legislation must be amended so that employees, or their representatives, who are concerned at the plans for collective redundancy on economic grounds can take their case to the competent local court, without waiting for the redundancy to be announced, and challenge the grounds for the decision.  This is the thinking behind the resolution that we are proposing and it is only if these conditions are met that Europe will maintain its political role whilst facilitating the truly sustainable economic development of businesses and protecting the rights of employees who are, let us never forget, the Union’s lifeblood.

 Madam President, President Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, after hearing Mr Prodi’s proposals, I am utterly astounded by the position of the PPE and the PSE on food safety. Perhaps they do not feel capable of putting forward concrete proposals today, but we do. That is why we wished to propose a resolution for, throughout Europe, the series of scandals which have occurred means that, today, the citizens and consumers no longer have any confidence in their farmers. The quibbling involved in stating that the Committee on the Environment has scheduled a hearing on animal feedingstuffs should not be an obstacle to the debate. Of course, one can listen to the experts on a small part of the subject, but the fact remains that we, as Members of Parliament, must take initiatives. It seems to me that what the citizens expect of Parliament and the Commission are initiatives. Adopting a resolution today would have been a clear sign on this subject. From the recent past and its frenzied emphasis on high productivity, we have inherited a situation which, in the agricultural sector just as – too often – elsewhere, has subordinated policy to the major food-processing groups and major distributors resulting in mad cows, dioxin-contaminated chickens, motor oil in cooking oil, sewage sludge in cattle meal, and who knows what else? There is a long list of scandals which show that, as regards agricultural production, European States have been no more virtuous than their American counterparts, even if they have banned hormones. We should have the courage to say so. The recent attempts by some governments to control these industries are still insufficient. What is more, a good number of European States have not taken any action. In order to achieve this, we need regulations which prioritise the precautionary principle which the Greens have long cherished. In addition, we must agree on the meaning of this principle. For us it means getting back to the quality of foodstuffs which guarantees the safety of products intended for consumption. We are first of all asking for a list of all the toxic substances which can contaminate our food through pollution, be it of air, water, or soil. We are asking for regular tests in branches of industry where there have been problems with toxicity, and inspections in agricultural areas located in the vicinity of firms creating pollution. We are asking for traceability at all levels, not just in the labelling of the products that go into the housewife’s shopping basket, but also beforehand. We want to ascertain the exact content of products which go into cattle feed. Finally, according to this same principle, it is vital to wait for a period before accepting genetically-modified products whose long-term effects on the resistance of plants unsuitable for cultivation are unknown, as little known as the adaptability of weeds to GMOs. If the European Union really wishes to show all those who have suffered from past neglect that it wished to draw all the parties involved together and that they can once again have confidence in its policies, it must immediately put forward some very concrete proposals on food safety.

 Mr President, following the UN report on the situation in the Congo and the US Government report on global warming, a report commissioned by the World Bank itself has now confirmed the fears that the Greens have been expressing for some time. What has happened is that the World Bank set up a study on the extraction industries, which, after two years of consultation with public bodies, governments and business, has produced a report which is damning with regard to its development policy. The report highlights the deficiencies and counter-productive effects of the World Bank’s policy in countries rich in natural resources. In the words of the study itself, the World Bank has attracted too many investors, without taking any real interest in helping the countries to develop their abilities to convert their natural riches into means of combating poverty. Similarly, the Commission has emphasised the lack of action on the part of the World Bank in terms of environmental and social supervision. In this respect, the study states that, if the full force of the market is unleashed without any robust frameworks, the resultant damage may be extremely serious. There are numerous examples of loathsome financing. The Yanacocha gold mine in Peru is the prototype toxic tragedy. Managed by an American company, the mine has flattened five mountains, displaced thousands of people and polluted with cyanide the water throughout the entire region. The World Bank has also given its support to the Chad-Cameroon pipeline, which we were alone in combating, and which has had disastrous social and environmental consequences: massive migration, an increase in the unreliability of food supplies and an increase in prostitution, with a consequent increased prevalence of AIDS. Can we really speak of a development policy? The exploitation of oil, gas or mines is not necessarily the same thing as poverty reduction. In countries still subject to a high degree of corruption, where the legal frameworks are still unreliable and democracy is uncertain, the World Bank unfortunately is doing nothing to encourage sustainable development. On the contrary, in numerous countries, the extraction industries have been associated with violations of human rights and civil conflicts, as has been seen in Burma. Even worse, more than 80% of the World Bank’s oil financing is actually going to the North and not to poor countries. The consequence of this blind and generous investment: countries with disappointing results outnumber the countries making substantial progress. The Greens, in line with the study’s recommendations, are advocating a moratorium on the financing of oil projects until 2008, the cessation of financing for coalmines in order to combat greenhouse gases, the encouragement of clean and renewable energy along with energy efficiency. The European Union has a major role to play here in demanding, through the Member States, that the World Bank should take account of the study’s recommendations. The World Bank has been on the wrong track for too long and it is time for it to change course so that development policy can at last benefit those most in need.  (Applause)

Mr President, Mr Scarbonchi’s report poses a series of good questions. For several years, we, the Greens, have been fighting for parliamentary control and transparency, the guarantees of democracy. It is normal that the allocation and use of credits should be controlled by a body that is representative and democratic – characteristics that the EDF has not, it is true to say, manifested up to now. Inclusion in the budget is one of the ways in which control of this programme may be guaranteed. It gives rise, however, to new problems. How to prevent the risk of transferring one budget heading to another, if there is no provision for some sort of ring-fencing? How to combine the Parliament’s annual budgetary compartmentalisation with the EDF’s five-year budget? The report does not provide enough solutions; it is a pity, since the flaws will affect the quality of control. Furthermore, mention cannot be made of the EDF without referring to other risks of misinterpretation. How do we prevent this programme, controlled exclusively by European institutions, from favouring, for example, European enterprises in the ACP countries? How do we prevent the development of large projects favouring powerful states being preferred to the initiatives of less influential states or micro-projects closer to the needs of the population? Worse still, how are we to ensure that it will not be used as a roundabout means of financing armies on the pretext of keeping the peace? All this would divert the EDF from its purpose, which is development. Quite to the contrary, it would make more sense to use the EDF for actions aimed at improving public health or environmental protection policies, for example. To work for development, in fact, it would be more logical to delegate control to the joint ACP/EU Parliamentary Assembly. This would give us a real advance, guaranteeing real democratic control. In fact, who is better placed to rule on the allocation and use of credits than the joint Parliamentary Assembly, in terms of both political legitimacy and capability? It still needs to be given the means and the responsibilities. All those Members who have spoken have said how dear democratic principles are to them. It is for the sake of their defence and their effectiveness that we cannot content ourselves with simple control by Parliament. We shall, however, support this report as the symbol of a first step, one that is decisive, but doubtless insufficient.

Mr President, the Commission's proposal emphasises the introduction of two new types of packaging in contact with food: what is known as 'active' packaging, which releases preservatives into the food, and what is known as 'intelligent' packaging, which warns consumers when the food has gone off or has some undesirable characteristic. Even though the rapporteur has attempted to improve the labelling rules, the decision-making procedures, including the procedure for authorisation by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and access to public documents, the report, as it stands, is still unacceptable to the Greens. Whereas Community legislation on food additives is regulated in great detail, the Commission's proposal simply introduces a general procedural framework, putting great emphasis on comitology. The door is left wide open for the introduction of active packaging, without providing a strict framework for specific substances. We have been fighting for a very long time against the ever-increasing exposure of consumers to a whole host of additives and we refuse to let these become more widespread, which would be damaging to health. The Greens therefore request that authorisation should be withheld from active packaging whose effects are not known, that it should be ensured that there are no toxic products in active packaging, and that Community legislation on food additives should be applied strictly if new food packaging is authorised. If our proposals are rejected, we will be obliged to vote against this report, which does not adequately consider the possible consequences for consumer health. How long will it be before we see urgent recalls of certain future types of packaging?

Mr President, doctors since the time of Hippocrates have known that our health is dependent on our environment. Media coverage in recent years has only confirmed people's concerns. Today's epidemiological landscape has changed dramatically. It is dominated by cardiovascular diseases, cancers, allergic conditions and respiratory diseases. These diseases have many causes, which are often complex and interact with one another. These causes are often uncertain and some are not yet known. It is recognised, however, that the environment, in the widest sense of the term, plays a leading role. Our physical environment is thus one of the major risk factors for the health of our citizens. I will not dwell now on the dangers presented by polluted industrial sites or nuclear power plants. Above all, we must from now on take more account of the immediate environment that causes thousands of cases of cancer. Chemicals, electromagnetic waves or urban and atmospheric traffic pollution: these are the major challenges for public health in Europe. Our behaviour and our way of life encourage an excessively rich diet, and stress and the intensification of work give rise to many health problems. For example, we must take a strong stand against smoking, in particular passive smoking and smoking around children. We must now put in place strong regulations allowing smoking to be banned in the workplace and in public places. In the face of these challenges, we are concerned by the weakness of the Commission's proposals. The Greens call for a still more specific and more ambitious strategy, which will be able to rise to the health challenges of the twenty-first century. This, may I add, is the direction taken by the amendments we have tabled. We must tackle the problems at their source by putting forward specific actions right now, while accepting the inherent uncertainties of scientific knowledge. The strategy must therefore be firmly based on the precautionary principle and the principle of prevention. In this context, we are calling for a significant strengthening of the strategy of reducing exposure to risks. The Greens ask for these various major lines of thinking and action to be taken into account, so that the European Union is able to deal with the fears and expectations of our fellow citizens and, above all, with the revolution in public health that we must carry out.

 Madam President, the battle against AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis has for a long time been one of the principal concerns of the Greens. Moreover we welcome the consensus that now prevails regarding this report, which would not have been possible four years ago. It is disquieting to learn that deaths are still being counted in millions, particularly if one takes into account the fact that these diseases affect many children or pregnant women. It is sad and devastating to learn that these diseases are still killing even though treatments exist. The accessibility of medicines must be guaranteed. It is necessary to facilitate not only a mere reduction in prices, but also the assignment of patents, because that is necessary in order to enable developing countries to produce these products for their people, or import them at low prices. The efforts on which we agree must be targeted first and foremost at children and pregnant women. Real assistance must be provided for women, who carry within them the future of the continent. This assistance includes, in addition to treatments, information about these infections, and in that respect it is necessary to strengthen the health structures in these countries. The adoption of this report will confirm the European Union’s involvement in the struggle for the health of Africa.

 Madam President, will NEPAD be the tool of African renaissance when other plans have failed? The Greens are perhaps the only ones who doubt it. Of course we support the human-rights aspect of NEPAD, though we regret the fact that it is often merely theoretical. We shall not linger here on the contempt, on the part of the authors of NEPAD, for any prior consultation of the people regarding the drawing up of the plan, and we would point out that repression of political opponents and journalists is still happening in Africa, even in Senegal. In economic terms, NEPAD promises the same liberalism as was created by the World Bank and the IMF, the liberalism of structural adjustment plans, the same liberalism which brought Argentina to its knees and which grapples with public services, health services, water-distribution services and education services, the liberalism which, in the final analysis, increases inequalities and poverty, in particular as they affect women. It is time to carry out an evaluation of the impact of earlier commercial liberalisation policies on social and economic development and on the protection of the environment. NEPAD is not short of freedoms, be it freedom of capital, free movement of goods or freedom to provide services. Yet what has happened to the free movement of workers within the Community of African States? What has happened to the freedom of peoples to choose their own future? Moreover, I should like to draw your attention to the gradual regionalisation for which NEPAD makes provision. There is a problem in that the European Union supports such zones, which are now tending to resemble scenarios in which the NEPAD instigating countries take neighbouring African countries under their political and economic wing. Nor will NEPAD be able to claim to be a viable solution while at the same time ignoring what is at stake as a result of the terrible burden of debt borne by the countries of Africa. Thus provision is made for reducing the debt only in the case of countries which have followed neo-liberal principles. The European Union should seek and apply the total and unconditional cancellation of the debt. Promoting sustainable development in Africa does not mean throwing that continent to the mercy of the multinationals and of foreign investments. It does not mean encouraging the exploitation of its resources by foreign powers. For example, the agricultural and mining sectors to which NEPAD gives priority will be totally dependent on prices that are fixed by the countries of the North. Africa is not for sale. Africa must be constructed by and for Africans.

 Mr President, the situation in Côte d'Ivoire continues to deteriorate. We have condemned the concept of ‘ivoirity’, which has tainted the electoral legitimacy of Laurent Gbagbo, but we have also condemned the military rebellion, which is unacceptable in a democracy. We were sceptical about the signing of the Marcoussis peace agreement, which showed every sign of having been dictated by the former colonial power. As might have been expected, it was not viable and led to the resignation, in September, of the rebel ministers in the government of national reconciliation. Although progress has been made in recent months, new confrontations over the last fortnight have weakened the chances of relaunching the peace process. Now, the violence in the north, as well as in the cocoa belt, and the abuses by the so-called patriotic forces are leading to ever-increasing human rights violations. We request that these cease without delay and that the government and the rebel forces stop exploiting demonstrations which, in reality, are not at all spontaneous. We demand that investigation procedures be put in place to punish those responsible for the abuses. We condemn just as vigorously the assassination of the French journalist Jean Hélène, and we ask that an international inquiry be set up in order to bring those responsible to justice. We call for genuine negotiations to be resumed with a view to bringing the conflict to an end. It is only by taking account of all the political forces in the country and of the balance between these forces that it will be possible to find a peaceful and democratic solution, leading to the relaunch of a peace process that must include the disarmament of the militias, together with free legislative and presidential general elections under international supervision. If this is to be achieved, the European Union’s policy of prevention must tackle the structural causes, that is to say poverty, the unequal distribution of wealth, social injustice, the oppression of minorities and the disorganisation of the state. Alongside this, the EU must adopt a coherent trade and development policy in order to guarantee aid to the African economies and, in particular, to the African population. In this context, we call upon the Commission not to extend the fisheries agreement with Côte d'Ivoire for as long as implementation of development cooperation within the framework of the Cotonou agreements remains suspended. To conclude, we would signal our commitment to respect for minorities, which is an indispensable basis for the peaceful settlement of these conflicts in Africa.

 Mr President, for the Greens, decentralised cooperation is an essential element of cooperation and development policy. In fact, it is one of the only constituents of that policy which guarantees the real use of funds by the nations of the South. Mr Zimmerling’s report is a step in the right direction, in that he has created a real instrument which guarantees the participation of citizens in developing countries. The Howitt report had already opened up some interesting lines of action, and this new report improves even further the collaboration with non-governmental organisations. We welcome the development of the list of potential partners. It is particularly important to us that account should be taken of the organisations of the indigenous populations. They are in many cases minorities and suffer opposition from the public authorities, which more often than not represent authoritarian powers. As far as those who are actually involved are concerned, however, the question of the churches gives rise to problems. Although it seems obvious to everyone that charitable organisations, including those of a religious nature, can benefit from funds for decentralised cooperation, on the other hand it seems inconceivable to me that the European Union should, under this heading, be funding the churches themselves, since by definition their aim is proselytisation. Are we going to finance Catholic churches or Protestant chapels in Moslem countries, or the building of mosques in Christian countries? We discussed this with the rapporteur, who seemed to have understood the problem that was raised. The fact that this viewpoint was retained before the vote in committee may have looked like an oversight. Now, however, when the Committee on Development and Cooperation has rejected this word, and by a large majority, its re-insertion through the intervention of the Council Presidency, which has used a version of the Treaty of Amsterdam – minus its philosophical elements – leaves me somewhat puzzled as to the final objective of this text. In the absence of any clarification on this point, we shall not be able to vote in favour of this report. I would therefore strongly urge my fellow Members to return to the amendment adopted at the committee stage, whereby the list was restricted to charitable organisations. It is vital that as many representatives of civil society as possible can make their opinions known, and can have recourse to funding which is independent of their state authorities, so as to strengthen the independence of social movements which are campaigning for sustainable development, for human rights and for social rights, for democratisation or for cultural pluralism. This is why we are asking that the overall funding should be increased from EUR 18 million to EUR 36 million. This appears to us to be vitally important if all those involved are to take part in the debate. In other words, it is not enough to create a good policy: it is even more important to provide it with adequate financial resources.

 Mr President, we have been working successfully on this project to revise European legislation on medicinal products for two years. It is true that, at that time, I had hoped for a lot more than this compromise package, negotiated with the Council and the Commission, which will be put to the vote tomorrow. For me, this process of revision of the procedures for European marketing authorisation of human and veterinary medicinal products should lead to a radical development of the criteria for evaluating and authorising medicinal products in the interests of patients, public health and health-care professionals. The principal aim of this revision was to have the European Agency legally recognise all of the new substances. In actual fact, the centralised procedure will only focus on some illnesses. The London Agency has sufficiently enlarged its sphere of activity to ensure its funding, but the national authorities have, for their part, retained the most lucrative classes of medicinal products, namely those regarding neurodegenerative disorders or cardiovascular diseases. The interests of the Commission and the Council are safe, but are they those of the patients? Over and above introducing Braille, we have improved pharmacovigilance and transparency in patients’ interests, but it is true that some last-minute Council compromises subtly weakened these gains. The majority of the documents relating to the evaluation of medicinal products should be publicly accessible, but what about pharmacovigilance reports? The public authorities responsible for issuing authorisations should be independent of companies but remain, in actual fact, dependent upon private taxation. Patients do not have the means to directly inform the competent authorities of the side effects of medicinal products, and doctors are not obliged to do so. It is a great victory, however, that advertising for medicinal products subject to prescription was rejected, but until when? In terms of public health, the environmental impact of the new medicinal products should be assessed. This should not be the sole evaluation criteria, but it must be considered in the benefit-risk equation for a medicinal product and, therefore, be one of the conditions for granting a marketing authorisation. The environmental risk goes far beyond the damage to nature; pollution linked to discharges of toxic residue from medicinal products represents a risk to human health. Clearly, treatments for which the medical benefits outweigh the environmental risks should continue to be used. When effective alternatives exist, however, they should be promoted. I am sorry to say that the final wording of the amendments concerned does not recognise the full scale of the problem. For a doctor such as myself, the evaluation of the effectiveness of medicinal products compared to others is sorely lacking in this new pharmaceutical package. It is only the safety and the quality of the new substances 
that 
count. It is of little importance whether or not they provide a significant clinical benefit. I endeavoured to make the concept of added therapeutic value acceptable in order to encourage firms to carry out research into substances that are genuinely innovative, and I came up against the opposition of all of the institutions. I was, however, persuaded that this debate will return to this House, because the pharmaceutical industry no longer wants to make do with placing new bogus treatments on the market and overprotecting them for years. It is true that the major cause of friction related to the authorisation of generic medicinal products. The pharmaceutical industry is trying to delay the sale of generic products, and this is normal. The Commission and some Members shared this reaction, however, by restricting the definition of generic products, tightening the conditions for granting authorisations and extending the periods for authorisation by using various tricks: switch, new indications etc. Despite opposition from the majority of Member States faced with problems of funding their social security, the first European medicinal products will have the longest protection period of administrative data in the world. I wonder, furthermore, about the compatibility of such protection with the Doha provisions that call for the creation of generic medicines for export. That is certainly the main concern raised by this legislation when it comes to funding public health. Finally, another major disappointment was in the area of homeopathic medicinal products. In actual fact and in conclusion, I recognise that we have made much progress, and I welcome this, but it is true that there still remains a great deal to do in the years to come.

 Mr President, the conflict between the Sri Lankan Government and the Tamil Tigers has been going on for thirty years and has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths. The negotiations having been suspended in April, the resumption of dialogue at the end of October with the Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, was a significant step forward on the road to peace. Institutionally speaking, substantial progress had been made towards the resolution of the conflict. The legal coup d’état
, however, by the President, Chandrika Kumaratunga, which interrupted the negotiations, was a giant leap backwards. The proclamation of a state of emergency, the concentration of the most important State posts – Ministers for the Interior, Defence and Information – in the hands of the President, the intervention of the army and the suspension of parliamentary activities all show that the situation is getting worse. It could deteriorate rapidly and even result in a resumption of the war and new elections with uncertain results. The President’s accusations against the government and the uncertainty surrounding the ceasefire are very worrying. We support the efforts of the Prime Minister to engage in dialogue. The President must resume contacts with the Prime Minister as soon as possible in order to find a constitutional solution. At the same time, the cooperation must be extended to include all the political leaders and all interest groups. Whatever happens, the immediate end to the state of emergency is essential if the peace process is to be resumed immediately. In this respect, we fully support the Norwegian Government in its role as mediator and hope that it resumes its efforts as soon as possible. The situation is particularly worrying in relation to the issue of human rights. The emergency regime must not lead to an increase in infringements of fundamental freedoms. We are especially concerned about the risk of a fresh upsurge of police and military interventions and, above all, the risk of torture or inhumane treatment. In conclusion, we hope that the state of emergency does not slow down the distribution of the aid pledged at the Donor Conference in May. It is because we know that the peace process cannot move forward until internal relations are eased that we are calling for an end to the emergency regime as soon as possible.

 Mr President, the conflict in the province of Atjeh (Aceh) has been going on for 27 years and has already resulted in thousands of deaths. The situation deteriorated even further after the breakdown in May of the fragile Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, the establishment of a state of emergency by the Indonesian Government and the closure of the province. The imposition of martial law led this House to adopt, in June, an initial resolution, in which we denounced the lack of freedom for the people and of freedom of the press. We expressed our concern regarding the fresh upsurge of violence, the daily murders and the increase in the number of arrests and disappearances. This condemnation was not sufficient, as martial law has just been extended for six months. We regard this decision as unacceptable. Our main concern, however, relates to the closing-off of the region and the fact that it is impossible to gain access to the people, and particularly the victims of the conflict, because when there is a state of emergency the military governs the region and distributes the humanitarian aid. We call on the Indonesian Government to respect international military law and to allow humanitarian organisations access to the area so that they can provide assistance to the refugees, displaced persons and prisoners. We are also concerned about the radicalisation of the conflict and the marginalisation of civil society campaigners at a time when moderate critical voices are needed to move towards peace and reconstruction. With the hope of re-establishing dialogue, on behalf of the human rights group of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I organised, in October, a discussion on the critical situation in Atjeh and Papua. Unfortunately, the Indonesian Government’s failure to face the separatist movements and civil society representatives prevented us from making any progress in achieving a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Sadly, it is all too clear that the fall of the Suharto dictatorship and the return to democracy in Indonesia have not been accompanied by a significant improvement in human rights. In reality, the army is still in power. Civil liberties, trade union freedom and the freedom of expression continue to be scorned. The tragedy in East Timor does not appear to have served as an example for the Government in view of the demands for autonomy that are coming from Borneo, the Moluccas, Atjeh and Papua. There is no doubt that the rise in fundamentalism and in the number of terrorist attacks that are in the headlines of the international press are of grave concern, but it is in the name of national unity and the fight against terrorism where, far from the view of the media, freedoms are treated with contempt every day and a savage repression rages, not only in Atjeh but also in Papua. Even though we do not support the armed rebellions, we call on the Indonesian Government to engage in dialogue with the fighters in order to build peace, and we call on the European Union to promote the reconciliation process.

Mr President, if there is one certainty about cancer it is that early diagnosis increases the chances of cure. Screening is therefore vital, in particular for people exposed to mutagenic or carcinogenic substances. Equality of access to screening programmes also needs to be guaranteed for all. To this end, awareness campaigns, which seek to inform the public, are imperative. The Mussa report recalls these basic principles, and we will definitely vote in favour of this text. The report also proposes to create cancer registers to target, in the first instance, population groups that show a high incidence due to environmental factors or those linked to dietary habits. This route is fundamental, because we need to go further. Screening, which is certainly essential, is in fact only a secondary prevention measure. We need to act beforehand, to assess the influence of factors such as nutrition, environment, and life style, and to try to reduce their importance. That is real prevention: eliminating the causes or the circumstance propitious to the disease rather than trying too late to cure them. I am extremely concerned by the latest statistics that show that lung cancer linked to smoking has spread, in particular in women, and also cancers of the breast, uterus or prostate, that are directly linked to the influence of hormones. We need to bring to the fore the determining factors in the development of these cancers: endocrinal disturbances, dietary hormones or others. In the same way, the increase in prostate cancer in certain groups of farmers is directly linked to the use of pesticides. In addition, it has been proven that pollution, electro magnetic waves or other chemical factors increase the risk of some cancers. Just remember the problem linked to asbestos and the 70 years it took to manage to ban it; only now are our hospitals seeing the full consequences of it. We need to tackle these problems at the roots and extend public health policies to other areas if we really want to fight cancer in Europe.

 Mr President, the revision of this regulation has given us plenty to think about. First of all, we had the proposed cooperation agreement which, it has to be said, looked more like a free-trade agreement than a development programme. That did not surprise us unduly, because it formed part of the current European policy which is leading to a change in the thinking behind the Community’s development policy. Within that regulation, however, we succeeded in reinserting sustainable development, accompanied by social and environmental objectives. In particular, 10% of the budget for this programme is to be allocated to the conservation and sustainable management of natural resources, and 35% to social and health infrastructures. Human rights, and especially women’s rights, the rights of minorities and of indigenous peoples and the removal of inequalities are also the guiding principles of European cooperation policy in these regions. Finally, we have ensured that civil society will participate in the definition of the multi-annual development plans. Reducing poverty will therefore have to be the first goal of the national programmes which will be negotiated between each country and the Commission. Since Parliament will not be consulted, it was necessary to insert some guidelines at an early stage, and that is what we did in the Committee on Development and Cooperation. I beg you, ladies and gentlemen, not to call into question, for institutional reasons, a text which has finally been given a political content. Why ask for two regulations, one for Asia and the other for Latin America, rather than a single regulation divided into several chapters? We would do better to campaign for an overall increase in aid rather than wanting to know which continent will get most. As far as I am concerned, it is irrelevant whether the money is allocated to Asia or to Latin America, provided that it goes to the poorest people. It is for that reason that we want to have parliamentary control. Unfortunately we have used up a great deal of energy and wasted a great deal of time on a dispute which seems to me to be trivial, given the size of the challenges we have to meet in Asia and in Latin America. I believe that the essential thing is to fight for the content of these regulations, the content of these chapters, the content that we are giving them today, because that is what the people of both Asia and Latin America expect of us today.

 Mr President, we are satisfied, on the whole, with Mr Whitehead’s report and with the fact that the Council has generally taken on board our amendments. The clarification of the detailed rules for financing consumer protection organisations was essential. The definition of such bodies must be strict. The report follows this line, while at the same time guaranteeing the participation of a panel of organisations. Of course we must keep those organisations which demonstrate the necessary technical competence, but we must also ensure the independence of representative bodies. It is absolutely essential to avoid a situation in which pressure groups – whether industrial, commercial, professional or any other kind – see those bodies as a means of indirectly influencing the Union’s policy. On the other hand, we must maintain our relations with the cooperatives, which take consumers’ interests into account in their charters. Relations with consumer protection organisations have to be developed in close contact with the public. We cannot, therefore, be satisfied with giving preferential treatment to relations with Community or national organisations while merely offering support to regional bodies: the latter must enjoy proper representation within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, as well as corresponding financial aid. That committee will also be responsible for ensuring even greater representation of civil society. The expansion in the sphere of competence is important. The bodies in the food sector have now been joined by consumer protection organisations in the services sector and, more broadly, in the non-food sectors. Access to information is an essential guarantee of consumer protection. This is why we asked for, and obtained, public data banks that would be easily accessible. The public must be able to find out about the precise history of products, their origin, their method of production etc. This means, amongst other things, improving labelling – an effective means of guaranteeing that consumers are informed. We must go further, however. If we want to be sure that safe products are being marketed, we not only need to be informed about the risks: we also need to see about reducing those risks. That is only possible if we develop comparative evaluations with a view to sustainable and responsible production and consumption. That is the real consumer protection policy.

 Mr President, we have just heard Mr Lannoye and Mrs Morgantini present their excellent reports, which we totally support. This also gives us an opportunity to adopt the reports before the WTO Ministerial Conference opens in Cancún, and I hope that Commissioner Lamy, who will be representing the EU next week, will oblige us by taking the reports into account as part of his negotiating mandate, especially as regards the key issue of preventing water privatisation. I am sure my friend Mr Lannoye will not hold it against me if I say I attach particular importance to Mrs Morgantini's report. The Commission wants to help the developing countries to take advantage of trade. The question is, will the WTO's rules allow them to do that? I am not sure, given the disagreements that currently divide the developing countries and the western countries over the Singapore Issues, for example, that the European Union is best placed to support the position of the countries of the South, as it has its own interests to defend, the most striking examples being agriculture and fisheries. Helping the developing countries to take advantage of trade first and foremost means changing the rules governing trade to make them more favourable to developing countries. The countries of the South were first encouraged to export commodities with low added value, only to have restrictions imposed on them, and they are now reeling from the impact of the fall in commodity prices and the problems in accessing markets in the countries of the North. As for the WTO, it does not so much regulate markets as liberalise trade. For example, the common market organisations for coffee and cotton and the price stabilisation systems for raw materials have at present simply disappeared. What is more, does helping countries really mean helping their populations? Do the hypothetical benefits of trade really go to the poorest people, or do they get no further than the top of the ladder in these countries? Promoting fair trade is still the only viable long-term strategy. On the one hand, we have to pay the producers in the countries of the South a fair price for their commodities; on the other hand, there is an urgent need to open up our markets to imports from developing countries and to abandon subsidies to our farmers. To that extent, the Cancún conference gives some room for optimism. I hope they will not be disappointed. It is only by changing and diversifying their production that the developing countries will really be able to establish their independence and play a key role in world trade. The Commission's efforts should be directed towards achieving that objective, and this is the issue that the Cancún conference should focus its work on. Helping developing countries to develop their trade above all means helping the populations of those countries to try to live a better life. Can trade be a means of ensuring a better life? I do not doubt that it can, but it is certainly not the only way.

 Mr President, up to now we have placed particular emphasis on the fight against communicable diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. We have repeatedly asked for the scope of this action to be extended to other diseases particularly associated with poverty and with poor hygiene and environmental conditions. I therefore very warmly welcome John Bowis's report, which approaches health in the broadest possible way and takes account of the impact on health of food, environmental and educational policy. Preventing diseases involves improving the living conditions of people in the South, by means of a coherent and integrated development strategy. In the long term a preventive strategy is essential. In the shorter term, we need to ensure that the sick have access to treatment and medicines, which also have to be made available in the first place. It is true that in the majority of countries in the South health systems are poor, but privatising the sector will not solve the problem. Only the public sector can provide free and universal health care. For that reason, health should continue to be excluded from GATS, and I am delighted that this report reiterates that fundamental principle. I of course support the amendment calling for the provisions of the Doha Declaration on medicines to be implemented, especially as the agreement that the TRIPS Council has just reached is supposed to allow it to come into force. Although we welcome this entry into force, it also has to be recognised that the complexity of this agreement means that we have some doubts about its effectiveness. For example, countries without any production capacity will be subject to a double system of mandatory licences and restrictions that they could often find costly. If health really is one of the priorities of the European Union's development policy, then the Member States should make a firm commitment to grant the mandatory licences developing countries need if they are to protect their public health. We Members of the European Parliament need to join together to exert continuing pressure if this communication is not to be just a dead letter.

 Mr President, Mr Howitt's report opens up some interesting avenues. Public involvement in cooperation with developing countries is at the heart of our concerns. This communication should underpin real cooperation with non-state actors. Who are these non-state actors though? Who are these privileged partners? Are they partners imposed on us? We believe that participation should involve a wide range of actors, including partners from the South, and it should prevent the poorest countries from being marginalised. This means that a proper mechanism needs to be established to optimise participants' representation. This communication should not allow the Commission and the governments of developing countries to legitimise their actions by treating non-state actors as pawns. The populations of the countries of the South themselves should be able to democratically appoint their representatives and organise themselves collectively through associations, trade unions and grassroots organisations. It is this process that we need to support by providing the structural aid needed to guarantee that non-state actors have the independence that is vital for dialogue and for the involvement of all strata in society. It is incumbent on European companies to stop banning trade union organisation and rights of association for workers and local people. On the contrary, they should encourage such activities. At present civil society is only recognised in the text of the Cotonou Agreement. It needs to come off the printed page and be put into practice! When we revise the ALA Regulation, it is essential to include this aspect in our cooperation with the countries of Latin America and Asia, which would also make it possible to make funds available to non-state actors in those countries. Involving non-state actors in their governments' development strategy is essential to guaranteeing pluralism, freedom of expression and democracy, which underpin the European Union's missions throughout the world. We are therefore pleased to welcome this report by Mr Howitt. It opens up important avenues that we must not fail to explore.

 Mr President, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the Cancun conference and the preparatory talks are far from being completed, especially in the sectors thought to be favourable to the developing countries. The fact that the dismantling of agricultural subsidies remains very limited shows the lack of enthusiasm on the part of the rich countries for giving up their privileges; the US is the worst offender, despite having joined in the development round. The European Union, obsessed by its own interests, has also revised CAP reform downwards. Revising the TRIPS agreement to ban the patenting of living things ought to be a priority at Cancun. If intellectual property rights are applied to all forms of life, they violate the sovereign rights of states and populations to protect their resources and skills and deny the very existence of public good. Negotiators, if you want Cancun to be a success, then listen to the call from the Africa group and drop the Singapore issues. The absence of solutions to the famous paragraph 6 of the Doha declaration on access to medicines proves that our governments are under pressure from the pharmaceuticals firms and are afraid to adopt a bold and truly humane stance. Once again, there is a great risk that in the outcome a compromise solution will be vaunted that would have been considered unacceptable at the outset. In Egypt last week, the US seemed to take a step forward by dropping a restrictive list of diseases. There then remains the problem of which countries are eligible. What is meant by sufficient manufacturing capacity? Rather than accept a second-rate compromise, should we not rather start again with a new basis for negotiations that will result in an economic and practical solution for the developing countries? Let us not forget the spirit of Doha. Nothing must prevent countries from protecting their population’s health. In particular, nothing must prevent any member from taking part in the WTO talks fairly and transparently. We will be particularly vigilant about this when we are in Cancun. Commissioner, I am asking you not to go back on our commitments. The Doha round must be the round of the developing countries. Nature and human beings are not commodities. The environment and health are more important than the WTO rules. Do not undermine the European Union’s credibility and good faith. Work for sustainable and fair solutions in Cancun.

 Mr President, I must admit that I am pleased to hear Mr Byrne side with consumers against the pharmaceutical industry. We had the feeling, when addressing the pharmaceutical industry dossier and pharmaceutical legislation at the same time, that it was actually the European Parliament that was defending consumers, through far-reaching amendments, in particular on marketing authorisations, on centralised procedure and on consumer protection. The Commission’s answers to these questions, let us remember, were not what the European Parliament had hoped to hear. Fortunately, I have the impression today that the Council has reintroduced a number of items, such as the five-year renewal, marketing authorisations, the centralised procedure and stopping direct advertising to patients. All of this leads me to ask you whether your communication will accept a good number of the amendments to pharmaceutical legislation that Parliament has adopted by a large majority, particularly in the fields of direct advertising, consumer participation in the EMEA, centralised procedure and modifying marketing authorisation dossiers, as real proof of your concern to protect consumers and patients?

 Mr President, the coffee market is currently undergoing a serious crisis. Coffee sector workers are no longer able to make a living from production. Market prices, set by the four main multinationals, which make indecent profits, are too low to allow farmers to make the profits they need in order to continue their activity. Furthermore, as the coffee is being produced at too high a yield, its very quality is declining. As a result of the absence of an international system to stabilise coffee prices and prices of raw materials in general, the situation of coffee farmers is not viable. We must put an end to this spiral of productivism, which, in defiance of any social or environmental legislation, is leading to poverty for millions of farmers in poor countries. Some might say it is simply a coincidence that this crisis is taking place now that the Stabex system has disappeared from the Cotonou agreement. The new rapid payment system, furthermore, makes it impossible to help coffee-producing countries. As the main importer of coffee, the European Union bears the main responsibility in resolving this crisis. The European Union must set up an urgent programme, financed with the funds remaining from previous EDFs, in order to make up the shortfall in revenue of the people and countries concerned. We call on the Commission to produce a communication on basic products as a matter of urgency. Similarly, the Commission must support the International Coffee Organisation’s quality-improvement programme. In the longer term, the European Union must implement, for example within the framework of national and regional development plans, a range of measures designed to combat the volatility of coffee prices and prices of other basic products. The European Union must support diversification in Southern farmers’ production and high-quality agriculture, and contribute to increasing the power of coffee farmers against the agri-foods industries. In particular, the Commission must support the establishment of fair trade structures and facilitate market access for fair trade products. A Commission communication on this matter is becoming increasingly necessary. The matter of stabilising prices for raw materials, upon which the majority of the least developed countries depend, must be approached in the context of multilateral trade negotiations. The ‘development round’ instigated at Doha seems particularly appropriate, if we want developing countries to benefit genuinely from world trade, which is currently more to their disadvantage. The customs tariffs that are still in force for coffee products must therefore be removed. The European Union must use all its power at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancun to ensure that trade with developing countries becomes fairer. Furthermore, we welcome the French proposal to add the matter of raw materials to the agenda for the next G8 summit. As major coffee companies, Nestlé, Kraft, Sara Lee and Procter and Gamble cannot continue to get away with lining their pockets. They must agree to adopt codes of ethical practice in agreement with the ILO and the UN and pay a fair price for raw materials, a price that reflects the social and environmental costs of coffee–growing and production. If farmers and workers in the coffee sector are to receive fair remuneration, fair trade is not just another option but the only sustainable global solution.

 Mr President, we welcome many of the points contained in Mr Liese’s report. In particular we support the amendments which seek to exclude from the scope of this directive tissues and cells originating from human embryos or genetic engineering, insofar as there is no European legislation defining the use of gene therapy. One compromise, however, is causing us problems, and that is the one concerning voluntary and non-remunerated donations of human tissues and cells. What we want is a guarantee that such donations will be unpaid. In order to achieve such a guarantee, it is necessary to define specifically, in this directive, the legitimate and acceptable level of compensation, which in our opinion is the reimbursement of travelling costs and income lost during the period required for the journey, the donation, and any rest period which is necessary, plus refreshments and that sort of allowance, but nothing more. Otherwise we shall be leaving the door open to compensation – or even remuneration – for such donations, with all the foreseeable abuses in terms of quality and safety, and the risks that would result for both donors and recipients. As the previous speaker said, bodies are not commercial goods. Our cells and tissues are not for sale. Another fundamental principle of this directive is that of anonymity, which must be compatible with the traceability of the tissues and cells. The proposal by the European Commission, enhanced by the amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, has succeeded in taking both of these principles into account. The plenary session of this Parliament should not call into question this fragile equilibrium by adopting amendments seeking to remove anonymity from donors of gametes and therefore of sperm donations, or to make tissue and cell distribution records available to the public, and I am referring here to one amendment in particular. The transparency argument is ill-advised in this case. The need to trace tissues and cells destined for transplantation from the donor to the recipient should not work to the detriment of anonymity. That would be to leave the door open to abuses of an ethical, eugenic or even racial nature. Finally, we would ask the Commission, which did not want to include organs within the scope of this directive, to propose as a matter of urgency a specific text for establishing quality and safety standards in respect of organs. I believe that this report is a balanced one. We should continue to work in this direction, including during subsequent readings.

 Mr President, the Green Paper presented by the Commission and the reports presented this morning are along the right lines. We should indeed establish all the elements that guarantee consumers a high level of protection without delay. They must feel sure that their rights are fully and equally respected everywhere. In order to achieve this high level of protection, it is therefore vital to involve representative consumer organisations in drawing up both Community and international policies. As a number of significant changes are currently taking place in terms of trade, it is essential to consult our citizens. They must be able to take part in debates and influence decisions that primarily concern them. Consumers must play an active part through their consumption, which should no longer be uninformed. Instead, consumers should be able to make informed choices. They must therefore be protected, but also kept informed. In order to achieve this, they must be able to have access to all the information they consider essential, for example with the opportunity to find out about production processes, including employees’ working conditions. Community-level logos relating to fair trade or to companies that observe a social charter, are therefore valuable, effective instruments, as are those representing organic farming. If we want to see ethical, fair trade, we need to restate our preference for quality products that do not endanger human dignity, in areas as varied as coffee or children’s toys, and that fulfil all the criteria of the precautionary principle. In this context, traceability of GMOs seems, once again, to be one of the most basic factors. In particular, we must not, as implied by some amendments, allow consumer confidence in GMOs to increase. On the contrary, our duty is to protect consumers and provide them with accurate, comprehensive information that will enable them to make fully informed choices, what they feel are the right decisions for themselves and for their children. We should also emphasise the need for citizen participation in establishing a sustainable model of society. We must not reduce the citizens to mere consumers. Quite the opposite, citizens must play a full part in identifying their needs, so that society itself chooses to develop in a way that can respond to them.

 Thank you, Commissioner, for your extremely clear response to this question. We raised this question, which we consider to be important, because although today it concerns the circuit at Spa-Francorchamps, it will of course also concern others likewise affected by this directive on tobacco. We personally, by the way, are strongly in favour of the directive banning tobacco advertising. We feel it is very important for health problems to take precedence over the problems raised by banning tobacco advertising and we are extremely concerned about the International Automobile Federation’s position in this regard. As you emphasised, and as already discussed with Commissioner Byrne, the latter is currently examining the possibility of extending the ban on tobacco advertising worldwide, in other words, working with the WHO on this issue. Naturally, the measures currently taken by the automobile federations are extremely worrying for those who are trying to limit any encouragement of smoking, which we all know is extremely harmful to health. Furthermore, the automobile federations’ measures will lead to distortions with regard to employment, and, in particular, in the field of sport, which will also be extremely damaging.

 Mr President, I am amazed and saddened that this matter should be back up for discussion. In November 2001, the developing countries were rejoicing in the Doha Declaration, which authorised them to have recourse to compulsory licences for public health reasons. There is just one cloud on the horizon: countries with no production capacity must have the medicines they need manufactured in another country and a company may only manufacture a medicine if 51% of its production is intended for the national market. This problem in paragraph 6 should have been solved before the end of 2002. It has still not been solved. In the meantime, the American pharmaceutical laboratories, who are the main financial backers for the Bush campaign, have returned to the attack. The proposals made by the United States or the European Union, which are each more restrictive than the last, have resulted in failure. Today, the Trips Council is proposing to return to the previous wording allowing recourse to compulsory licences in urgent cases, a solution that proved inapplicable and led to the Doha Declaration. The objective of paragraph 6 must be to ensure that countries with no production capacity can genuinely use compulsory licences. On the contrary, however, some proposals create discrimination between first-class countries with a production capacity and second-class countries with no production capacity, which are, in fact, the poorest countries. The former will be able to use compulsory licences to manufacture any medicine that responds to a public health problem that they themselves have identified, whereas the latter will have to prove that they are experiencing a national situation of urgency. Although, in theory, all countries may have recourse to compulsory licences, in practice, the poorest countries will have to fight to have urgent situations recognised, obtain their licence and have their medicines manufactured. This proposal is unacceptable and I would ask you, Mr Lamy, to propose a solution that is genuinely beneficial to developing countries so that health takes precedence over profit, as you yourself said so well.

 Mr President, there is famine upon famine in Africa. We are appalled to see children dying of hunger, but we do not tackle the causes. Famines are the result not only of weather conditions but also of the structural policies, especially agricultural and trade policies, which have led farmers in poorer countries to produce for export rather than for local consumption. The use of food aid is not a viable solution. Though claiming to be humanitarian, it has often been used by rich countries as a way of disposing of their agricultural surplus and of legitimising their devastating policy of over-production. Thus, the United States is keen to send to Africa its GMOs, which are being boycotted on the European market, not only in the form of food but also as seeds. It then has the audacity to accuse governments which refuse this aid of allowing their populations to die. To use such blackmail on vulnerable people is shameful. It goes against the fundamental right to food, which gives all human beings the freedom to choose what they eat. Who is the more guilty here? Is it the countries affected by famine who refuse to feed their people with potentially harmful products, or is it the countries who supply aid to deprived people only in the form of genetically modified seed, the consequences of which will be disastrous for the environment and for biodiversity? In some of these countries or regions, the food crisis is not a general crisis. The problem is not necessarily the lack of food, but rather the fact that it is not distributed fairly throughout the world. Only local production and intra-regional trade are sustainable and able to guarantee access to food for everyone. The European Union, however, extols the virtues of free trade at world level and forces the developing countries to open their markets. In return, it promises to open its market to all products from the least developed countries, except arms – and, of course, bananas, and sugar and the rest. Not only has this measure caused competition between developing countries rather than strengthening their market shares, it is also encouraging the production of crops for export, to the detriment of food crops that would enable them to be self-sufficient. In the same way, the current crisis among coffee producers is a reminder that free trade means that small farmers are being ruined while the big multinationals prosper. Free trade is not fair trade. Moreover, there is no reference to fair trade in the new Commission Communication entitled ‘Trade and development’, which Parliament will shortly have occasion to examine. President Lula made the fight against hunger his top priority. He is proposing to create an international fund for this purpose. That is also the objective of the FAO, whose recent summit does not seem to have had any significant impact. In the opinion of the Greens, the only way of eradicating hunger throughout the world is by the sustainable development of food production which is based on the needs of local populations, and fair trade between North and South – in other words, trade which pays a fair price that reflects the social and environmental costs of production and the resources and workers of poorer countries.

 Mr President, the action programme to counter poverty diseases which the European Union is setting up is vital, but it must be complete. The people in the South are still dying of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, but our words speak louder than our actions. These people also suffer from dengue, trypanosomoses and other filariases, but I am sad to say that nothing is being done to combat these diseases. Above all I deplore the informal procedure which has prevailed until today’s debate. Having been subjected to strong pressure from the Commission and the Council to adopt this regulation at first reading, so as to allow the programme to come into force quickly, we have actually suffered real blackmail at the hands of these institutions, which are determined to weaken this report and to undermine our powers of codecision. We were surprised at their reluctance to accept a precise reference to the declaration on public health and intellectual property adopted at Doha, and the rights that it gives developing countries with regard to access to medicines. What happened to those European declarations emphasising health before profits? On many occasions, the European Parliament has reaffirmed that access to treatments at cost price is inseparable from prevention, from the strengthening of health systems and structures, particularly the public services, and from research and development. The Commission had seemed to be receptive to Parliament’s arguments as long as they were not binding. Faced with this legislative regulation, however, its attitude changed. Thus in Geneva last December, in the context of the negotiations at the TRIPS Council, the Member States and the Commission could hardly be said to have been inspired by the European Parliament’s resolutions on access to medicines. The European Union’s preferred solution for countries which, not having any production capacity of their own, have to import medicines under compulsory licence from other countries was totally unworkable for developing countries. By an ironic twist of fate, this bad agreement was rejected by the United States, which wanted to reduce its scope even further. The general budget for the programme has also been revised downwards: EUR 350 million for a five-year programme is very little when we consider what is at stake, and it is much less than the EUR 500 million originally requested. In conclusion, I would say that we should adopt this regulation as a matter of urgency, but not at the price of democracy. We Members of the European Parliament are here not to promote our own selfish interests, but to promote the interests of the citizens of the world.

Madam President, the situation in the Congo is tragic. Millions of citizens are living in appalling conditions. Famine and AIDS are the daily lot of men and women in the grip of an interminable conflict, stirred up by the presence of so-called elite networks who are taking advantage of a chaotic situation in order to make a profit. The top political leaders, regional and foreign companies and the armed forces have established what appears to be a real war economy. They are stirring up, under the cover of political or ethnic opposition, a conflict whose only goal has become to simply plunder the natural resources of the DRC, to the detriment of the local populations. The United Nations report that we presented to the Committee on Development and Cooperation is, in our opinion, a significant opportunity to put an end to this human tragedy. The list of people involved in this damaging trafficking should be the spearhead for us to launch genuine and forceful action. Ladies and gentlemen, we now need to put pressure on our own companies to stop taking advantage of confused situations or even creating them in order to make a fraudulent profit. We should not delude ourselves any longer. The responsibility of companies is now closely linked to that of our governments. If we do not promptly give a strong political signal by taking restrictive action against them and stressing our support for the principles of the OECD, they will continue to violate the law and human rights without batting an eyelid. We can no longer turn a blind eye to what is nothing more and nothing less than neo-colonial plundering in disguise. By forcing European companies in foreign countries to make their accounts public, we will enable greater transparency and will also limit the illegal misappropriation of which the Congolese people are the prime victims. It is clear that establishing the rule of law and democratic institutions will be essential. But prior coordinated action among Member States aimed at putting an end to their own companies' activities has become essential. It is high time that the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo benefited fully and directly from their land’s resources and achieved the level of development that their mining resources would allow if they were not constantly being illegally exploited by foreign powers.

 Mr President, for our part, the revision of the pharmaceutical legislation must aim, first and foremost, to ensure the safety, quality and efficacy of medicinal products available on the European market, in order to protect public health. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has taken this into account by voting – by a broad majority – against any direct to consumer advertising for prescription medicines, whilst increasing the transparency of market authorisation procedures. Patients have a right to objective and reliable information on illnesses and on the therapies available to treat them. What better information can we give than to make available to the public the database containing all the medicinal products registered at the Agency, together with the evaluation report on these products, the reasons for their authorisation or their rejection and the explanatory leaflet on the results of clinical trials, be they positive or negative? On the contrary, information obtained by the pharmaceutical industry alone cannot be objective and more or less equates to advertising direct to consumers. Furthermore, it seems important that stricter rules be adopted when promoting medicinal products for use by professionals, which is what, in fact, happens in my own country. We must increase the transparency and independence of the Agency by making it accessible to consumer and patient representatives. The safety and the quality of medicines are based on a scientific evaluation, which highlights the risks and benefits of the product. The risk/benefit 

relationship makes it possible to determine whether or not the market authorisation can be issued. This must be re-assessed, however, in order to take into account the effects related to its use as well as any new scientific data available. The administrative burden involved in the five-yearly renewal of the market authorisation in no way justifies the immediate withdrawal of any periodic re-evaluation of new medicinal products, in particular. That is why we are proposing that at least a re-evaluation takes place once the product has been on the market for five years. Far from running counter to the new provisions on pharmacovigilance, this measure clearly strengthens the safety of medicinal products. Similarly, we are refusing to reduce the time spent on the scientific evaluation of medicinal products, under the centralised procedure as well as the decentralised procedure, and even in the case of the accelerated procedure or the reduction protocol that we support. Lastly, the effectiveness of a medicinal product can only be demonstrated when it is compared to that of other medicinal products available to treat the same conditions. Is it any good developing new medicines which add nothing in therapeutic terms or to maintain products that have been overtaken by new medical technologies? The initial evaluation, and that carried out after five years, provide the opportunity to weigh up the added therapeutic value of medicinal products. This measure can only motivate European research and innovation. Finally, we are opposed to the amendments which seek to limit the centralised procedure and to encourage the procedure of mutual recognition, or even to delay generic products coming onto the market. We welcome the adoption in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy of the amendments on the impact of medicinal products on the environment. My fellow Members have supported us on this issue and we are rather pleased by this. To sum up, Mr President, although pharmaceutical companies have, by and large, been backed up in the Commission’s initial proposals, we have a duty – and this must be the mission of the European Parliament – to protect the interests of citizens, patients and consumers.

 Madam President, recent events, marked by a number of assassinations in Côte d’Ivoire, are extremely worrying. The military uprising against the current official government is unjustifiable, despite the worsening economic and political conditions. The unprecedented economic crisis, related to the fall in the price of raw materials, and particularly of coffee and cotton, has caused further hardship and poverty in the country. It is also clear, however, that the lack of respect for the concept of Ivorian birthright, which came to a head during the presidential elections in 2000, has served only to intensify the climate of hate and violence in the country, and the accusations that neighbouring countries are supporting the rebels could be used to justify the persecution of the immigrant civilian populations. In this respect, we must welcome the statement made by President Gbagbo which calls for foreigners to be protected. It should also be taken on board by his troops. The risk of an outbreak of xenophobia among civilians is indeed great. We must avoid being caught up in a civil war between ethnic groups, a crisis situation similar to that in the Congo, which would be extremely dangerous and regrettable for Côte d’Ivoire and all its inhabitants. Therefore, although we may lament the failure of mediation efforts by the ECOWAS which proposed the resumption of negotiations between the government and the rebels, the intervention forces should not impose an actual division of ethnic groups on the ground. The European Union must support the legitimate government in order to restore the rule of law and to protect the civilian populations, of all ethnic origins. In the longer term, a committee of enquiry should be set up in order to discover the causes of these events and to condemn those responsible. The European Union must ensure respect for the principles of human rights, of democracy and of political pluralism, but also, and this is crucial, encourage the economic and social development of Côte d’Ivoire.

Unfortunately, the World Food Summit organised by the Food and Agriculture Organization has demonstrated that the fears I expressed to this very House a month and a half ago were entirely warranted. The absence of thirteen European Heads of State from the Summit and the Italian Prime Minister’s request that the end of the meeting be brought forward because of a football match graphically illustrate how little interest famine in the world generates in our countries. One international conference takes place after another – Monterrey, Rome, Johannesburg; Europe would have the world believe that development is its chief concern. At the same time, however, it abolishes the European Union Development Council, and the Directorate-General for Development may also be axed soon. And we abstain from any binding involvement or commitment whatsoever on behalf of the poorest populations. This was the other huge disappointment at the Summit, where we confined ourselves to subscribing to commitments that had previously been undertaken without any means of obtaining the tangible resources required for their fulfilment. This, incidentally, had happened in Monterrey too, but it was even worse in Rome. Mr Berlusconi even had the effrontery to cast doubt on the duty of the industrialised countries to assist the developing countries in their desperate plight, invoking the precept that ‘God helps those who help themselves’. Likewise, the WTO helps the United States and the European Union to maintain and even increase their export subsidies on farm produce, subsidies which fly in the face of the sacrosanct principle of free trade proclaimed by those same two parties and which are used to a great extent to the detriment of the poor countries that are the main exporters of raw materials. How can anyone attach any credit to a US Administration that has just increased its subsidies to cotton farmers or to the governments of the EU Member States that refused to commit themselves in Doha to a timetable for the reduction of their subsidies on agricultural exports? We are disappointed by the resolution that the European Parliament has proposed, because it fails to condemn the gulf between the words of our governments and their deeds. The Roman Emperors used to have a formula for appeasing their poorest citizens: bread and circuses. I believe there were certainly circuses this time in Rome, but the bread was forgotten.

Equatorial Guinea 
is at present the scene of unacceptable violations of basic human rights. Dozens of opponents of the regime of President Teodoro Obiang have been arbitrarily arrested and brought before the courts accused of conspiracy, incitement to rebellion and attempted murder of the president. In reality, the only purpose of the trial, which began on 23 May, is to put the opposition leaders out of the running. Along with their families, the latter are being held in inhuman conditions and are the victims of brutal torture. Freedom of expression and of the press is systematically flouted, and independent journalists are subject to insidious daily pressure. A repressive and brutal policy is being conducted against everyone with an ideology opposed to that of the regime. The 68 opposition leaders have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment in the course of an unfair trial, which has made a mockery of people’s most basic rights to a defence. A number have even been in danger of receiving the death penalty. It is vital that Equatorial Guinea respect its commitments to the international community and the European Union and engage in a genuine process of democratisation including the holding of free elections and complete respect for human rights. A dialogue must be instituted between the opposition forces with a view to guaranteeing political rights, democracy and pluralism. With this in mind, the trial must be annulled and the political prisoners freed immediately. As for the press, it must be free to cover the events and to do so in safety. In order for that to happen, it is essential that the problem of Equatorial Guinea be raised as a matter of urgency within the Joint ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly and that the Council and the Commission be very firm indeed in their relations with the government of this country. In order to guarantee the rapid re-establishment of the rule of law and respect for human rights, a consultation procedure between the government of Guinea and the European Union needs to be put in place as quickly as possible, and this in accordance with Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. As Europeans, we cannot now remain indifferent to what is happening in Equatorial Guinea and to the human rights violations there.

 Mr President, I am dismayed by the way in which the human rights situation has developed in Malaysia, particularly since the events of 11 September. Under the pretext of combating terrorism, Malaysia’s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, has made much use of the Internal Security Act, which authorises the detention without trial of anyone suspected of undermining national security, to muzzle all political opposition and to intensify the repressive measures contravening individual freedoms, notably freedom of expression. In a few months, we have moved from the image of a country on the up and up, run by civilised people, to that of a country whose leaders are destroying with their own hands what they have built up. That is why Parliament is duty-bound to condemn these abuses and call upon the Malaysian Government not only to guarantee respect for individual freedoms but also to abolish that notorious Internal Security Act and to ratify without delay the International Convention on Human Civil and Political Rights, the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention Against Torture. It is also vital that the European Parliament send a mission to Malaysia in order to investigate the conditions under which the political prisoners are being detained and the violations of their basic rights. Finally, the European Union should place this issue on the agendas of the forthcoming meetings between the European Union and the ANASE.

 Mr President, I am pleased that Mr Nisticò has included many of our amendments. There are, however, some gaps, requiring amendments to be tabled with a view to ensuring the maximum level of safety of blood products. We therefore consider that all undesirable effects and incidents relating to any stage of the blood donation and transfusion process must be reported, no matter how serious they are. We also consider that it is genuinely essential, in the interests of quality and patient information, for a medical examination to be carried out on all blood donors before blood is taken. Secondly, the question of remuneration for blood donations is fundamental. Most European countries have a system of voluntary, unpaid blood donations. We cannot accept any challenges to this principle, and we believe it should be extended to the whole of the European Union. From an ethical point of view, we cannot defend the idea of selling blood or, indeed, any other component of the body. The human body is not a commodity. In this respect, we find it extremely shocking that companies can make a profit from free blood donations. The remuneration of donations could be counter-productive in terms of quality. Donors motivated by financial gain might be led to deny any health problems they may have, which could have tragic consequences – as in China – for their own health and for the health of recipients. I am not denying the risks in terms of blood supplies, but I think we can motivate potential donors by means other than money. It is in order to ensure that the objectives of this directive, the quality and safety of human blood, are achieved that I am calling on my fellow Members to vote for our amendments.

 Mr President, one billion people do not have access to drinking water and three million die every year from diseases caused by poor water quality or lack of water. There are 800 million starving people in the world and 24 000 people die of hunger every day. Twenty-eight million people are living with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa, of whom 2.3 million died of AIDS last year. These figures are telling and are all too well-known. The Heads of State and Government, however, are absent from the World Food Summit in Rome this week. These same ministers were incapable of making specific commitments in Bali. The World Health Fund is sorely lacking in financial resources. Worse still, most of the conventions concluded since Rio, ten years ago, are still not being applied. This, of course, is due to the attitude of the United States Government and the multinationals. The worst polluters of the planet deny their culpability and refuse to take action with regard to the victims, the countries of the southern hemisphere. What are we Europeans doing, apart from pontificating as we did at Monterrey? How do we think dismissing our development advisers, as was proposed at Seville, will contribute to sustainable development? If the Johannesburg Summit fails, the European Union will have to shoulder its responsibility.

 Obviously I welcome the adoption of a European Parliament resolution on the FAO World Food Summit. After all, it was my group that requested it. Five years after the first summit, it is clear that the progress made – a fall of 40 million in the 800 million who are suffering from hunger – is very small compared with the objective of halving the number of undernourished people by 2015. The resolution contains some interesting paragraphs, such as the one about the need for the new WTO round to focus on development and food security and the need for concomitant reforms of the common agricultural policy and common fisheries policy. Overall, however, the commitments made are very weak: the resolution does not recognise the supremacy of the right to food, or to sovereignty over food supplies, and neither does it tackle the structural factors which generate food insecurity. In fact, as we are well aware, it is not the quantity of food available in the world that is the problem, but the way that it is distributed amongst those who live there. The new technologies on reproduction, in particular genetically modified organisms, will not change anything either; quite the opposite. Thanks to these seeds and genetic technologies, small farmers and the people who live in the South are even more at the mercies of the multinationals. Not only are these firms tightening their grip on farmers by selling them their magic seeds; they are also encouraging them to produce food for consumers in the North, to the detriment of their own needs. This explains why three quarters of the people suffering from hunger in developing countries are small farmers. The time has come to put an end to unfair commercial rules and practices where trade in agricultural goods is concerned. The European Union should not delay in scrapping its export subsidies. It is not enough to talk about joined-up Community policies; this principle also needs to be applied in practice. The objective of the millennium is to halve poverty by 2015, not to protect our farmers, our fishing fleets and our agri-food industries; that is why we will be asking you to support our amendments. The best way to fight famine is actually to give access to the earth, access to water and access to genetic resources back to the people of the South, and to protect their farmers and their own markets.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall come straight to the point. We must quite simply cancel the debts of highly indebted poor countries and put in place an arbitration procedure for intermediary countries that are in crisis, such as Argentina. Most of these debts are illegitimate, as they were arranged by corrupt, even dictatorial governments, and have, in fact, never been used to benefit the population. The total amount of third-world debt has already been repaid six times over in interest. What a paradox this is! Today, the debt repayments made by the countries of the south are higher than the development aid provided by the north. Having pillaged the raw materials of the south at the lowest possible price, the north is now benefiting from this financial flux and is maintaining its de facto domination, which consequently makes the problem of poverty worse. We must, therefore, cancel this debt. However, the money that is saved from doing this must be reinvested, not in arms or in anything else, but in social budgets that will first and foremost improve public services, health and education. Unfortunately, the Monterrey conference did not tackle this issue in any depth, nor that of introducing a tax on financial transactions. As for setting the official development aid target of 0.39% of GDP, this is no victory. We still have a long way to go before we reach 0.7%. In ten years’ time, will we be satisfied with the 0.22% that we have formally committed? No, I think that we must take action now. We must cancel the debt now. We must grant a great deal more than 0.39% of GDP for aid, and I personally think that the Monterrey conference was a failure. It was a failure for the European Union, but, more importantly, it was a failure for the countries of the south.

Mr President, the dominant theme of 2001 for the ACP countries was the entry into force of the Cotonou agreement. Its ratification by the European Parliament in January will encourage the Member States to follow that example, thus enabling the financial part to be implemented. The Joint Parliamentary Assembly has adapted its work according to the new role that it has been given, in particular to promote democratic processes. As a forum for the expression of the will of the people and of democratic values, it has a central role to play. But its powers are limited. It remains just a platform for political expression, without any decision-making or executive powers. It should therefore be given new powers, both political as well as financial and operational, and the logistical resources to go with them. A working group responsible for evaluating the involvement of civil society in the partnership should therefore be created. In the same way, parliamentarians should be involved in the forthcoming negotiations on the future ACP-EU trade regime. We will therefore vote with conviction in favour of Mrs Carlotti’s report, which makes excellent proposals on the other points, as she set out a while ago, while pointing out that the way that the ACP countries will become democratic is by making the associated institutions and development cooperation more democratic in general.

Mr President, the European Parliament was behind the creation of a budget heading for decentralised cooperation in the 1990s. The Lomé Convention Section 4a also incorporated this idea, thus departing from the principle of cooperation between States. Now, according to the Commission, the concept has gained ground and proved that it is valid and effective. The Commission is therefore proposing that its application should be extended by two years. We can only approve that proposal, although we have reservations regarding its form. As well as the fact that it is transitory, the Regulation remains vague. It contains a little of everything: decentralised cooperation, civil society and NGOs. Could it be that there is a lack of Commission strategy in this area? In the same way, the Cotonou Agreement dedicates the participation of civil society in the ACP countries to the partnership, at the expense of decentralised cooperation, which seems to have disappeared. The communication on civil society in developing countries promised by the Commission several months ago should have clarified these notions and set out a coordinated approach for the European Union in this area, but we are still awaiting it. The two areas of ‘aid for decentralised cooperation’ and ‘aid for civil society’ go hand in hand. In both cases, the goal is to support local dynamics, avoiding the cumbersome nature and sometimes the lack of transparency of implementing national programmes. The Commission appears to have realised this, as it plans to merge these two budget headings, but the limited adjustments that are being made, without consulting the European Parliament, are not sufficient. The transfers of funds from one budgetary heading to another demonstrate a lack of an overall perspective and show little consideration for the budgetary authority. We are, of course, in favour of direct aid to projects on the ground. But we are somewhat irritated with last minute action. This reform of the budget can only be done as part of a thorough review of the concept of decentralised cooperation and of relations with the NGOs of the North and the South. These two extra years should therefore be used for in-depth discussion on the European Union’s cooperation with local players in developing countries and their contribution to sustainable development. We should look at the definitions: what is decentralised cooperation, cooperation between sub-national entities in the North and South or aid to local and regional authorities in developing countries? What is civil society? This question is becoming increasingly urgent with the implementation of the Cotonou Agreement. The real question is in fact the more general one of governance and democracy. In order for the countries of the South to develop they will have to become democratic, which means that citizens need to become involved in directing the country. They can take part in several ways: by voting for local, regional or national governments. In this respect, support for elections and increasing institutional capacity at the different levels of decision-making and administration are essential. They can also take an economic and social role in companies or associations. Direct aid to NGOs and SMEs is therefore equally important. These two aspects are not contradictory but do in fact complement each other. The Commission must continue the debate and continue to push it forward as it is high time that we provided the local populations with the resources for development.

 Mr President, the results of the first round of the presidential elections, which were held on 16 December 2001 in Madagascar, have been the subject of great controversy and conflict between the two leading candidates, namely the outgoing president, Didier Ratsiraka, and his rival Marc Ravalomanana. It is claimed that Mr Ratsiraka has rigged the election results and his intentions remain a mystery. He is not stepping down and his silence is leading to fears of violent actions being carried out by his supporters. Although the Ministry of Home Affairs attributes only a small majority to Mr Ravalomanana, he is claiming to have won the first round and is calling for the second round to be cancelled. However, the official results mean that the two men must face one another in a second round and the international community is hoping and praying that it will be organised. Mr Ravalomanana appears to enjoy the support of the people, as hundreds of thousands of people have demonstrated in his favour, bringing the country to a standstill with a general strike and claiming victory over the opposition. This strike is having disastrous consequences for Madagascar’s economy, and last week cost between USD 8-10 million. The losses incurred, following 10 days of strike action, have already exceeded Madagascar’s annual education budget. Let there be no misunderstanding about this. This is not a question of us supporting one candidate over another, and I have no more sympathy for Mr Ravalomanana than Mr Ratsiraka. What could be a cause for concern for the future are his autocratic tendencies, which came to the fore when he was the capital’s mayor, and if elected, Madagascar’s power would be in his hands. Human rights supporters are becoming disillusioned. But what we need, first and foremost, is respect for democracy and the Rule of Law. That is why it is essential that the two candidates agree to the ballot being checked and that the High Constitutional Court agrees to compare the results. This comparison is the only democratic means of establishing the real results of the ballot. The Commission must do everything in its power to resolve this conflict, which is pulling the country apart, but also to help in establishing a genuine Rule of Law. The conflict must be resolved with respect for human, political and civil rights, but also for political pluralism. Respect for fundamental principles is essential in consolidating the democratic process.

 Mr President, we, who supported Eritrea’s struggle for independence, are alarmed by the changes in this country's governing authorities, while the tragic consequences of the recent conflict with Ethiopia are already causing suffering. In September 2001, 11 members of the Eritrean opposition, including several former ministers who had published a letter calling for a return to democracy by the ruling party, were arrested by the government. As well as the arrests, a ban, described by the authorities as temporary, was imposed on the private press. The elections were also adjourned and the formation of new political parties was prohibited. Journalists and Eritrean dissident politicians were gagged by the regime. These repressive measures, which violate freedom of expression, are worrying and unacceptable. They blatantly contradict the Eritrean authorities’ proclaimed desire to undertake democratic reforms. Furthermore, the expulsion in October 2001 of the Italian ambassador, who represented the European Union on the ground, severely undermined relations with Eritrea. Yet, in order to enable relations between Eritrea and the European Union to return to normal, it is essential that human rights and fundamental freedoms be respected. For this to happen, the Eritrean Government must not only release all political prisoners and journalists, but it must also lift the ban on all independent journalists. That is why the European Union must re-examine its relations with Eritrea in the light of the Cotonou Agreement, Article 96 of which calls for an inter-Eritrean national conference to be held, bringing together the various political leaders and representatives of civil society, with a view to finding a solution to the current crisis and to setting the country on the path to democracy and sustainable development.

 Mr President, we must welcome the International Conference on Financing for Development, as this is an essential theme in the debate on reducing aid to developing countries. For more than 20 years, the UN has told donor countries that they must dedicate 0.7% of their GNP to state development aid, in accordance with OECD standards, but only four countries are respecting this commitment. Aid is decreasing in general and the current average is 0.2%. Developing countries are suffering badly from the gradual and structural deterioration in trade terms for basic products and are caught up in the vicious cycle of paying back often illegitimate debts, as well as the interest charged on them. How can we raise financial resources for the human, economic and social development of these people, given these circumstances? Our hopes rest on Monterrey therefore, unless the outcome has already been determined and the American positions dominate this conference, as was the case at Doha. By faithfully following the liberal principles of development that the international institutions and the European Commission have been applying for 20 years, the document before us, just as the Monterrey consensus, never calls neo-liberal globalisation into question. However, the income of the population of developing countries has continued to fall over the same period, which proves this formula is ineffective and counter-productive. It is failing, but we carry on regardless. I do not know if the draft consensus for Monterrey, which does not propose any ambitious objectives, any practical financial measures or a timetable, is set in stone. If that is the case, and if the conference limits itself to making wonderful statements which will never be followed up, I think that we must cancel it and the millions of euro that have been earmarked to organise the conference must be given directly to the least-advanced countries. It would be a shame because there are grounds to condemn and criticise, but there are also grounds to discuss and, in relation to mobilising aid, propose cancelling debt, taxing capital and reforming the WTO. The European Union must seize this opportunity to push through the adoption of ambitious objectives as well as restrictive measures, which could enable poverty levels to be cut in half by 2015. The EU must reiterate the commitment made at Gothenburg to request the Member States to increase their aid to 0.7%. The governments and parliaments which agreed to the principle of a Tobin-type tax must demonstrate their interest in regulating the financial markets and redistributing wealth towards the south. Mr President, all those taking part in the summit must ensure that it is a success. The European Union has a responsibility to do this.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though I adopted a rather critical tone in the report’s explanatory statement, we must nonetheless adopt a constructive approach and, despite the fact that time is getting on, I would recommend that the European Parliament issue an opinion in accordance with the ratification of the ACP-EU agreement. The signing of the Cotonou Agreement was not initially accepted. Although the ACP countries had always shown they were willing to continue their cooperation with the European Union, Europe was becoming involved in other matters. European interests on the international stage changed and Africa became a marginal continent. There are no ACP countries among the 10 leading beneficiaries of European aid. A genuine political assessment of Lomé was never carried out but the same foundations have been used for Cotonou. However, we have doubts regarding the ability of the Cotonou Agreement to provide a dynamic for sustainable development if we do not have a more balanced international economic order, in which the developing countries will finally have rights. The structural causes which have undermined the success of the Lomé Conventions are still present: the burden of debt which is strangling the budgets of the ACP countries and their potential to invest in sustainable development, the continued deterioration of trade terms to the detriment of the ACP countries, in the absence of an international system for trade regulation of primary products, a structural adjustments policy which imposes budgetary restrictions on ACP countries and, lastly, an inconsistent European policy which, like its development policy, not only subsidises agricultural production and exports its surplus to developing countries, thus destabilising the local markets, but also authorises industrial fishing vessels to fish the territorial waters of the ACP countries, which adversely affects the local people’s means of subsistence and compromises the protection of biodiversity. Furthermore, do not underestimate the internal working problems of the ACP group, the democratic shortcomings in certain countries and the misuse of funds by corrupt regimes. The Cotonou Agreement is not groundbreaking. It perpetuates and accentuates the transition towards liberalisation initiated by Lomé IV and continued by the international institutions: that is, the liberalisation of trade, coupled with the withdrawal of the non-reciprocal trade system, as well as Stabex and Sysmin, in favour of the future trade regime which is likely to take the form of Regional Economic Partnership Agreements (REPS) that are compatible with WTO rules. But can the ACP countries contend with global competition? By differentiating them from the least developed countries (LDCs), which benefit from the ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative, is there not a danger that this will undermine the cohesion of the ACP group? There is economic liberalisation as well, within the framework of the general agreement on the commercialisation of services. Privatisation of this economic sector is a very dangerous process in the ACP countries where the basic public services such as education, health and justice are already fragile, even non-existent. Equally, the reference to the TRIPS agreements is a danger for the people of the South who are at risk of being denied access to their own natural resources. Biodiversity is under threat. Furthermore, in the Cotonou Agreement, the environment is relegated to the background and the sole aim is to limit the environmental impact of development policies, which runs counter to a sustainable development strategy. However, the Cotonou Agreement contains some interesting aspects that we must put to good use. Acknowledging civil society as an actor in the partnership is a major step forward. Its representatives must take part in the dialogue on development strategies and policies at an early stage, be involved in the implementation of programmes and directly benefit from the funds. We must define civil society and ensure that it is not exploited by any party. The civil society in each ACP country must therefore be organised at national as well as at regional level, in order to actively participate in its country’s development. This process has been launched with the ACP Civil Society Forum. The European Union must support this process, as it did under the Belgian Presidency. The role of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is thus strengthened in that it must monitor the participation of civil society as well as, and in particular, the implementation of democratic processes. But it has no binding instrument to do this. Political dialogue is another essential element. It must also be reciprocal and effectively implemented. The ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative was undertaken without consulting the ACP countries and penalties are still random. Lastly, since the European Commission wishes to make considerable investments in several key sectors, the National Indicative Programmes should give priority to strengthening public services and administrative and institutional capacities. In reality, everything depends on how the Cotonou Agreement is applied. For example, the new Cotonou Agreement provides for flexible aid planning, in other words, according to how each country performs. But who will define the performance criteria? Will we assess the ability of each country to re-gain some balance in macro-economic affairs or the impact of aid on eradicating poverty? It does not seem likely that the new distribution of competences between the Commission services will provide greater consistency in the development policy. To what extent will the Directorate-General for Trade be able to encourage a more favourable trade model in the ACP countries, whilst also protecting European trade interests? Lastly, the fact that the Directorate-General for Development is gradually being stripped of its prerogatives in this area does not bode well. As far as we, the Members of the European Parliament, are concerned – and this will be my final point, Mr President – after tomorrow’s vote, our task is finished in theory. Since the European Development Fund has no budget, we are no longer responsible for monitoring and achieving the objectives of the ACP-EU cooperation. This is unacceptable and we must work together to implement this agreement so that aid can make a real contribution to the well-being of the people of the ACP countries, as regards their food, health and educational requirements.

 Mr President, Togo is still in a state of political paralysis. The regular condemnations issued by the European Parliament, the most recent of which dates back to September, have had no effect. Human rights are constantly disregarded and democracy remains an elusive utopia. The leader of the students' union, Hounjo Mawudzuro, has been imprisoned. Last August, the chairman of the main opposition party, Yawovi Agboyibo, was sentenced to six months in prison on fallacious grounds. New threats of legal action are hanging over him and President Eyadema will not release him unless he applies for a pardon. In fact only someone who is guilty can apply for a pardon and Yawovi Agboyibo is not guilty. His only crime is to have criticised the regime. He should be released unconditionally and be able to stand as a candidate in the parliamentary elections which are to be held next March. Democracy does not consist solely of holding elections. These are dependent on what happens upstream, and in particular on the rules stating who can vote and who can stand as a candidate, just as we saw in the past in Côte d'Ivoire and as we see today in Congo-Brazzaville. The European Parliament should strongly condemn these new developments and see to it that the elections run smoothly. Only if human rights are respected and the rule of law upheld will it be possible for normal cooperation relations between Togo and the European Union to be resumed. It is necessary to establish a dialogue with the regime and the opposition. This is why the Joint Parliamentary Assembly should send a mission to Togo to report on respect for human rights and the smooth running of the electoral process.

 Doha should have been the development cycle. Yet what have the developing countries gained from Doha? I do not share other Members’ optimism on this point. For instance, the agreement on access to medicines, which appeared to be a victory, is really a decoy to lure the media and the developing countries. Presented as a vital stake at this conference and as a major concession to the developing countries, the clarification of the TRIPS agreement and the interpretation of it – which has always been our interpretation – are admittedly a political victory, but that victory changes nothing from the legal point of view. It is of no value before the body that settles disputes within the WTO, and, as Mrs Kinnock has pointed out, the question remains unresolved for those countries which have no production capacity. For the time being, nothing allows them to use compulsory licensing in order to arrange for the medicines they need to be manufactured by third parties, and this point was emphasised at the recent conference in Ouagadougou. In the same way, the derogation and the WTO’s reciprocity rule, which were granted at the last minute to signatory states of the Cotonou agreement for a period of eight years, appeared to be a positive achievement. In reality, however, that authorisation, which the ACP states had been waiting for for months, seems more like blackmail as far as they are concerned. They were obliged to sign the final Doha declaration or risk having their request refused. The gains were therefore minimal, and were used by the countries of the West, which are united in their desire to launch a new round, as a means of buying what they wanted. In reality, what happened at Doha was more like a cynical play at the theatre. We are becoming increasingly committed to unbridled liberalisation and, as we shall continue to insist, a fundamental reform of the WTO really is essential.

 We want a strong health programme as early as January 2002. It is in Europe’s interest. This is why we do not understand the attitude of the Council which, by not wanting to fill in the details of this programme, is in fact leaving the Commission with all the powers, while Members of the European Parliament will be deprived of any right of review for the next six years. The European Parliament must be consulted about the annual priorities, and I hope that our fellow Members will support us on this point. Far from being innovative, this programme restricts itself mainly to the setting up of an epidemiological monitoring network. As far as we are concerned, this is not the main priority; we already have comparable data from other countries. The Community added value should appear upstream, in the form of a reduction in the health risks emanating, for the most part, from our environment in the broadest sense of the word: transport, pollution, chemicals, food etc., but also from our behaviour and from social, economic and environmental inequalities. We recommend prevention throughout the world, but we have to start by applying it ourselves in our health programme. This programme should also give greater consideration to the risks arising from transmissible diseases, including in the candidate countries. AIDS remains a scourge in Europe, and tuberculosis is resurfacing everywhere. We also need to think about the therapeutic technologies that we wish to give priority to. The ‘all-drug’ approach has revealed its limitations with the increasing levels of resistance to antibiotics and vaccines. It is time to take other methods and replacement treatments into consideration, but this should also be done on the basis of relevant evaluations. Finally, we cannot give in on this matter of the budget. Even EUR 380 million over a period of six years is not enough. By sticking at EUR 280 million, the Council would be demonstrating a desire to restrict the actions of the European Union on public health issues, which is something that we cannot comprehend. That is why we support Mr Trakatellis’ report, which is the result of numerous exchanges between us and which enables us to demonstrate to the Council that the European Parliament’s opinions on health matters must be taken into consideration. They are reasonable and they are essential to the health of all Europeans.

 Mr President, we are unanimously opposed to reproductive cloning, which shows how dangerous it is. However, why should we distinguish it, semantically, from therapeutic cloning, when it is actually the same thing? Does the addition of the word ‘therapeutic’ change the act? Have we been able to separate civil nuclear energy from military nuclear energy? This is all the more important since these new techniques require the accelerated production of oocytes, and we know what that means in terms of the exploitation of women’s bodies, the secondary effects on women, and the trafficking in human eggs. Moreover, research on adult stem cells opens up the same prospects, though without the ethical problem. I should just like to say a word about ‘gene therapy’. More often than not, the genetic element is a predisposition to a disease, and it is external factors which trigger the onset of that disease. Are we going to modify a gene merely on account of a predisposition, when we now know, following the discovery of the human genome, that a gene modifies other functions which are as yet unknown to us? Ladies and gentlemen, it is not on the basis of any religious conviction, but rather as an atheist, that I strongly urge caution.

 Mr President, we have long been calling for an increase in funds for AIDS given the appalling situation. The European Parliament has made its stance on this issue clear in voting for the Khanbhai report. We were naturally very encouraged by the decision to release a further EUR 120 million. However, the proposal put before us today, after some prevarication, only amounts to EUR 60 million. Furthermore, this will come from the existing budget. This is not extra money. These funds are not ongoing. We also wish to question the allocation of this money to a single international fund. What is the aim of this fund? Is it only for prevention? Or will it also provide access to treatment for people living in the countries of the South? Will it provide health care infrastructures and medicines? These are the questions we must ask. How will this fund be managed? How will those that need this money, namely the countries of the South, be involved in these decisions? It is not simply up to the donor countries. I think that we must ask ourselves all these questions because people are dying everyday, but we have money and it is up to us to help them.

 Mr President, between 22 and 24 October last, Nigerian soldiers raged among the people of Benue state. Over 200 civilians were killed in this massacre and houses and market stalls were burned down. There must be a swift, impartial, effective inquiry into these massacres. The Nigerian Federal government must guarantee full respect for the Constitution and the rule of law without delay. It is not doing so, despite the hopes placed in it. The Nigerian army is incapable of restoring law and order; moreover, this is not its role. Only a police force which respects human rights would be able to rebuild trust between the different communities. It is the duty of the European Parliament to condemn these massacres, which come on top of religious intolerance and miscarriages of justice. The way the sharia is currently being wrongly applied in Nigeria is a violation of fundamental human rights, especially the rights of women. Neither European Union nor United Nations resolutions have acknowledged the escalation of the ethnic conflicts in Nigeria. There is an urgent need for a humanitarian aid system to be established for displaced persons and refugees. Lastly, the European Union should implement the procedure laid down by Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.

 Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my full solidarity and the solidarity of my group with the people of Algeria, which has once again been struck by a huge disaster. We who support the Algerian people, particularly in their fight for independence, are shocked by the tragic consequences of the floods in that country. Material and, above all, human loss are jeopardising the country’s development and preserving its excessive structural and political shortcomings. This disaster reveals once again the incompetence of the Algerian government: the way it builds houses and roads in flood plains and decides to block drains allegedly for safety reasons is proof of the utter irresponsibility of its leaders, and this is on top of the corruption and misuse of funds. The government has failed in its primary mission of serving the general interests of the people. It has done nothing to meet the needs of the people or ensure their safety. Therefore, we must call upon the Algerian authorities to make good their past mistakes. This situation must on no account be allowed to occur again either in Algeria or elsewhere. We must no longer allow citizens’ lives to be endangered by irresponsible, self-interested or reprehensible behaviour.

 Madam President, Afghanistan is currently going through a time of uncertainty that will prove crucial for the future. The end of the Taliban dictatorship opens the door to a process of democratic reconstruction, which, however, is still far from a foregone conclusion. We will probably see Islamist guerrilla warfare on the Algerian model, against which massive bombing is pointless and will have to be halted. The European Union must adopt a strong and clear stance for, as Mrs Emma Bonino and Mr Francis Wurtz said, Afghan women must not be sacrificed in the process of political reconstruction. The participation of women is the key to the lasting reconstruction of Afghanistan. They will have to be present as from the first negotiations and will have to participate in a new government as from the first day. That is the only solution that can guarantee the protection and respect for the rights of women and all human rights. The European Union could not endorse a proposed government that did not take account of this crucial dimension. The integration of women is also a first step towards democracy. Unfortunately, this democracy cannot accommodate warlords who have proved guilty of repeated human rights abuses, a wide range of acts of violence and who, whatever side they are on, are more concerned with defending their ethnic group than with the future of their country. We must put an end to the reign of impunity. The Afghans must be represented by a mixed, democratic government that represents all the ethnic groups and respects human rights.

 Mr President, the new WTO round perfectly illustrates our criticism of the way in which this body is organised. This is supposedly a development round, but the European ministers for cooperation and development are not taking part in the forthcoming meeting. Furthermore, the Committee on Development and Cooperation has not been able to deliver an opinion on the Désir report. Fortunately, the report asks pertinent questions, and it has our support. This is supposed to be a development round, but the 49 LDCs are opposed to it and rightly so. Liberalisation, which is supposed to lead to development, growth and prosperity, has only made their situation worse. The WTO perpetuates the imbalance in world trade and the establishment of rules that are unfavourable to the developing countries. Furthermore, it has ended the preferential system instituted by the Lomé Convention. Similarly, the Cotonou Agreement urges the ACP countries to abide by the GATS or the agreement on Trips but the UNDP, itself, states that the liberalisation of services will only benefit multinational companies. The GATS is basically the IMA by the back door. It is a tool for dismantling democracy. Mr Lamy, if negotiations must take place, then they must focus on a root and branch reform of the WTO. It is the development of the least advanced countries that must benefit rather than the development of multinational companies’ profits.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, resistance to antimicrobial agents now causes hundreds of thousands of deaths the world over. Diseases that we thought were under control, such as tuberculosis or the plague, are re-appearing and are posing a serious threat to human health, particularly in developing countries. We acknowledged, by voting in favour of the Khanbhai report, that resistance to anti-malarial agents was one of the causes of malaria-related deaths. But we now know that one of the true causes of the current situation in Europe is the incorrect use of antibiotics and over-consumption, not only in the field of human medicine but also in animal feed. Reports on GMOs also indicate this…

 My point is directly related to the vote, Mr President, and I was told that I was entitled to speak for one minute, which I have not yet used up. In relation to the voting procedure, I wanted to give just one example to explain why I did not agree with the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party. That one example is this: Today, in the Midwest of the United States, antibiotics are used when rearing chickens. This has created resistance in humans as a result. Yet, it is this antibiotic that we are now using to combat anthrax and I think that this is a very important point.

Mr President, given the millions of deaths in developing countries, the European Commission’s proposal for an action programme against communicable diseases in developing countries is a strong initiative that contributes to affirming the right to health on the international stage. If the European Union wishes to play a distinguished role in this fight and to make its action have a real impact, public health must become a priority for its cooperation in developing countries, and therefore be actually reflected in its budget. This is why we are opposed on this point to the rapporteur’s oral amendments. This is a shame, because we have done a great deal of preparatory work with Mr Khanbhai, in order to strengthen his initial resolution, and the votes of the Committee on Development and Cooperation enabled us to achieve a broad consensus. At the same time, the media coverage of the actions brought by the pharmaceutical industry and the United States against South Africa and Brazil, which produce or import generic anti-AIDS drugs, lifted the veil on the economic stakes and pushed the European Union to specifically commit itself to the side of those poor populations needing access to treatment. Although it makes sense to tackle the fight against tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS in a single programme, we do, however, need to distinguish between the specific problems posed by these three diseases. In the case of tuberculosis, although there is a vaccine for the prevention of this disease, its effectiveness is highly disputed and there is an ever-increasing amount of resistance to treatment. There is no vaccine for malaria and although drugs to treat the disease are inexpensive, they are decreasingly effective due to increased incidences of resistance. There is no vaccine for AIDS nor any treatment that is accessible to the people from the South, as the pharmaceutical laboratories that own the patents keep the prices at an exorbitant level. Moreover, we regret that diseases such as filariasis, trypanosomiasis, sleeping sickness, the Ebola virus or various forms of diarrhoea are not the subject of the Commission’s communication as they are causing an ever-increasing number of deaths. Effective and coherent action against these diseases should therefore offer different solutions depending on the case, but also combine measures on several levels. First of all, prevention involves education and information campaigns, particularly aimed at at-risk groups, such as women and young people, conducted on the ground by influential local figures. For the prevention of AIDS, therefore, promoting the use of condoms is a public health duty. The best form of prevention remains the guarantee of good housing and working conditions, nutrition and health. Development policy as a whole and all Community policies should therefore contribute to the key objective of improving public health. In the same way, we need a more general discussion about the environment. For example, by increasing the amount of stagnant water surfaces, damming policy has caused the number of parasite diseases to rocket. Secondly, it is essential that we improve or even create health structures and train the staff required for the detection, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of these diseases. The European Community development aid programme, specifically within the framework of the EDF, should be focused on health services, which have been neglected for too long due to budgetary restrictions imposed by structural adjustment. The local health NGOs should be able to receive funds in order to carry out their day-to-day work of prevention and of supporting patients. They should be involved in drawing up aid programmes in this field and be incorporated into public health action. Thirdly, everyone should have access to treatment. This means that medication should be sold at cost price to people in developing countries. Another solution would be for these countries to have licences that authorise them to produce generic drugs. In fact, the only way to free the people of the South from the grip of the multinational firms on price fixing for drugs in the long term is to establish a regional or local pharmaceutical industry. The TRIP agreements should be interpreted in the same fashion, and should reaffirm the right of developing countries to use compulsory licences in the event of a health emergency. Pharmaceutical firms need to be made to respect human rights. In fact, following the media pressure over recent months, some of them are taking a greater interest and have promised to reduce their prices. These measures are isolated, however, limited to a few products for a few countries and will take time. Moreover, they are still rejecting the principle of compulsory licences. This rejection of compulsory licences forces us to question the duration of the protection of patents. We could also ask ourselves whether a reduction in the duration of patents is not, after all, an excellent stimulant for research. Fourthly, we need to give new impetus to research, and this is a fundamental point. We need to find new preventive and curative treatments that are more effective, and more importantly better adapted to local populations. For this purpose, an international research centre on Southern diseases, financed by public and private funds, would enable us to completely free research from the purely mercenary interests of certain manufacturers. Finally, and this is what I believe to be the most important point in this debate, is the fact that we know that the very people in the South who are dying from these diseases are urgently waiting for our help, and have been for a long time. I think that we should broadly develop all of these structures. All these concerns have been largely incorporated into Mr Khanbhai’s report. This is why we call on you to vote in favour of the report, and we hope that all of these speeches will for once not go unheeded, because the people of the South need us.

Mr President, Vietnam has once again flouted its international commitments and its own Constitution. The conviction, following a botched trial, on 26 September, of 14 members of the mountain ethnic groups for having peacefully demonstrated in favour of freedom of religion and the establishment of an autonomous area in their province is a fresh illustration of this acknowledged contempt for human rights. They went to join the dozens of prisoners of conscience who are rotting in jail in atrocious conditions, while international human rights observers are unable to get into the country to do their job. The failure to respect individual freedoms should not be tolerated in a country that claims to be democratic and which we have ourselves supported in its fight for independence. The use of the death penalty – more than one hundred sentences passed in 2000 – is also unacceptable. Vietnam, which is an economic and trade partner of Europe, and which has also ratified the international convention on civil and political rights, must respect its international commitments and stop persecuting ethnic minorities. Political liberalisation must go hand in hand with economic liberalisation. Without that, the country cannot be considered by the European Parliament as a democratic State.

Mr President, "Chronicle of a Death Foretold" was the title of a novel by García Márquez, that has now become a sad reality in the birthplace of the winner of the Nobel Prize for literature. The eight bullets that assassinated Yolanda Cerón, head of social care in Tumaco, were also foretold and once and for all destroyed the already precarious working conditions of human rights activists on the ground. For a year the paramilitaries have reigned in the town of Nariño. The government lets them do as they will and the list of the dead gets longer. Just before killing Yolanda, the paramilitaries publicly executed thirteen peasants in Teima. On Sunday morning, the former Culture Minister, who had previously been kidnapped, Consuelo Araujo Noguera, was murdered during a chase between the army and the guerrillas. Then, the day before yesterday, the paramilitaries assassinated Octavio Sarmiento, a Member of the National Congress. We know that anyone who defends human rights in Colombia is a target for the paramilitaries. A clean-up campaign was even announced in August. The government had already withdrawn the legal basis for the existence of the paramilitaries in 1989, but has never done anything to seriously dismantle them. On the contrary, the law on defence and national security, ratified by President Pastrana in August, made the situation even worse. The law, which is a real blank cheque for all sorts of violations of human rights, extends the army’s powers and freedom to act in a frightening way and reduces the power of the public prosecutor. The close links between the army and its illegal right arm, the paramilitaries, is well known and the "Human Rights Watch" report, published today, only serves to underline this. The European Union needs to question the bases of its cooperation with Colombia. We are still waiting for the first six-monthly report on the progress of human rights in Colombia promised one year ago. If the European Union takes defending human rights seriously, it should explain its criteria and mechanisms for evaluation and effective protection to us. If it takes the peace process seriously, it should encourage the pursuit of dialogue between the government and the guerrillas, categorically exclude the paramilitaries from the negotiations and support the report from the committee of experts, published on 28 September. Finally, if it takes its own commitment to legal reform seriously, the first thing the European Union must do is to support the widespread calls for the law on defence and national security to be repealed.

Mr President, the situation in Burma is disastrous. Hundreds of thousands of people are living, without any real humanitarian aid, packed into refugee camps in Thailand, China and Bangladesh. Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced into labour or displaced against their will. The political system is corrupt and repressive. The democratic opposition has been suppressed since it was elected on 27 May 1990, and more than 2000 people are in prison. Amnesty International condemns the institutionalised torture that takes place in these countries. All these human rights violations are crimes against humanity that need to be stopped and denounced in order to be definitively condemned. Who finances this regime besides the revenue obtained from the illegal sale of drugs? Well, there is TotalFinaElf, also present in Angola, Congo, Chad and Cameroon, and additionally found to be connected with the sinking of the Erika
 and in the accident in Toulouse. I think that this company, and this regime, should be boycotted. More than ever we need to support Burma’s democrats. The European Union should affirm that Aung San Suu Kyi is the only real chance for Burma and must take every possible measure as quickly as is possible to move this military dictatorship towards democratic transition.

 For years we have been warning about risks of accident. For years we have been afraid that a disaster would happen and for years we have fought against the establishment of these plants in the Toulouse area. And now, when the explosion occurs, we have the sudden shock that stunned us at a distance of twenty kilometres, the contradictory information, the toxic cloud, a prefect who is asking to have his house proofed for leaks, all the windows shattered, the reflex to go and pick one’s children up from school, the anguish of seeing cars upside down, windscreens shattered, bloodied drivers wearing masks, the joy of finding one’s daughters, terrified and sheltering in the only classrooms whose windows remain in tact, relieved to see us. Going home, unable to telephone, no means of communication and finally hearing about friends who are in shock, injured or in hospital. Then, after the anguish, the fear and after the suffering comes the time for anger. More than 5 000 of us gathered on the streets of Toulouse on Tuesday and more than 30 000 on Saturday, all shouting ‘Never again’. The disaster in Toulouse is hugely revealing. First of all, it shows the limitations of local democracy and, in particular, of land use planning policies. Town councils have not used their land use plans to keep residential or commercial areas away from danger. There is no safety programme in place. There has been no consultation with local associations or with residents, despite the dangers. Locally elected representatives are equally responsible for what has happened. The disaster also lays bare the policy of industrialists who, for the sake of profit, make not only their employees run risks, but also the surrounding community. Lastly, the disaster has shown up the loopholes in the Seveso directive and in the policies implemented by the European Union. This disaster has shown the limitations of risk management policy. An overhaul of European legislation is essential. We can no longer put up with the existence of such huge risks. We must have a risk prevention policy. The legal liability of industry in the event of an accident must be better defined and increased. Member States must transpose European Union directives, and also comply with existing directives on environmental protection. The liability of policymakers must also be confirmed. Inspections must be stepped up and the responsibility of inspectors, who must be trained to European standards, must also be laid down. Chemical as well as nuclear bombs are located near to most European cities and yet no assessment of the risks has been made. I do not want to play the role of Cassandra, but I would not wish anyone to experience what we in Toulouse went through on 21 September.

 Mr President, the abolition, in October 2000, of the main opposition party in Mauritania, the Union of Democratic Forces-New Era, and the arrest and subsequent sentencing, to five years’ imprisonment after a summary judgment, of the leader of the Popular Front, Chbih Melainine, calls into question the fundamental principles of democracy laid down in the constitution of Mauritania. What, then, is that constitution worth? There is no freedom of association for political parties. The Green Party, which submitted its articles of association several months ago, has still not been recognised and has not even received an acknowledgement that its application has been received. These anti-democratic manoeuvres are taking place on the eve of the legislative and local elections planned for October. We have no guarantee regarding these elections, because there is no independent electoral commission. In our opinion, the release of Chbih Melainine is a prerequisite for holding the elections in October, as is the reconstitution of all the opposition parties. It is in order to allow all these political actors to participate that we are asking that the elections should be postponed. In order to re-establish democracy and guarantee the organisation of free and fair elections in Mauritania, we are asking the Council and the Commission to enter into consultations with the government, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.

 Mr President, two years ago, my first speech to this House condemned the situation in Togo. Since then, although some good souls have assured us that everything is working out nicely, Togo is still living in a political wasteland and it has a long way to go before it escapes from it. Democracy is still a fleeting ideal. Civil rights and human rights are constantly flouted, and I believe that the passive attitude of the governments of European Union Member States does nothing to encourage things to change. Parliament’s regular condemnations are merely rhetorical and ineffective. Most recently, the sum paid by the Commission to organise new elections – CFA francs 4 billion – was dismissed as insufficient by the government, which took advantage of the opportunity to postpone, yet again, the long-awaited legislative elections. In a complete violation of his previous undertakings, President Eyadema and his government are even thinking about amending the constitution so as to allow him stand for election again. Finally, one of the opposition leaders, Mr Yawovi Agboyibo, was arrested and sentenced, a month ago, on trumped-up charges. The truth of the matter is that he had denounced the terror tactics employed in areas where the opposition had a majority, tactics which took the form of rapes and other crimes, including the murder of opponents. Mr Eyadema seems less than ever prepared to honour his obligations to his people and his obligations to the international community. Here again, Parliament should firmly condemn his actions, demand that free elections be held on the planned dates, and ask the Council and the Commission to initiate consultations in accordance with Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.

 Mr President, the attack on a train, which caused the death of 260 civilians and injured more than 150 people on 10 August in Angola is unacceptable and deplorable, especially since, in the weeks that followed, several buses also came under fatal attack. Once again, it was UNITA which struck the blow, thereby continuing to violate the peace agreement signed in Lusaka in 1994, which made provision, amongst other things, for the disarming of the militant rebels. Unfortunately, these acts of terrorism are merely one further stage in the civil war that has been ravaging the country for more than 25 years. Above all, however, these extremely violent acts against civilians only serve to postpone even further the prospect of organising the elections planned by the government for 2002–2003. When he announced, on 23 August, his intention not to stand in the presidential elections, President dos Santos threw the ball back into the rebels’ court. He says that he is prepared to hold free and democratic elections, provided that the war comes to an end. The pause in the fighting and the restoration of a peaceful climate are due, according to him, to Mr Savimbi and his militant movement. Yet Mr Savimbi, the leader of UNITA, says that he wants to negotiate. In reality, of course, sitting comfortably on his diamonds, he wants only one thing: all the power. We are also responsible here, because who is it who supplies UNITA with arms? Who is it who participates in this diamond trafficking? As for the government, it is not transparent either. The lack of transparency in the management of petroleum revenue leads us to conclude that public funds have been used to back up the regime. The Angolagate scandal has revealed the role of Europeans in this affair. The violence has to stop, and dialogue must be initiated as a matter of urgency. Angolans must vote for and achieve peace. The European Union can make its influence felt, and it has a role to play here. It should be reminded of that fact, and we must vote in favour of this resolution in order to go forward.

 Mr President, we have been waiting for a long time for a directive on blood quality, which is vital to ensure safety for donors and recipients at European level. From this point of view, Mr Nisticò’s report, which has been enhanced by various amendments adopted almost unanimously in committee, is a step towards improved human health protection, in particular because it calls for better medical checks on donors and also increases the responsibility of doctors and establishments dealing with blood at all stages, from collection through to storage and including the point at which blood is converted into blood derivates. As we have seen, there remains an important question on which there is no consensus between us: whether donation should be remunerated or not. We believe that the principle of non-remunerated blood donation is very important, a principle applied in many European countries without leading to shortages, and we cannot accept that this principle should be undermined, for two essential reasons. Firstly, from an ethical point of view, we cannot advocate the idea of selling blood or any body part. The human body is not a commodity. Furthermore, we find it extremely shocking that companies should be able to profit from blood donated without remuneration. Secondly, remunerating blood donation could be counter-productive in terms of quality. Donors attracted by a financial inventive may want to conceal possible health problems, which could have dramatic consequences for their own health and the health of the recipients. Recent information on the hundreds of thousands of Chinese now affected by AIDS because they have sold their plasma is a tragic illustration of this and we do not want the same situation to occur in Europe tomorrow.

 Mr President, the European Parliament should support the process of decentralising the Commission services so as to bring the European Union closer to its partners. We are therefore in favour of increasing the number of delegations and increasing their staff numbers in line with their increased responsibilities. However, cooperation on development should remain the priority of the delegations in developing countries, in particular as regards the planning of aid programmes. It is important that the representatives who negotiate on behalf of the Commission should be on the spot and in direct contact with the real situation. In order to do this they should develop relations with the local NGOs and with society in general, so that they can get to know and integrate the priority needs of communities, and not only those of governments in these indicative programmes. In addition to consultation, we must also increase the number of local agents in the delegations. It is vitally important that the delegation staff should have an extremely good knowledge of local conditions and should be able to speak regional languages, so as to maintain a permanent link with the various levels of the local community. In addition, the delegations must propose special training programmes for local experts so as to encourage their recruitment. Finally, it is urgently necessary to recruit staff who are qualified in social and environmental matters, which have so far been the poor relations of the aid and development programmes drawn up in Brussels.

 Mr President, earlier we voted in favour of the report by Mr Maaten on tobacco products, which contains some excellent measures. Now, we have exactly the same problem with alcohol; in other words, we are faced with approximately the same number of deaths, not only caused in road accidents, which is what we seem to focus on, but from cirrhosis of the liver, stomach cancer, throat cancer as well, and this is without including the various social problems. As in the case of tobacco products, we know that smoking a cigarette is no more dangerous than drinking a glass of wine. However, as in the case of tobacco products, we also know that drinking alcohol and adopting the habit of drinking begins at a young age, particularly because of the example shown by adults and the positive image it is given in advertisements. We should, in fact, adopt the same type of measures for alcohol as for tobacco products, and from this point of view, although the Commission report is good, it does not go nearly as far, perhaps because the alcohol lobbies are still more powerful than those for tobacco products, or perhaps because of our culture and customs. We should, in fact, bring in labelling for all alcoholic drinks to cover 30% of the product’s surface, indicating that alcohol kills, that alcohol is dangerous for health. We should ban advertising of alcohol, however implicit. We should ban sponsorship of all activities, particularly sporting activities, by manufacturers of alcoholic drinks. I shall not give a lecture but the truth of the matter is, as in the case of tobacco products, we will not make progress through clamping down on consumers – only through prevention. That is why we must immediately take action against everything that may incite young people to drink alcohol.

 So, the European Union is opening its borders to all products from the least developed countries, except arms, as if Mali or Bangladesh exported arms to Europe anyway. Everything but arms – but bananas, sugar and rice too, or, in other words, sensitive sectors for European countries but staple sectors for the LDCs. Furthermore, 40 of the 48 LDCs were already reaping the benefits of these preferences in the framework of the Lomé trade system. Therefore, their situation will not change in the slightest because of this measure. On the other hand, however, it is the non-LDCs that will feel the change, with the end of non-reciprocal trade preferences under the Cotonou Agreement and the creation of free trade areas by 2008. This measure will actually stimulate competition between the LDCs and non-LDCs, even within the same ACP group, which has not even been consulted. We are still taking the approach that only liberalisation and competition can lead to development. In return, as has already been mentioned, Mr Lamy is obviously expecting support from the LDCs at the negotiations in Qatar and, more broadly speaking, expecting them to join the WTO. On the face of it, these proposals appear to be favourable, but they risk confining the LDCs to the role of exporters of raw materials, at the expense even of the food requirements of their own populations.

 Mr President, in order to prevent conflicts we must know what causes them, be it economic interests, social unrest, inequality, a dictatorship, repression, the struggle for power or access to natural resources. Conversely, however, the escalation of conflicts in the countries of the South is a barrier to their prospects for development and creates a vicious circle. That being the case, the prevention of conflicts cannot be divorced from a policy of sustainable development aimed at a better distribution of wealth and the institution of real democracy at a global level. I listen to and I approve of the debates, including those held in this Parliament, that advocate dialogue, the participation of civil society, access to education and health for all, the rational use of resources and regional cooperation. We have to attack the structural costs of the tensions in advance. What is the point, then, of these declarations accompanied by derisory and diminishing budgets when European states sell arms to the countries at war or support petroleum and mining industries in their over-exploitation of the riches of the South to the detriment of human rights and life itself. As long as the concern for development does not override financial interests and as long as European states see external conflicts as a way of enriching themselves, the prevention of conflicts will remain a pipe dream.

 Mr President, the Cotonou Agreement establishes the parliamentary dimension of the Joint Assembly. This means that only democratically elected representatives, without exception, have the right to participate and to express their views within the Joint Parliamentary Assembly. But a single representative for each ACP country prevents opposition representatives from gaining access and expressing their views and hence obscures political pluralist expression in these countries. Moreover, the principle of one vote for each country in the ACP group as opposed to one vote for each person on the European side is not a fair one. The very structure of this Assembly is therefore unbalanced. The European Parliament is an institution in its own right. The ACP group does not have an existence outside its appearance at the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and does not have an organisation in the form of political groups. Secondly, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly has taken on a new role, but decision-making powers are not everything. It does not have the right to use European Development Funds; it does not participate in the procedure to ratify the Cotonou Agreement. We will therefore vote for the report by Mr Martínez Martínez with conviction because it highlights these shortcomings. But the Assembly must continue to reflect on its composition, its function and its powers so that, in 2001, it can become a joint, fair Parliamentary Assembly.

 Mr President, Community development policy must make it possible to establish a framework for discussion with the European Union’s partners, to coordinate European action with other donors, particularly the Member States and to increase consistency with other Community policies, especially commercial policy and common agricultural policy. The Commission’s current approach, however, will not give rise to a fair policy because it is still dependent on the market’s operation and the rules specified by the WTO, the IMF and the World Bank, which are still unfavourable for developing countries. Liberal globalisation to promote development has admittedly been a failure. Mr Gemelli’s report quite rightly denounces the deterioration in the economic, social and environmental situation of developing countries, the worsening of poverty and the negative impact of globalisation on these countries. It advocates a review of the WTO rules so that account is taken of developing countries. We should reiterate, however, the basic principle of a sustainable development policy. The beneficiaries of the aid should set out their development strategy themselves, with their own needs in mind. Here, however, we have exactly the reverse – the European Union gives itself the right to dictate to its partners how to use the aid in the six areas that it considers to be priorities. We must take away this fundamental ambiguity. Are we acting in the interests of the countries that we apparently want to help, or in the interests of the European Union and its Member States? Where does the European Union stop having a direct interest and where does its development policy begin? Developing countries are obviously experiencing difficulties in protecting their interests within the international community. For example, in terms of health care, a court case was brought against South Africa by pharmaceutical multinationals. Brazil was condemned by the United States because it manufactured or imported cheap generic drugs for combating AIDS, a disease which is killing millions of Brazilians. The European Community must make its voice heard in the international courts in order to defend the principle of potentially granting free licences to developing countries that have pressing health care problems. I am asking my fellow Members to do this by adopting an amendment that has, moreover, already been adopted by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly. The continued reduction of the Community budget for development, which is 1.1% smaller in the draft budget for 2002, is also incomprehensible, whereas development cooperation is one of the priorities of the Commission’s Work Programme for 2001. There is a long list of deviations from the development policy that the Commission has, up to now, been conducting. We shall therefore vote in favour of this report, since it highlights the gulf between political statements and the progress that has actually been made, even if it does not always follow our logic to the letter.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, exactly which Plan Colombia are we discussing here? Is it the first version which was sent straight to us, in English, from the United States before being submitted to the Colombian Congress or the second version, intended for Europe, which stresses the social aspect but certainly does nothing to conceal the basically military nature of the plan. This programme of aid to the Colombian Government aims to combat drug production and trafficking. How is it going to do this? By providing the Colombian Government with weapons. This military equipment is apparently going to be used to destroy cocaine plantations. You will forgive me if I am somewhat dubious about the use of these weapons in a country which, since 1948, has been devastated by a war sparked off by socio-economic reasons that are valid today, but which is increasingly becoming a war between the military-paramilitary alliance and the people. Exactly who does Plan Colombia see as the opposing forces? Officially, it is the Colombian State combating drug traffickers. In reality, the drug barons are protected by paramilitary groups, who are in turn trained by the Colombian army. These are the groups that are killing peasant farmers, the coca growers, and driving out the people living in areas valued highly by the oil companies. That is without even mentioning the pressure exerted on the supporters of the ‘Nunca Màs
’ project who are fighting to keep the memory of these atrocities alive. On the pretext of combating drugs, a war is being waged against the civilian population,. This plan provides direct support to the murderers, by which I mean the paramilitary groups, that have already killed over 150 people since the start of the year and whose close links with the army are obvious. Moreover, on no account can the European Union sanction the lack of democracy or legitimacy evident at the signing of this agreement between the American and Colombian Governments. The European Union and the Member States should not cooperate with this plan; they should oppose it, as do the NGOs and local social movements. There is no question of sharing the responsibility with America. Responsibility for what? Millions of deaths? Can we accept Plan Colombia? I support the view of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. We shall, therefore, vote in favour of this resolution which, far from recommending arms donations, proposes quite the opposite approach, i.e. to encourage scaling down armed conflict, to fight the association of the military and paramilitary groups, to show respect for those working in defence of human rights and to improve the living conditions of the population in conjunction with social movements, rather than against them. Holding talks is the way to achieve peace, not waging war.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 80 fatalities in Europe from new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Europe, its Council of Ministers, the Commission and Parliament decide to ban meat-and-bone meal and exclude cattle over 30 months’ old from the food chain without prior testing. Better late than never. Fifty thousand deaths a year for decades, due to the consequences of using a drug with known side-effects for which doctors and hospital departments know there is only palliative treatment, and nothing is done apart from a few timid information campaigns. Then, when a directive does come along seeking to regulate the distribution of that drug and information about it – I am talking about tobacco – there is an outcry from some Members. But ladies and gentlemen, if you truly acknowledged the health problems linked to tobacco, you would demand a ban on this drug, just as you continue to maintain the bans on other substances despite the fact that, quantitatively, they are far less lethal. You are responsible for the health of millions of citizens, and also for the deaths of thousands of young people who have not been given sufficient information. Cases have recently been won in the United States against the tobacco multinationals for poisoning people and lying about the toxicity of their products. Now, in France, the Loire-Atlantique health insurance company has won the right to sue the tobacco industry in the courts. But in the future, just as with contaminated blood and mad cow disease, legal action will be taken against those who knew about it and let it happen, and that means you, us, the decision makers, the legislators. So let us do something together, just a small thing in view of how much remains to be done. Let us reduce the levels of nicotine and tar; ban addictive substances, like ammonia which is added to the nicotine to increase addiction to cigarettes; attach legible warnings covering at least 35% of the cigarette packet to alert people to the risks and dangers of tobacco; get rid of lies like ‘light’ and ‘ultra-light’ which encourage young people, especially young women, to smoke in the belief that this makes it less harmful, when medical science now agrees that the upsurge in peripheral small-cell lung cancers which are more insidious, more difficult to diagnose and have even more tragic prognoses is linked to over-consumption of this type of cigarette; evaluate the socio-economic cost of tobacco and transform the subsidies to tobacco producers into real redevelopment subsidies benefiting, for example, the production of cereals to replace meat-and-bone meal; recognise that products intended for export should comply with the same regulations as those intended for the internal European market; raise the price of tobacco because that is a measure which has a direct incidence on consumption, especially by young people; and harmonise tax rates. None of this amounts to a great deal, ladies and gentlemen, and it will not really damage the interests of the tobacco industry, which some people would apparently rather protect than public health. Much more needs to be done. In fact, this directive should be extended to products other than cigarettes, like cigars and rolling tobacco, which are no less harmful. The ban on advertising these lethal products should be confirmed, and the collective rules on no-smoking areas should be extended. We have a lot of work to do. I urge you to adopt Mr Maaten’s report as a first step in the interests of the health of future generations.

 Madam President, let me say right away that we shall be voting in favour of the Trakatellis report, but, once again, we see dysfunction in the European Union, because we are urgently adopting a link between two programmes, as if it were a surprise that programmes supposed to end in the year 2000, actually do end in the year 2000. I agree with Mr Trakatellis: you cannot play games with patients’ health when they expect our help, or with non-governmental organisations which need these Community budgets to deliver the health policies on the ground. In general, it is high time the Member States agreed to give the European Union a greater margin of manoeuvre and a more substantial budget, on a legitimately supranational issue: diseases know no frontiers. Above all, a framework programme should not forget the specific actions on the pretext of refocusing. For example, even if the fight against AIDS is not fashionable, it still needs to be a priority because this tragic disease remains very present, particularly in the future candidate countries. In conclusion, we hold that the goal of a future European strategy must be the incorporation of health issues into all the other Community policies, so as to put an end to current anomalies, like allocating 50 million euros to the fight against cancer while subsidising the tobacco industry to the tune of one billion!

 Madam President, I am not going to repeat what has already been said, and said very well, and with very laudable intentions. Rather, I am going to try to talk about facts. I think the facts, today, are simple. The facts are access to treatment and patient care. UNAIDS itself acknowledges the ineffectiveness of the programme announced by the pharmaceutical laboratories, which were only trying to improve their image, in fact, and are now withdrawing when it comes to genuine negotiation of a reduction in the price of treatment. The issue is no longer donations of medication, necessarily limited in time and subject to the selective interests of the laboratories, but adapting treatment price to purchasing power in the developing countries. The European Union must urge the pharmaceutical multinationals to grant voluntary licences, a first step towards access to treatment for the deprived populations. If that is not done, the European Union should impose respect for the agreements in case of medical emergency, and require the granting of compulsory licences, which would finally mitigate the problem of the price of treatment. I think the agony of a whole continent takes precedence over special interests.

 Mr President, the proposed ECIP development programme provides a pretty picture of the European Commission’s mismanagement. Although this programme is heading in the right direction, i.e. technology transfer to developing countries, the Commission has, perhaps unwittingly, applied a brake. The programme has been running for twelve years and the Commission has waited right until it is about to end before considering whether to carry on with it. As with other programmes, the Commission has not looked into the consequences of a possible end to this programme, the implications for the continuity of actions already undertaken or for the situation affecting partner businesses and jobs. It appears that, last year, the EUR 90 million that were budgeted for this programme were not even used, due to a lack of human resources available to study the dossiers, which are piled up on a desk somewhere in Brussels. At the same time, the administrative procedures have become more cumbersome with every passing year, yet the personnel running the programme have not seen any increase in their staffing numbers. Similarly, business partners were not informed of the possible termination of the programme. Lastly, the criteria for the distribution of funds between the different foci of the programme, particularly the social rights of workers, have remained impenetrably vague. In light of what I have just said, we ask the Commission to look into the means, firstly, of producing a rapid evaluation of the assessment and, secondly, of re-establishing the programme whilst improving its transparency and maintaining the level of its budget.

 Mr President, throughout the world, development aid is giving way to humanitarian aid. Even here, the Directorate-General for External Relations is gradually taking charge of the areas that were formerly the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Development, with humanitarian aid compensating for the failures of external policy. It is not just a question of providing aid, but also of restoring balance in the use of natural resources among all of the world’s inhabitants. Unfortunately, humanitarian aid cannot play this role and must not serve only to bail out a liberal policy which at the same time murders the populations of the countries in receipt of aid. Sustainable development is all but absent from the European Union’s humanitarian policy – we are quite unprepared for natural disasters and do little to prevent conflicts. Systematic training in how to deal with earthquakes and floods as well as in preventing violence would be welcome in many parts of the world. Instead of this, the European Union always reacts too late – once the disaster has been declared. This lack of planning can be seen in the programmes of aid for health and nutrition, and gender issues are also ignored. The connection between humanitarian and development policy, although crucial, is systematically missing. It is important not to do just what is strictly necessary, but to prevent the effects of these catastrophes, and first of all, the factor that makes them worse, which is poverty. We hope that cross-sector posts will be created in order to link ECHO and the Directorate-General for Development. These could also initiate cooperation with other worldwide organisations in the field of humanitarian aid, beginning with those in Member States, since there is a considerable lack of coordination in their actions. It is equally important that operating and assessment costs do not exceed 20% of ECHO’s budget. Payments must also be made more rapidly. Venezuela has been waiting since last December for the aid it was promised. Even if we are satisfied overall with the European Union’s humanitarian policy, and if we are generally happy with Mr Imbeni’s report, this policy must, to a greater extent, be in keeping with sustainable development.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that the Pacific always evokes images of paradise: beaches, coconut palms, sun. Today, the reality is far sadder. The two coups d’état that have taken place in Fiji recently in fact show unstable States divided by poverty. The most incredible thing in this matter, apart from the passivity of our institutions, is that the pretext of interethnic tension is always used to explain such conflicts. We are well aware, however, that the true cause is not just that. In the Solomon Islands, the vast majority of the population is Melanesian and Christian. In Fiji, almost half the population is of Indian origin, but these origins date back to the last century. Moreover, in spite of these differences, all these people are at home in Fiji. I believe there are causes other than this ethnic conflict. For example, we deny the role played by those who make a profit from these conflicts: multinationals and local politicians. For the former, periods of instability mean fewer social, tax and environmental obligations as the State is very weak in these cases and conflicts favour the arms industry as the political groups need to get their weapons from somewhere. As far as politicians are concerned, the practice of pitting one group against another, as, for example, the far right does in Europe, allows a political vacuum to be created or power to be maintained. This practice is only possible because the population is poor and suffers from a lack of knowledge of other groups. In this case, the two conflicts should have enabled some people to take back or gain power that they could not win through the ballot box. In Fiji, the coup d’état was fomented by a bankrupt businessman who used his distant Fiji origins to legitimise his actions. As for the new Prime Minister, he is also from a business background. In the Solomon Islands, a sham parliamentary vote brought a new Prime Minister to power, elected by the power of the gun. These two examples support our vision of the conflict. The joint resolution, however, is too sanctimonious and effectively wants to restore the previous situation. As is all too often the case, it does not refer to the true sources of these conflicts: poverty and the underlying self-interested role of political and economic participants. From this point of view, if we want to be really effective, we must prevent further conflicts and to do so, we must genuinely aid the development of education, the local economy and local democracy. This is how we might succeed in changing things.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is just one figure to remember and keep in mind throughout the debate and, particularly, during the voting: 500 000 deaths per annum within the European Community are due to tobacco, which is to say, more than AIDS, tuberculosis or other infectious diseases. And if we were to issue a directive on the social costs or on public health, then it would have to be a discussion about simply banning this fatal poison outright. This is not, however, the case. Here we are presented with a directive intended to facilitate the free movement of goods throughout the European Union by approximating Member State laws, regulations and administrative provisions on the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products. We must therefore concern ourselves not with prohibition but with establishing the same conditions for consumer information throughout all of the European Union regarding the content but also the potential risks they run in consuming these products. In particular we must give thought to young people who do not have the necessary objectivity, and have only the image of young men and women smokers, and not the viewpoint that I was able to gain as a doctor on a respiratory medicine or cancer ward where I saw smokers dying in great pain from lung cancer. This is not the future we want for our own children. Let us also give a thought to other people’s future. From this point of view, we must be pleased with Mr Maaten’s report and the amendments voted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which improve the proposed directive. All these provisions, however, still fall short of what is necessary in the way of consumer information, and too often the determination to reach a compromise has prevailed. We must not let the text be distorted by amendments direct from the headquarters of the tobacco industry. We must remain vigilant as to the content, size and presentation of these warnings, which must not be changed. Several contentious issues still remain. The labelling of tobacco products other than cigarettes must be subject to the same conditions. The difficulty of measuring values or the fact that these products are not targeted at young people must not be used as an excuse for forgetting that these products, such as cigars, rolling tobacco or snuff, are harmful and must be labelled as such, especially since some, like the cigar or the pipe, may occasionally prove more attractive to young people. The maximum tar content of 10 mg is still excessive and does not take into consideration the real amount actually inhaled and the habits acquired. Tar content must be limited still further. More worrying is the fact that the Technical Committee set up includes specialists from the tobacco industry. How is this body supposed to be neutral when it includes so-called experts that have spent their time deceiving public opinion, now supposed to become impartial judges of the harmfulness and toxicity of the products sold by their own employers? I feel that one would have to be extremely naive, and not, one hopes, just corrupt, to believe that such a body might be truly objective. Especially since these consultants to the industry are prepared to allow the introduction of ingredients not only to increase consumption but also to increase habituation. In conclusion, confronted with 500 000 deaths annually, confronted with the money spent by the tobacco lobbies, infiltrating even this House, we must, ladies and gentlemen, make a choice in favour of life.

 Mr President, once again the drama unfolding in an African country is bringing Parliament face to face with the daily horrors of a bloody conflict and civil war. Certain kind souls are already pointing the finger at misgovernance and ethnic causes and indicating the culprits who should be eliminated. As with the oil of Congo-Brazzaville, Angola or Nigeria and the mineral resources of Chad, Niger or the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and as in the latter generally or in Angola, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the causes are indeed economic and the fight for control of the diamond-producing areas is the basis and reason for this continuing conflict. We are right to condemn the Revolutionary United Front or RUF for unilaterally resuming hostilities and for involving thousands of child-soldiers in the horror. However, the Sierra Leone army and its militias should also come in for criticism. We are right to condemn the use of diamonds by the RUF for war purposes. But what are the economic interests behind the government’s actions? We are right to condemn Liberia and Burkina Faso for their involvement in the arms trade and the recycling of diamonds. But who is selling arms to these countries and who is buying the diamonds? We are right to send in a UN Implementation Force and to want to disarm those who are fighting. Yet without proper distribution of the wealth of these countries, as in other African countries, and if we continue to allow mining and oil companies to pillage these countries and to fund the groups controlling these resources, our intervention will once again be in vain as it will not tackle the real causes.

 Mr President, hearing the other speakers, I note that we all agree on the facts. The harsh and tragic figures are there for all to see. The 50 poorest countries spend twice what they receive in aid in order to pay off their debt. An average of 40% of the budget of poor countries is dedicated to debt payments. Not only does that undermine their economic development, not only does that significantly reduce their ability to provide basic social services, such as health or education, but it creates a sort of slavery which benefits Western societies. In fact two thirds of the debt is generated by interest on earlier loans, loans taken out to pay for the things we sold them, which multinationals sold them. This is highly reminiscent of the exploitation of agricultural workers in some countries who are forced to buy from the boss’s shop at inflated prices and who are then forced to work for the rest of their lives for scant wages in order to pay off their debts to this shop. What action are we taking to prevent this? The G7 countries announced amid much publicity a debt reduction programme, but conditions are such that it cannot be applied. This initiative remains subject to macroeconomic reform programmes under the aegis of the IMF or the World Bank, which run counter to the objectives of eradicating poverty, due to their restrictive effect on the ability to spend on social services and job creation. Some major countries have announced that they are going to cancel debts, but this is selective, linked to the interests of certain parties, and is achieved to the detriment of development budgets. The indebted countries were expecting a strong message from the Conference between the European Union and Africa held in Cairo recently. They were given plenty of fine words, but no practical action. What initiatives do the Commission and the Council propose to take at European or international level in order to further relieve or cancel the burden of debt in order to aid the poorest countries? How does the Commission plan to ensure that the appropriations made available by cancelling the debt are properly invested in eradicating poverty and in sustainable development? Finally, what is the Commission’s reaction to the requests presented by some civil society organisations in the countries of the south for improvements in monitoring the macroeconomic adaptation plan, by organising conferences on national development, in order to give public opinion in these countries an opportunity to define national priorities and projects?
Rod (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Cairo Summit gave rise to great expectation among African countries, particularly among those which hoped to see their debt cancelled. Europe’s response to this was to say that it was too great a call upon its own resources to move towards the complete cancellation of the debt. On the contrary, we affirm the political need to restore balance in the relations between African and the European Union. After having plundered the natural resources of Africa very widely, and in fact continuing to do so, we must cancel our historical debt to them by cancelling their current debt to our banks. This would enable us to pursue relations on a sounder basis. And the Members of the European Union must stop lying. We are asking African countries to respect democratic principles, but we are perpetuating antidemocratic practices in order to guarantee our own financial interests, in the style of Elf or Total, in a number of countries. We order African countries to guarantee the plurality of political parties and allow the NGOs freedom of expression, but we negotiate only with Heads of States, the majority of whom represent only themselves, forgetting to invite the NGOs to the Cairo Summit. We are asking African countries to accord women a larger place in society, but we ought to begin by establishing parity in our own countries. Need I remind you that some European Union countries have less than 10% of women members in their national parliaments? We expect the African countries to observe cease-fires, but we are fanning the flames of conflict with our arms exports to belligerents. But none of this is the key issue. As long as the European Union does not provide itself with the resources to ensure that the agreements for the granting of mandatory licences for the production of medicines to combat the AIDS pandemic are applied, expecting any progress in the African economy will remain in the realms of the pious hope. For how can one expect a country in which a quarter of its young people are dying from AIDS every year to have a booming economy? Once again, as we have already said, the European Union and the Member States must make their actions consistent with their statements. For, while we are hesitating, while we are shilly-shallying, while we are discussing, Africa is dying.

Mr President, while much progress remains to be made, it is true that the European Union has always pursued a policy of cooperation and development in respect of developing countries, and I believe that the environmental dimension must be incorporated into this policy and expanded upon. Indeed, the notion of sustainable development takes on real meaning in such countries, and more particularly in the very poorest of them, since these are the countries which most often experience large-scale disasters, including the natural disasters which have recently become increasingly common. Much has indeed been said of pollution and the effects of pollution, but this proliferation of natural disasters was evident in Central America and Venezuela at the end of last year, and can now be seen in Mozambique and Madagascar. These disasters are in fact the result of extreme climatic changes with which we should be quite familiar, since they are precipitated by human activities, notably those of developed countries. The greenhouse effect and deforestation also have a considerable impact. As regards this regulation on the environmental dimension in the development process in developing countries, the Council has broadly taken up the amendments that we presented and voted upon at first reading. From this perspective we cannot fail to be satisfied. I would nevertheless like to stress one point that the Council has overlooked – inadvertently, I believe and hope – but which is absolutely fundamental: coordination between European operators and local partners, which is to say local NGOs, grass-roots communities and people with a time-honoured understanding of how to harness biological diversity. No programme can be truly effective unless it is conducted in close collaboration with the communities concerned. One last point: should we be successful in setting up steering committees, I believe it would be necessary to re-emphasise the importance of establishing a complaint procedure which is open to civil society in developing countries with regard to measures that run counter to legitimate concerns in the field of social welfare.

Mr President, let us be clear from the outset: when it comes to cooperation, coherence is far from being the watchword. The Treaties provide for the European Union to help developing countries to develop but, as the previous speakers have explained so well, there are various distortions to these declarations. The first area of incoherence is the lack of consultation between the Union and the Member States on individual cooperation policies. This gives rise to serious malfunctions, because some Community programmes duplicate national programmes, whereas they might have helped other projects about which nothing is done. And let us not forget that the de facto neo-colonial policy of certain Member States does nothing to help the countries which they are supposedly helping to develop. The second area of incoherence is aid to authoritarian regimes. We state that good governance and an end to corruption are mandatory but we continue to pour hundreds of thousands of euros into Swiss bank accounts via the portfolios of a number of Heads of State. The third area of incoherence is human rights. We say that we want to protect human rights. We encourage developing countries to respect human rights. We even adopt numerous resolutions condemning every violation of human rights. We ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns. And yet, at the same time, we allow the arms trade to proliferate and do not even attempt to limit the trade in the most atrocious forms of arms such as anti-personnel mines. Nor do we do much to really prevent human rights violations. The fourth area of incoherence in the European Union’s cooperation policy is this: how do you expect to help development by pillaging the natural resources of the people you are helping. The European Union must leave fish for local fishermen to feed local populations instead of systematically destroying maritime resources through intensive fisheries. We must leave raw materials so that local manufacturers can process them. I will not even mention oil; we are all aware of the policy of groups such as Elf and Total in Africa. Furthermore, and this will perhaps soon be the fifth area of incoherence, we demand respect for biodiversity, for example so that everyone can produce from their own seeds and preserve the richness of nature; but at the same time, and this was apparent during recent negotiations, we force ACP countries to sign TRIPS agreements. These agreements risk being extended to living organisms, which would mean the death of biodiversity and the return of de facto slavery for small-scale farmers in the south, at the hands of the multinationals. And yet, and this is the sixth area of incoherence, we do not defend the application of the current Treaties. On the one hand, we vote for a budget line for the fight against AIDS and, on the other hand, we do nothing to ensure compliance with mandatory licences within the framework of the very same TRIPS, despite the fact that this would allow developing countries to produce their own medicines and halt the AIDS massacre. Similarly, during the WTO negotiations, at a time when, to quote the second paragraph of the Schwaiger report, “the current trade liberalisation process has not yet brought significant benefits for large parts of the population of developing countries, especially the poor”, the European Union continues to defend the liberalisation of trade and intends to put an end to the system of favouring ACP countries, albeit with a transitional period of several years, instead of strengthening it, especially for the poorest countries. The eighth area of incoherence is of a political and practical nature. We are always saying think globally, act locally. And yet we disregard local development agencies and prefer to negotiate with national governments and subsidise northern NGOs at the expense of local programmes and southern NGOs. And what about agriculture and the environment? Still more problems, still more areas of incoherence which I might have highlighted, not to mention research, emigration or health. In short, we claim that we want to help developing countries and, at the same time, we encourage the liberalisation of trade, which we acknowledge runs counter to that very objective. I say it again, the European Union’s cooperation and development policy is not coherent. and on behalf of the Green Group I call on Parliament, the institutions and the Commission to make a joint effort, at long last, to put some coherence into our policy.

 Mr President, the Grossetête report on orphan medicinal products responds to an important requirement. It is to be congratulated for providing an immediate although imperfect solution to this problem. The absence of proper research into these supposedly rare diseases is prejudicial to thousands of patients. However, this report has several shortcomings. Firstly, it takes into account only private research and research carried out by the pharmaceutical industry, as if only these were capable of finding therapies to research medicinal products. No support is given to public research or to non-profit-making bodies which may also be capable of finding therapies. The second and most important shortcoming is that, although mentioned in the preamble, the text does not provide a solution for one vital problem. This involves research into diseases which are common but for which there is no market for the pharmaceutical industry, in particular diseases affecting people who cannot pay for their treatment. This is particularly the case with tropical diseases and even malaria and tuberculosis. No incentives for research into these diseases and no regulations are suggested which is astounding in view of the millions of deaths caused by these diseases. Parliament and the Commission must consider this issue in the coming months because the lives of millions of people are just as important as the profit of a few businesses.

 Mr President, once again we are called upon to discuss the situation in Rwanda. Yesterday we were deploring genocide and violations of human rights. Today, indeed, we can only be outraged at the release of Jean Bosco Barayagwiza, supposedly for technical reasons, even though he was one of the most significant parties in the incitement to genocide. His release, indeed, is quite symptomatic of the lack of will to make an evaluation of the genocide and, more especially, of the wish to hush up the involvement of European countries, particularly France, where a recent parliamentary inquiry revealed complicity that was, at the best, passive. Let us also stress that the Rwandan situation, as worrying as it is, more particularly affects the stability of neighbouring countries, and the situation in the Congo is quite tragic from this point of view. It is essential today for the European Parliament to assert clearly that, in order to ensure stability in this region, the conditions must be created for a peace which is based on justice and the prosecution of those responsible for ethnic violence. This is why we are asking the ICTR to review its position regarding Mr Barayagwiza’s release, in consideration of the seriousness of the charges against him. Without some action of this sort, the populations of Rwanda are likely to feel they have been wronged and ethnic conflict is likely to start up again with renewed vigour. We also ask the Rwandan government to resume its relations with the ICTR. This is why it is essential to put an end to the conditions of impunity which are prevailing in these countries.

 Mr President, we approach the draft budget 2000 with considerable concern, particularly regarding the lines on development and cooperation but also those concerning human rights, as other Members have already said. Indeed, we have the impression that this budget is restricting all those things which are dearest to us. At a time when the requirement is for women to take greater part in the decision-making process, the corresponding budget lines are being restricted. At a time when the wish is for the environment, particularly the protection of tropical forests, to be integrated into the development process, the appropriations allocated to this are being reduced. At a time when developing countries are being asked to respect the principle of good government, with respect for human rights, our own budget on this crucial issue is being drastically reduced. Finally, at the very time when Lusaka is reminding us of the human and economic ravages due to AIDS in Africa, we are reducing the funds dedicated to it, contrary to the Commissioner Nielson’s assertions, while mixing them in with the policy on health and reproduction. Furthermore, we can only regret the re-orientation which involves favouring aid to States rather than to NGOs, especially the organisations of the South which are, however, known to be more effective and which make it possible to really target society. In short, we cannot be satisfied with this new distribution of appropriations which destabilises the priorities of the European Union in developing countries.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of the fight against AIDS in developing countries has been discussed many times in the European Parliament. Yet, since 1996, the situation has further deteriorated – 89% of the people afflicted with AIDS are resident in the 10% of the poorest countries on Earth. This is clear evidence of the failure of a policy dedicated purely to limiting the illness without looking into the economic and social reasons for the spread of the disease. On the one hand, the economy of African countries is crumbling due to the structural adjustments made necessary by the World Bank and the IMF. States are making swingeing cuts in their social budgets, resulting in an inability to provide patients with minimum care. The European Union must assist these countries in providing this minimum care, and more, if possible. Indeed, we were stupefied to learn that, against the advice of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, the AIDS budget was to be halved, which would be a scandal, given the urgency of the situation, and contradictory to the comments made by Mr Nielson. In the majority of African countries, there is no access to screening and, even if it were accessible, surely it is understandable that no one wishes to find out their status when discovering that you are HIV positive means that all you can do is wait to die. The fact is, treatment is practically non-existent in most of these countries. Confronted with this situation, the Lusaka conference maintained an often inappropriate line, promoting abstinence, moral order and traditional medicine. AIDS cannot be fought by ignoring the provision of medical treatment. Thus, the States most affected by the disease ought to be able to benefit from compulsory licences permitting them to produce, at reduced cost, the generic anti-HIV treatments effective in preventing the development of the opportunistic infections which lead unavoidably to death. Today, this right is not applied due to pressure from holders of patents, from States or multinationals. Within the scope of the precautionary principle in health matters, the European Union must therefore defend the application of the entitlement to compulsory licences in the Millennium Round Millions of people dead, millions of orphaned children, we cannot stand by and do nothing. This is why, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I ask you to support our proposals, so that we can give developing countries some real means of combating this scourge which is AIDS.

 The situation in Togo is not new. Indeed, since General Eyadema seized power, there have been constant violations of human rights: executions, cases of torture and arrests. After the electoral fraud last year which allowed General Eyadema to hold on to power, we are right to be worried about the democratic intentions of this regime. The absence of an independent electoral commission, the absence of fair access to the media, the absence of any guarantee of the right to campaign, have all led the opposition, which is in the majority, to boycott next spring’s legislative elections. Even if we take the agreement recently signed with the opposition to be a step forward, it is still inadequate, and risks being a meaningless scrap of paper unless it provides a number of guarantees. We must bring an immediate end to the impunity enjoyed by those who commit such abuses, and we must also ensure that the authorities do in fact respect human rights. The parliament must not only be dissolved, but we must also demand Mr Eyadema’s resignation, before the end of his term of office, so that genuinely free and fair elections can be organised.  These conditions must be met if the European Union is to resume co-operation with Togo.

 Thank you, Commissioner. I see that our rapporteur is requesting the floor, so we shall listen to him.

 Ladies and gentlemen, given what time it is and the state of the debate, we should be here all night, without anyone succeeding in convincing anyone else in this Assembly, if I were to give the floor to all the MEPs requesting it.

 Mr President, Commissioner, my fellow Member has just said that she really does not want us in future to have to add our tears to the waters that regularly devastate our regions. Unfortunately, I am much less optimistic than she is. Much less optimistic because I know very well that you were making a wish, Mrs Grossetête. However, wishes are not enough when we see the climate change that is taking place on our planet. I was in my region of Languedoc a few days ago and people told me that what we are seeing now did not used to happen once in a hundred years. We have now seen it three times in two years. It is therefore clear to see that there is a change of frequency, magnitude and scale. I am always surprised to see the authorities, not just in my country, that would be too easy, but in all the countries affected, running a little bit behind the disaster. This summer, in the regions that were affected in south eastern France, the locals were already piling up sandbags. How was it that the local people knew, but the authorities did not act until disaster happened? There is clearly a gap between those who are on the ground and suffer the destruction and the decision makers, who are obviously still far away from it. With heat waves, storms and sudden floods, the climate is changing. I do not have the impression that public policies are changing at the same rate. I think a whole arsenal of measures need to be taken to deal with it, taxation in particular. How many times have we, the Greens and regionalists, said in this House that the tax weapon really should be used to change behaviour that poses a threat to the climate? And we are still waiting for that tax on pollution, that tax on discharges that change the atmosphere of our planet and which, in the end, are destroying entire regions. Aids are in the process of changing. I do understand, Commissioner, that we have indeed little by little, disaster after disaster, deployed finance for repairs and prevention. Repairs are good, prevention is better, my fellow Members have said. However, and I agree with them entirely on this point, prevention is inconceivable without a far-reaching reform of the Structural Funds. So long as there is zoning it will be ineffective. You must understand that storms and floods often care nothing for the zones we have so cleverly drawn on a map far away in Brussels or elsewhere. So these funds definitely need to be reformed and perhaps all those Structural Funds that do not find any use on the ground but are paid back into Community and then national budgets could be better employed in prevention to meet this climate change. In conclusion, I was saying that these problems have obviously changed in frequency and scale. Even if European public policies are changing, which I note and welcome, I do not have the impression that they are changing at the same speed and to the same extent, and I regret that.
President.  
– Thank, you, Commissioner. The joint debate is closed, and we will proceed to the vote.(1)
President.  
– The House has completed its business. I declare suspended this session of the European Parliament, wishing you all a splendid holiday, in order to restore your energies ready to complete the fifth parliamentary term in 2004.

I believe, Mr Mulder, that the applause coming from all sides of the Chamber is ample display of this House’s gratitude to you for your work. The debate is closed. The vote on this important dossier will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m. *** Thus concludes our budget debate. The sitting is adjourned until 5.30 p.m, when it will resume with questions to the Council. (The sitting, adjourned at 4.56 p.m, resumed at 5.30 p.m)
President. 
 – Pursuant to the rules of procedure I will ask if anyone wishes to speak in favour of this request for a report and if anyone wishes to speak against.
President. 
 – I am sorry, Mr Mayol i Raynal, but the rules of procedure are very strict: your request should be made to the College of Quaestors and not to the House. If you have information to present to the House then you have time slots for that at the beginning of the sitting. I cannot interrupt the vote for an explanation of this kind. I hope that you will forgive me.

President. 
 – Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to inform you that, in the context of inter-parliamentary relations, the Knesset Delegation for relations with the European Parliament, lead by its chairperson, Mrs Blumenthal, is visiting the European Parliament. (Applause)
 In wishing Mrs Blumenthal and the members of her delegation a warm welcome, I would like to stress the importance that we attach to such a visit, in particular, given the current situation. The tragic events with which the Israeli and Palestinian people are faced on a daily basis, make the resumption of dialogue between these two parties – a dialogue that the European Parliament has always encouraged – more necessary than ever. This is why, and without wanting to go into detail about the conflict that has been affecting your region for too long, I hope that the meetings that you will have with Members of the European Parliament will be fruitful and that they will be able to contribute to better reciprocal information, so as to better bring about conditions, in which just and sustainable peace will finally be able to put an end to this interminable conflict that affects your region and which, day after day, causes the deaths of too many innocent victims amongst the Israeli and Palestinian populations. (Applause)
 (Addressing Mr Cappato, who requested the floor

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the Book of Revelation the number of the beast is 666. The equivalent in our draft Constitution is 473, that is Section 4, Article 7, paragraph 3. This is the revision clause. It could be termed the ‘in perpetuity clause’ as henceforth double unanimity will be needed to dot any I or cross any T. I refer to unanimity at the IGC and at the level of ratification. One might as well say that this is impossibility set in stone. I would also like to highlight that no consensus has been reached on this article, as it was not debated in depth in plenary at the Convention, given the time pressure of the last few days. The question arises as to whether this Convention text is a treaty or a constitution. The terms of a treaty can be amended if there is the unanimous agreement of the contracting parties. The terms of a constitution can be amended by a qualified or overqualified majority. Constitutions are never amended by unanimity, however. If the aim is to create a constitution, an adjustment is certainly called for. A new clause will be needed to facilitate progress. This could be some kind of enabling clause, for example. The draft Constitution already has many such clauses. The report itself is extremely weak on this point. Even so, our rapporteurs themselves state there is a danger of collapse if no changes are made. We have no right over the future of others. Article 4.7.3 must therefore be amended.
President.  
– Thank you very much, Commissioner. Our rapporteur wishes to add a few words.

 WRITTEN DECLARATION (ARTICLE 120)
President. – 
 I know that the rapporteurs and draftsmen have put in a great deal of work, but I am afraid I must ensure that the schedule is observed. The draftsmen of opinions had two minutes’ speaking time and they exceeded that time by 40 seconds or a minute, or even a minute and a half, in the case of the last draftsman. I would ask the Members to stick as closely as possible to the speaking time allocated to them.
President. – 
 Before giving the Commission the floor once again, our rapporteur has asked to speak, pursuant to Rule 121(4) of the Rules of Procedure. I am happy to comply.
President. – 
 Thank you very much for your words, Commissioner. I wish to join with everyone who has congratulated the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, on the quality of his work. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.

Mr President, I really want to support the proposals of the rapporteur and Chairman of the Committee, Mr Rocard. There is no need to go into the appalling nature of the decision in 1999, which established selection entirely leaving out the ten countries that are joining us in less than a month. The solution proposed by the Commission, which aimed to split the procedure in two, would mean that for much too long a period – until 2019 – there would be two colleges, which is quite the opposite to integration. Integration does not mean continuing with two colleges within the Union and its selection and decision-making processes made up of old and new Member States. I think that this goes entirely against the desired objective, which we say is for them to become members. Therefore, and also for other reasons, I think it is wise to stop this in 2010. The other reasons are linked to the evaluation that is taking place, which you mentioned, Commissioner. I think that the deviations that have been highlighted by Mr Rocard, which are linked to decisions that are far too motivated by self-interest, exploitative and for reasons of prestige or even less attractive reasons, even political reasons, have reduced the European quality of these events and that is what we need to discuss. This is the quality that the new selection process, which we say we want, needs to reaffirm, definitely through competition, also taking into account the events that are taking place at the moment, such as Lille 2004. The event is on the one hand very attractive and factual, with very interesting things to see, but at the same time there is a great frustration among those involved. Artists and those involved in culture are quick to point out that this event, which is mainly focused around factual matters, could devalue their work as artists, break down the relationship that there normally is with the public and result in fierce competition between cultural structures. These collective comments from a network of cultural players and artists in a city or region where the ‘European Capital of Culture’ project is taking place, in Lille, should attract the attention and interest of the evaluation that is underway and encourage care. We should await the evaluation and try to find a selection and competition method that will promote adding value to Europe, as this is the challenge, to ensure that culture is valued across Europe.

Mr President, Commissioner, what is making things so very complicated, I believe, is the fact that we can never be sure of anything. I heard you welcome the efforts of the Moroccan authorities. For my part, I have just read the very recent report of the IFRM which was presented yesterday and which demonstrates the extent to which 11 September has had devastating effects in these countries, taking the form of many arbitrary imprisonments all over the place, which clearly represent a genuine violation of respect for human rights. So while we welcome the very interesting and noteworthy progress made in relation to the family code, certain extremely worrying elements nevertheless remain. I say this to demonstrate that the very considerable efforts agreed by the Commission and by this Parliament – which you stress yourselves – to reinforce all the mechanisms for action and assessment concerning respect for human rights are determined not only by the international context, but also by the relations that the EU’s Member States individually maintain with these different countries. How many programmes will we need in order to cancel out the disastrous effect of President Chirac’s visit to Tunisia, where he stated that there were no human rights problems, and, in the middle of a hunger strike by an eminent lawyer, that the main right is the right to eat? How many programmes will we need in order to remedy that? We are well aware that, in the evaluation of the association agreements, the constraints of the realpolitik
 on the part of the States are terrifying. We truly need to consolidate the Community efforts resulting from the support of the associations, of the NGOs, of civil society and, as we know, of the Members of this Parliament and the Commission. So there are actors who can perhaps overcome that handicap. But I would like to ask you directly, Commissioner, about any responsibility you may have in this regard. In Tunisia, how can we explain that, while the Ben Ali government is in the process of holding back the funds allocated to the Tunisian Human Rights League, the Commission is initiating a clearly nonsensical programme aimed at providing support for media that do not exist, which are shackled, entirely in the hands of Ben Ali? Everybody knows that Ben Ali is going to use this not inconsiderable sum to fund his presidential propaganda. Do you realise that or do you not? How is such a thing possible? That is something I really wonder about, as it is precisely on us that such a decision depends.

Mr President, I believe that in this debate our problem is not so much to reopen all the discussions we have held time and time again on the meaning and the nature of services of general interest, but to deal with the issue of security and the framework, and more precisely that of the democratic security and the democratic framework, within the context of the debate on services of general interest. Today’s speech, Commissioner Patten, has certainly been reassuring, but you will be aware that the same can be said of Commissioner Lamy’s speech, a month ago. At that time we talked about discussion, about very rich consultation – three hundred contributions – we planned to carry out an analysis, we talked about options available to us, about the framework directive, the consensus within the Convention in favour of a European law. And the Commission considered and considered … As for me, I have the feeling that in this way we are holding a form of debate which almost found its rhythm until the White Paper in April, while Commissioner Monti, during this time, has been presenting his ‘packages’, in which he makes snap decisions on the issues and all of this without debate and without discussion. I believe this is in unacceptable way of doing things, because the campaign for a democratic Europe, aimed at highlighting the added value of Community policies, is not going to be carried out by Mr Monti, but by us. However, if Mr Monti wants to, let him, instead of us, wage the electoral campaign to defend the social Europe.

 Mr President, I was hoping that Kofi Annan’s speech, which we heard last week, would provoke an outbreak of democracy on the part of the Commission and the Council in particular, but I see that in the end it has done no such thing. You have both referred to Tampere. It seems to me that Tampere was very well balanced from the point of view of rights and duties, status and control. It is quite clear from the list of the various measures, operations and agreements you have given us today, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that those measures are all concerned solely with security; that makes me extremely worried because I see some members of the Council being truly diabolical in their thinking. When I hear talk of outsourcing the examination of asylum applications, I really feel that everything has gone wrong. What really worries me is that I feel that the decisions being taken today in the Council or more appropriate formats – decisions by 5, or by 5+5, depending, at any rate on formulae that are seldom very clearly democratic – are an attack on democracy and the European project. I believe the penalty that can be expected for such an aberration would be quite clear, and Kofi Annan said it himself: tomorrow we will have a Europe that is meaner, poorer, weaker and older. I do not see that as a prospect that any of us, or any of the citizens of the European Union or third countries, can relish. In asking the Court of Justice to annul the decision on family reunification, the European Parliament is sending you a clear message that the Council is exceeding the bounds of democracy and I think if I were in your shoes I would want to take heed of that very strong warning from the European Parliament. I also think that instead of interpreting as it may Council decisions of which it does not really approve, the Commission would do better to interpret them by consulting its NGO partners. It would do well, with all associations, European civil society and all parliamentarians who stand up for rights, international conventions and democracy, to really cause that outbreak to happen so that in future all decisions are taken in a spirit of parliamentary co-decision as desired in the draft Constitution.

Mr President, let us simply remember that today’s debate on the future of services of general interest is taking place at a particularly significant moment in the history of Europe, at a time when Europe is in the midst of a debate on its future, on its constitution, and when we are preparing to welcome a host of new citizens of the Union from the countries of the East. I am reminding the House of this fact because I believe that a link exists between the difficulties we experienced, during the debate on the draft constitution, in reaching agreement on the recognition of a positive right to services of general interest and its enshrinement in European law and the considerable obstacles which we have encountered – and which our excellent rapporteur, Mr Herzog, certainly had to confront in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs – in trying to advance this principle. Moreover, I believe it would be extremely prejudicial if this report were less ambitious than the compromise – insufficient though it was, it did constitute an improvement – which we obtained in the framework of the debate on the draft Constitution. It would be difficult in these circumstances, ladies and gentlemen, to convince people that we are representing them properly, because I am not the only one who perceives a firm belief in the public mind that European integration will mean more services, better services, more protection, more safety – food safety, maritime safety, security in the widest sense – in this high-risk society. Broad-based movements within our European societies today are also voicing clear demands for the effective exercise of citizens’ social rights – the right to education, culture, health care, environmental protection, clean water and clean air as well as rights of access to housing, transport, communication, information, energy supplies, etc. In short, all of us – I hope – are convinced that these services are essential, but I have the impression that some Members of this Chamber are doggedly determined to reinstate scurrilous paragraphs which effectively detract from Mr Herzog’s excellent work. For example, they emphasise the inestimable benefits of liberalisation, but they will not manage to convince us, for the market cannot provide all of these services in accordance with the principles of equal accessibility and universality – hence the absolute necessity of a recognised positive right to services of general interest. This being the case, I hope that the amendments you vote to adopt tomorrow will rid us of a document which, in its present form, is extremely compromising for our European Parliament and will seriously undermine the dialogue in which we shall be engaging over the coming months with the people of every European country.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not know whether I shall find anything much to add to Mrs Gillig’s superb speech. I believe this report will not allow me to move towards workers at Metaleurop, Alstom, France Télécom or many other companies, who are currently clearly threatened by mass restructuring and harsh, unacceptable mass redundancies, often due, furthermore, to shareholders’ completely uncontrolled actions. In this context, the endless calls for social dialogue are a rather surreal figure of speech. The commitment we must make today is very clearly to a policy of democratisation within companies that breaks with this unacceptable way in which employees are currently hired and fired, given intermittent work or made redundant. I believe that the social situation, which is further exacerbated by the economic recession, is currently creating a despicable climate to which this report is certainly not capable of responding in a credible way. Must we, in this kind of situation, forbid ourselves from investigating, from taking a closer look – I am well aware that it is rather unusual to talk about this in this House – at certain experiments in reducing working hours, negotiated experiments which create jobs, which have considerably improved the economic performance of certain large companies, which have considerably improved the quality of social relations in the workplace and the quality of work? Must we prevent ourselves from taking a look at these experiments and drawing the conclusions that, in my opinion, are generally extremely interesting? Must we stop ourselves examining the capacity to develop many activities that are useful socially or for environmental management and whose potential we suspect, but which, I regret to say, receive very little support or recognition. I believe it would be far more interesting to show imagination, rather than to keep trotting out old-fashioned ideas that we have heard all too often. We must start to show an interest in this kind of debate and initiative.

 – (FR) Mr President, President of the Commission, I support and welcome the Commission’s statement which expresses the political desire to build closer relations with neighbouring countries. I feel, however, that the issue of borders constitutes an element of discord in this climate of rapprochement. We have established a series of measures relating to relations with third countries, particularly our neighbours, in order to integrate the management of the flow of migrants. These concern border controls, the control of illegal immigration and agreements on readmission. I wonder whether we are really in the process of subcontracting the management of migration to our neighbours, so creating a buffer zone between the European Union and the rest of the world, which would probably be less laudable. In my opinion, these measures serve to promote the establishment of detention zones in these neighbouring countries both within and on the borders of Europe. I am referring to zones run in a heavy-handed and arbitrary manner, where the kind of rights enshrined in the founding values we wish to share, are, more often than not, flouted. I would therefore urge you to consider the risks currently involved.

Commissioner, you said that the restructuring of companies in the steel sector, but also in the metal sector, went back a long way. It goes back 25 years. What I would like to highlight is the difference that there is now in the nature of those restructuring processes. You are aware that, 20 years ago, entire regions were abandoned and employees stripped of their jobs in the name of modernisation and productivity. It was extremely painful, but there was the feeling of understanding that a change was taking place, which rightly or wrongly was seen as necessary, so people felt abandoned but understood more or less why it had happened. Now, the problem that we have is that it no longer makes sense, in other words now in restructuring what we see at work is the rule that anything goes, and in particular the rule of the shareholders that is imposed suddenly, unfairly, arbitrarily and unexpectedly. These stories no longer make sense, which makes them depressing. In other words, people are either revolted or completely depressed by them. They particularly despair of Europe, because all of the restructuring processes are taking place at European level. So you see a sort of ping pong match going on: closing something here, buying something else here, in Poland in the case of that company. So everyone feels like they are competing with everyone else, which is a point that I would like to stress. How do you expect citizens to give any credit to Europe or have the slightest desire for Europe if that Europe appears to them to be first and foremost a battlefield of competition, with shareholders that are at times corrupt making the rules? Should we talk about Glencor, the corrupt shareholder, as there are people in this House who do not like names to be mentioned? Can we leave industrial and economic development strategies and thousands of jobs in the hands of a corrupt shareholder who is capable of sinking the Prestige
, buying some profitable gems within Metaleurop, and leaving a region with unacceptable pollution? I think that we should also mention the terrible pollution of sites and serious threats to the health of employees, their children and their families. Who is responsible? Who should pay? Are companies predators taking advantage as the shareholders dictate and then leaving all the damage in the hands of the public authorities? Or will Europe equip itself to regulate that and impose some restrictions? There are some very simple things that can be done. It is essential that we increase the power of employees on a European scale. Employees need to be able to discuss and take part in company strategies, coordinate and fight their battles together. Everyone here has condemned the Commission’s declaration as lacking in ambition. It is true that it is lacking in ambition, I am not going to say otherwise. However, ladies and gentlemen, we also need to realise that while the Commission can say no to a merger due to a monopoly situation and competition law not being complied with, it cannot say no to restructuring which is ignoring legislation on informing and consulting workers. I would ask that this be considered in the debate on the social Europe within the Convention. There was a recent newspaper headline: ‘the Convention is pushing aside the social Europe’. Let us think about that. Do we want citizens to have lost all hope in Europe? I want the Commission to be able to say no to restructuring that is violating European legislation. However it is not the Commission that did not want that, but our Member States, in the Council, who chose to retain the legal and administrative means to allow it or not. How do you expect that to work? I want the Commission to have the power to say no to restructuring that is violating employees’ rights, and failing to consider the environment and the reclassification of sites. And in my opinion, that comes under the Convention. Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to put pressure on all those involved with the Convention in your groups, all those that you have contact with, to make progress on the social Europe. Otherwise that Europe will be depressing, and believe me, the people will not support it when they are consulted by referendum.

Mr President, I think that the elements that some of my colleagues have described as puns and shams actually reflect a delicate point: the fact that the aim of this Spring Summit is to coordinate three policies, economic, social and sustainable development, whereas the Treaties do not provide the legal bases to enable us to act in these three areas at once. It is therefore clear that our proposals look like pious hopes or we appear to be reaffirming our will  while we know that we do not have the tools to achieve it. Therefore, underlying our debates and the Spring Summit that is being prepared, there is a fundamental challenge involving reforming the Treaties with a view to the new Constitution for the European Union. I think that if we want to arrive at a structured concept by determining how these three elements can form a sound cycle of development in Europe, we would be well advised to look more closely at what is happening in the services of general interest sector. If there is a triangle, services of general interest are the barycentre of it. Let us think about that and look at how our European policies are operating today. President-in-Office of the Council, we will not achieve any results by trying, on the one hand, to speed up the construction of the internal market, with all that it involves in terms of opening up to competition and, ultimately, privatisation, and by seeking, on the other hand, to maintain the balance by arguing that it will be done in the interests of the public, of social cohesion, etc. We have a duty to evaluate what has been done, and that will help us to think about how economic activity, which is supposed to fulfil fundamental rights and ensure social and territorial cohesion, can or should be considered and integrated into the new Treaties. Where is the evaluation? Where is the framework directive for services of general interest? Where are our proposals to strengthen Article 16 of the Treaty, particularly regarding the resources and tasks of these services of general interest? I think that if we are capable of moving forward in our discussion, without being dogmatic, looking at what is happening and what it would be appropriate to do, our ideas will begin to take shape. You know, brains are indeed precious, but what counts above all is collective intelligence, and that is what we especially have among users, employees and operators, just like among elected representatives who are reminded every day of the cost of the closure of public services in their countries. Frankly, I think that this is a very important indicator that we need to use and take advantage of for the years to come.

 Mr President, I too would like to thank Baroness Ludford. I think that her pertinent oral questions have enabled us to have a debate which is obviously very interesting. I agree essentially with her analysis of the situation. I believe that we cannot really accuse the Council of any lack of activity this year. One might even say that the Council was overcome by a kind of feverishness, obviously under the influence of the atmosphere produced by the events of 11 September, the ultra-security-consciousness of public opinion and, more directly, electoral concerns, which shows quite clearly that the study of a certain number of issues would profit by being shared equally between opinions, through the positions adopted by the European Parliament and the initiatives of the Commission. When it comes to the general interests of Europe, the sum of national egoisms does not constitute the law. I should like to draw your attention to work which is currently in progress. My group has had the pleasure of bringing together a certain number of involved people from all over Europe, who are studying the question of the isolation of foreigners in Europe. It is quite frightening. The analyses that have been made, on a country by country basis, show that there have been considerable developments which are quite alarming. Camps are proliferating, camps in all forms, of all kinds, with or without official status, open or closed, in which foreigners are sorted, guarded, imprisoned, punished, and kept handy for forced repatriation or whatever. I believe that these obvious denials of people’s right, for example to seek asylum in Europe, are extremely worrying. I would ask the Commission to examine these practices closely and to determine to what extent, since they are initially the responsibility of national States, European policy is likely to result in or encourage actions of this type on the part of Member States. For example, we discovered at the seminar that readmission agreements were actually an incitement to Member States to create such camps. In the final analysis, therefore, the question is whether, in the light of what I believe to be the satisfactory results of the Convention working party, we should encourage the Council to work this year, or whether we ought to wait until new decision-making methods make it possible to achieve greater equilibrium between the three aspects of the area that we have been talking about just now.

 Mr President, as other Members have pointed out: 17 000 families have no news of their loved ones, parts of the media have been banned, censored by the authorities, journalists have been arrested, the courts have been used for political ends, the intelligence services are ubiquitous, discriminatory measures have been taken against thousands of refugees, and Palestinians in particular, torture has been used despite the fact that Lebanon is a signatory to the Convention against torture, Syria has constantly interfered in the life of a third country, there has been discrimination against women; there is a long list of infringements of human rights as reported, in particular at the hearing held within the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. All the organisations fighting for democracy in this country, however, support the idea of this association agreement. This, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner and President-in-Office of the Council, goes to show the tremendous hope generated by this agreement, as well as the scale of the challenges we must accept in order to respond to these numerous expectations. The resolution submitted to us on which we shall vote at the same time as the association agreement is a relatively comprehensive text – and I would congratulate the rapporteur on that, moreover – which addresses numerous problems that Lebanon must now face in order to play the role we expect it to play to ensure the stabilisation of the situation throughout the region. The Verts/ALE Group has duly contributed to this and we, together with other Members, in fact, would like to add a few points that we feel are important today. First of all, we would like to invite, to call on the Lebanese Government to ensure respect for the rights of refugees, migrants and asylum seekers, who are present on Lebanese soil, and to cease all kinds of discriminatory measures in particular against Palestinian refugees. We would also like the Commission and the Council to ask Syria and Israel officially for information on Lebanese nationals who are being held in these states. According to the information provided to us by Solidar, whose spokesman, moreover, was invited to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Israel is allegedly holding 12 Lebanese nationals and 200 nationals of other countries are allegedly being held secretly in Syria. I believe the European institutions can help to shed light on this matter, which weighs heavily on relations within the region. The Verts/ALE Group in the European Parliament would also like to draw the attention of the House to the pressure exerted on the Lebanese press. We call for strict respect for the freedom of the press, in all its forms, moreover, in particular for journalists or other media that criticise government policy. We call for this country to respect the right of the opposition, which we all know receives extremely poor treatment. Lastly, we call for the Members of the Lebanese Parliament to be associated with and play an active part in the work of the fora of the future Euro-Mediterranean assembly. That is clearly a condition if we understand that this agreement with Lebanon is even more important in stabilising the region and finding a solution to the problems in the Middle East. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, this association agreement constitutes a challenge, which we must meet. I believe that its effect would be greater if we were in possession of all the instruments necessary to monitor, follow, propose and assess, regularly and seriously, in particular the implementation of Article 2 of this association agreement.

 Commissioner, I am quite surprised to hear you say that it has been proven for 20 years that the single market governed by competition law is perfectly – as you said – compatible with social objectives. I have already heard more sense from the Commission, when it started to express a doubt precisely as to this ability of competition law to bring about the achievement of all the social and environmental objectives. I believe that, in actual fact, we, and the Commission, in particular, would find it much easier to make these self-congratulatory statements if we had an evaluation, as my fellow Members have said. I feel that there is absolutely nothing to be gained in any quarter by underestimating the huge expectations of the European citizens, who are demanding more services, better quality and a higher level of safety. I believe that, if we were to turn a deaf ear to the doubts being expressed today regarding the continuity and sustainability of these services, particularly since 
they have been called into question as a result of disasters and 
particularly since this deterioration is currently evident in a number of public services, we would be severely jeopardising the future of Europe and the result of the decision that its citizens will have to take on the future Constitution. You have decided to open a broad consultation 
process 
on the Green Paper. It is true that this initiative is very surprising, given its connection with the – extremely problematic – debates that we wish to hold within the Convention with a view to fully enshrining the right to public service in the future European Constitution. I would therefore like to hear you speak about the organisation of the agendas, for it would appear quite incredible that a debate should be opened on the feasibility or usefulness of a framework directive under the current Treaties, even if the aim of the debate is to achieve the recognition of and basis for a European approach to public services in the future Treaty. Moreover, as regards the consultation procedure, we have already been sufficiently traumatised by a number of proposals which were clearly going against a whole range of different interests within European society. I would like the Commission to explain clearly which public method of hearing will be used to enable the different players – users, trade unions, NGOs, local and regional authorities etc. – to make themselves heard during this consultation on the Green Paper.

 Mr President, I believe that the adoption of this excellent report, prepared by my fellow Member, Mrs Lambert, has become a question of humanitarian and democratic urgency. In the absence of a common European policy on asylum and immigration issues, we are now witnessing unacceptable competition in Europe between all the governments of the various EU Member States, designed to downgrade the conditions for receiving refugees, so as to be the most unwelcoming and the most unattractive, and which also aims to criminalise refugees on the pretext of fighting against phenomena such as illegal immigration. The French and British Ministers, Mr Sarkozy and Mr Blunkett, are obviously no exception to the rule, and the agreement that they have recently reached in favour of the closure of the Sangatte refugee camp is a tragic illustration of this situation: this agreement seeks primarily to increase the repressive measures and to downgrade reception conditions in Great Britain. Refugees are now tagged, sorted and given a hearing without even having been officially informed of the agreement and the closure plan. Commissioner, this is a question that you could, in my opinion, raise with them with the approval of the UNHCR, which occupies a highly ambiguous position in this scenario. The people of Afghanistan have already demonstrated how strongly they oppose the proposal of EUR 2 000 that they have been offered to return home voluntarily and how insulting this proposal is to them. They are also drawing our attention to their tragic existence in Afghanistan which, if not tragic before the war, would certainly be so on their return home, to their children and their families, but empty-handed, let there be no doubt about that.

Madam President, of course this agreement is not the result of an extensive process of participation and negotiation between all the main players from both sides. Consequently, it is what it is. Our support, however, for the challenge of forging lasting political relations between both sides of the Mediterranean is unstinting, and we also hope that the Algerian crisis can emerge from behind closed doors where it has tragically played out for too long. We would therefore like to take up the challenge of shared development. Mr Morillon, I am going to put your mind at ease, please be reassured: we are not interfering when we talk of the democratic deficit and of the importance of supporting the development of freedom in this country. The report of the Arab States office of the United Nations Development Programme says this itself. It is therefore not a matter of interference at all. Democracy is the foundation of development in all its forms. However, in order to meet this challenge, in order 
to take up this challenge of shared development, we must begin by not adding confusion to the chaos in Algeria. Certainly, this agreement must not give the authorities free rein. In order to avoid this, it is necessary to very clearly acknowledge that, today, it is practically indecent to deny that the violence that has blighted Algeria for more than ten years is down to groups of all kinds, and when I say all kinds, clearly I am also talking about military security groups. This has to be said! Paramilitary groups. This has to be written! Mr Habib Souaidia, who is present here today along with other friends whom I would like to greet, was accused of slander by General Nezzar. Mr Souaidia said that the generals, who are the real politicians and decision-makers, have killed thousands of people for no reason at all. The case brought by Mr Nezzar was thrown out. Will we have just the merest fraction of the courage of this Algerian lieutenant? I believe that we should start by acknowledging in our resolution the suffering and tragedy, the hundreds of thousands who have died and the thousands who have disappeared. Secondly, our resolution must clearly call for the lifting of the state of emergency which is a real denial of freedom, and the public authorities with whom we negotiate, by declaring this state of emergency, have even let their prerogatives lapse, under the guise of military power. How can we accept this?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that today we must determine why Member States are competing in an unfair and negative manner to win the prize for being the most off-putting State in terms of the way it welcomes nationals from other countries. It is this competition which is creating the tragic situations that we are now seeing, on a daily basis, in the Sangatte refugee centre, at Tarifa, in Italy, and in many other parts of Europe. These tragic situations are clearly calling into question the fundamental rights of individuals, the right to asylum and the international commitments to which we subscribed. The proposal for harmonisation is, of course, heading in the right direction, since it is seeking to halt the downward spiral in the conditions in which asylum applicants are received in Europe. It is heading in the right direction and will become fully credible within the framework of a common asylum and immigration policy with a European statute for refugees. We therefore welcome this prospect and the initial work, which will effectively guarantee rights such as the right to work, to education, health, housing, schooling, vocational training and fundamental rights, all of which are inseparable. The proposal aims to avoid a situation that we know all too well: asylum applicants trying to enter countries illegally, reception centres being inundated and, ultimately, the rights that we want to promote being violated. I think that, in this area, we must make every possible effort. We cannot give scope to those who want Europe to be based primarily on xenophobia, the rejection of all that is foreign and the fear of the unknown. In this area, it is the European project itself that we must defend. (Applause from the left)

Mr President, I am not speaking as one of the authors of the motion, because the Group of the Greens does not support this compromise proposal. What exactly are we talking about here? Are we talking about Eurotunnel’s loss of earnings and the disruption to traffic under the Channel or are we talking about what should be the subject of this afternoon’s debate, human rights and, in this particular instance, the rights and the human tragedy of the Sangatte refugees? The refugees in Sangatte are not illegal immigrants. They are living in a centre opened by the French government, managed by the Red Cross and subsidised by the French state. The refugees are Kosovars, Kurds and, nowadays, mainly Afghans. All the people who feature in today’s headlines are flooding into Sangatte. If we want to talk about human rights, then let us do so and stop talking about money and the safety of traffic under the Channel. There is something obscene about confusing the two. This centre was opened thanks to important work by the associations who wanted to respond to the emergency, and to close it would be a humanitarian catastrophe. We know what Calais and Sangatte are like without the centre. We have seen the refugees risking their lives to get to Great Britain, wandering the streets of Calais with their children in the pouring rain, with the associations doing their best to get food to them every day. Is that really the sort of situation we want to revert to in a debate on human rights? Frankly, this debate has got off to a very poor start, which is why the Greens do not support this motion and call on their fellow members to do likewise, because there is something improper about it. The Group of the Greens, having taken the view that the French Government was demonstrating a measure of bad faith regarding the right of these people to demand asylum in France, supported the publication of a document, in collaboration with the associations, which is in huge demand among the refugees in Sangatte. What does this document say? It simply tells the refugees how to demand asylum in France and what rights asylum seekers have in France. This is the road we should be going down, obviously in the long term, with our sights set on a European refugee statute, in order to deal with this situation.

 Mr President, the conflict in the Middle East is today sending shock waves through all the countries of the Mediterranean. This subject will certainly be at the centre of the discussions in Valencia. Sympathy for the colonised Palestinian people, which is felt well beyond Arab societies, is increasing in these countries in particular, due to the endless cultural, social and political humiliations and frustrations that the people suffer and for which they hold Arab and Western leaders jointly responsible. That is why the desire for a dignified life where they and the law are respected is leading the people of these countries increasingly to take the dangerous path of anti-Western nationalism, be it Arab or religious. This development, which is heightened by the international community’s inability to put an end to the massacre and restore respect for law in the Middle East, is detrimental to the cultural and civil dialogue called for by the Barcelona Process. It also demonstrates the urgent and important need for this dialogue. In fact, the only thing the Barcelona Process can do – the challenge before it – is to provide the support it has hitherto failed to provide for democratisation in the countries of the Mediterranean. If we do not suspend the Association Agreement with Israel, then not only will the Israeli tanks have crushed the territories, they will have also crushed Article 2 of this Agreement, as well as Article 2 of all the Association Agreements. What would we be able to say in response to the constitutional coup d’état
 of 
Ben Ali in Tunisia? How would we be able to respond to the aspirations of Algerian society, which has been taken hostage by two camps that are both enemies of democracy? The notion that economic development necessarily leads to democracy is absolute nonsense. The aim of sustainable development, namely ecological development and development of solidarity, in the Mediterranean, cannot be reduced to the concept of the free-trade area. Do we have any idea as to the consequences for employment, public services, and people’s lives, the consequences of the measures to liberalise this trade? From this perspective, democracy is certainly a condition for development. The requirement for democracy is not only a necessity, which some people describe as neo-colonial, it is, in fact, a fundamental element of the relations that we must establish in this region.

 Mr President, it is a pity that our opinion is only being submitted after Barcelona, thus limiting the scope of tomorrow’s vote. At Barcelona, the Council set itself the objective of increasing the retirement age by five years by 2010, without any conclusion from Parliament or the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the subject, and, most importantly, without taking account of the expectations of the citizens and the social partners, for whom this idea is completely unacceptable. The European Union, which is not competent to decide on matters of social protection but which, in fact, is exercising this competence in the name of establishing the single market in funded pensions, should play a greater part in extending the public debate on the future of pensions. How should this be done? First of all, by noting, as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has done, that this is essentially a social challenge with financial aspects, and not the other way round. Second, this challenge will only be taken up if we accept that the determining factor will be the employment rate rather than population ageing. We already knew that pension funds do not affect the key choices that have to be made by society: what is this question? What is this choice? What proportion of overall wealth do we want to allocate to pensioners? In the past, we upheld the contributory pension system as a collective system of inter-generational support that creates a social link. Now, we should be completely immune to capitalisation, in view of the Enron affair and the situation of British insurers who are begging their clients to use contributory pension services. For many companies, employment remains a factor in cost adjustment. The oldest workers, who are also the best paid, often pay the price of company exclusion policies. Under these conditions, we cannot pretend to be astonished that those under threat of unemployment and poverty choose early retirement. An entirely different goal would be necessary in order to achieve modernisation that takes in to account developments in work and life stages and to create a genuine right to gradual retirement.

 Mr President, we think that the revision of the postal directive is untenable, from the point of view of the general interest of European citizens, and it would be politically irresponsible to take a vote for it today. Why? Because we all know the social role fulfilled by the postal service in poorer urban areas and in rural or outlying areas. And we know, we all understand perfectly well – a six year-old child could work this out – that reducing the scope of reserved services undermines the ability of operators to make financial adjustments, which are the basis of solidarity. This solidarity also enables the necessary modernisation to be undertaken so that high quality services can be provided for all. Will we soon be telling taxpayers that they will have to put money in the kitty to finance universal service, as they do in the Netherlands? After this vote, are we going to show our support for post office closures or our support for the postal workers who are going to be laid off? Are we going to take part in these demonstrations after voting on this position? Certainly not. We cannot accept a common position today that is still too similar to the position adopted at first reading. There is nothing new in the debate. I have not heard anyone say that the price of a stamp has gone down in Sweden. I have not heard anyone say that there has been compensation for the jobs that have been lost at traditional operators. I have not heard anyone say that the new operators are considering introducing a single price for the European postage stamp. There is absolutely nothing new here. We are still waiting for the Commission to provide the evaluations that were planned in 1997 and that have been called for in two resolutions adopted by Parliament and in the report by Mr Ferber. I urge my fellow Members… (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, two years after the Lisbon Summit, the most optimistic and most willing Europeans recall the announcement of a new paradigm: to make the European Union the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world and achieve greater social cohesion. This strategy, which was finalised at Gothenburg, is becoming a strategy for sustainable development in the environmental and social spheres. We wanted to believe this, we would like to believe this, we still want to believe this, but, in reality, the integration of economic, social and environmental dimensions is still merely an illusion. The Spanish Presidency, however, is not pretending. It is working with great honesty. It perceives the Union’s sustainable development to be the efficiency of markets, goods, services, capital and employment. Can we pretend to believe this? They want to sell us the accelerated liberalisation of the markets, transport, electricity and gas, although they know that this will result in our being less capable of supplying services to combat poverty, to provide social protection; it will bring about less territorial cohesion and fewer high-quality jobs, as all the studies have shown. We are providing flexibility in the employment market and the mobility of employees instead of a real job creation policy. Mr Bullmann’s report is trying to achieve the impossible. He would like to have his cake and eat it. He wants the commitments of the Stability and Growth Pact to be fulfilled and to see investment in education, research, the environment and networks. He wants high-quality employment and flexibility in the market. There is no doubt, in our view, that the real priorities of the Barcelona Summit are the development of the social economy based on solidarity, an independent income, including for young people who are slipping further into poverty, a real definition of services of general interest, a reduction in working time, investment in the environment and lifestyle. These, in our opinion, are the priorities of the Barcelona Summit.

 Mr President, my group supports the recommendation for second reading, which, moreover, received the very broad approval of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. In addition, we would like the Council to follow suit and thus put a definitive end to the three long years that have passed since the Commission, perceiving the breakdown in social dialogue, made very timely use of its right of initiative. This is three years too many, which have been punctuated by social catastrophes, with rapid liquidation of businesses and loss of jobs due to bankruptcy and genuine distortions in Community social law on information and consultation of workers. While we must not expect miracles from this directive, because it will only apply, at best, to businesses with more than 50 employees and will not single-handedly resolve the fundamental problem, namely that competition law is dominant, this directive may represent a significant step towards harmonising the rights of European Union employees, subject, of course, to it not being stripped of its content and reduced to the smallest common denominator. This is why it is so important that the Council take into consideration the recommendations proposed by Mrs Ghilardotti, particularly Amendment Nos 2 and 12 on sanctions for disregard of the directive. Although the Council is opposed to European sanctions, the least it can do, in my view, is to accept this compromise position. We also support amendments which clarify and widen the scope of the information that must be provided to employees’ representatives, and the amendment proposing the latter may request a decision’s application be suspended, pending the outcome of new negotiations, where this decision has serious effects on jobs. If our citizens are to find this directive credible, it will have to be applied simultaneously throughout the European Union. That is why our group asks the Council to support the position submitted to us, and make it impossible for some Member States to evade having to enforce the application of the directive for several more years. Our group proposes to supplement the draft recommendation by adopting amendments that rule out the possibility of withholding information that the company considers sensitive to its business from employees’ representatives, because we are convinced that there are no grounds, that it even constitutes discrimination to introduce an element of suspicion with regard to employees who, by definition, have no less company spirit than the management or shareholders.

 Several days ago, a leading French newspaper ran a headline story on the efforts bring made to combat rising unemployment and it described the wave of near-panic sweeping through the announcements of poor unemployment figures. At times like these, when a recession may be looming, we find it even more regrettable that employment is not the main priority of the economic and monetary guidelines. I would like to reiterate that the Group of the Greens believes that employment policy cannot only have the function of monitoring or softening the peaks and troughs of the globalised economy by creating safety nets, by helping those who are out of work to find their way back into the job market. This is all the Luxembourg process has achieved, it is also, evidently, all that the guidelines proposed by the Commission for 2002 are likely to achieve, and is also all that the Weiler report, which is part of this approach, can achieve. Whilst expressing regret that the Member States did little in response to their invitation to set objectives for unemployment levels, the Commission and the Council have quite rightly placed the emphasis on verifying the qualitative impact of the policies implemented. In order to clarify this approach, we are proposing two amendments. The first proposes to draw up comparable statistics on the various types of employment, in other words, including underemployment, partial unemployment, and to assess the consequences of so-called employment incentive measures in terms of enhanced social inclusion or exclusion. Our second amendment proposes to strengthen the action of employment monitoring services in order to prevent flexible short-term contracts being abused. We must, as a matter of urgency, curb the development of poverty, lack of job security, and unpleasant working conditions. We still need to introduce a policy to create businesses and jobs. Instead of despairing over poor growth forecasts as if these were gloomy weather reports, we should try to shape this policy in accordance with our objectives on social and territorial cohesion, and decide on, for example, the necessary large-scale investments, including public investment, draw up a European job creation policy, and not simply a work placement policy.

 Mr President, the proposal for a directive on the involvement of employees in the European company gives us our first opportunity to establish at Community level a precise definition of what is meant by the right to information, consultation and participation of employees in all companies. The proposal determines the registration to a trade regime by companies which may choose this new statute following a negotiated agreement on employee involvement. Under these conditions, the Group of the Greens is not turning its nose up at it; the group supports Mr Menrad’s report and its proposals, the aim of which is the swift adoption and effective implementation of this directive. Of course, we will do this in the belief that this required condition certainly does not allow us to consider that European legislation genuinely fulfils current needs. As soon as the vote is over, we must carry on and get back down to work on this issue. You are aware that this directive will in future only apply to the employees of companies that choose this new statute, in other words, a small minority. That is why we must obviously stop ourselves from celebrating and trying to make an impact. We will only have made progress when we have simultaneously adopted this directive, revised the directive that we discussed earlier on European works councils and approved the Directive on Information and Consultation of Employees under conditions that differ slightly from the position adopted by the Council. The co-decision procedure must be used in order to perform this legislative work under conditions which guarantee a genuine debate, involving society and citizens. I would like to stress that the Group of the Greens rejects the pressure that inevitably leads to restricting its right to legislate, on the pretext of being efficient and swift, particularly because, as we all know, this dossier dates back a long way.

 Mr President, the relevance that employees and citizens give to European social policy is being distorted further with each passing day, because of numerous cases of restructurings and redundancies. The revision of the Directive on European Works Councils is obviously a crucial way of clawing back this credibility. So what do the employees who are victims of these restructurings have to say about the possibility of using this directive? To take some examples, they say that the current legislation on the right to information and consultation is flouted on a regular basis by companies, due to the lack of precise definitions for these terms, that they have no administrative and judicial support which is needed in order to check compliance with the directive, that the directive only applies in very restricted circumstances and is not at all applicable in many transnational companies with numbers of employees lower than the current threshold, that it is inconceivable that authorisations for mergers are granted when the only criterion to be fulfilled is that of observing the competition law and that the social, regional or environmental impact of mergers is not taken into account, that they are powerless when mergers are taking place, during which previous consultation procedures are no longer used, since new procedures have yet to be set up, and, finally, that they are disgusted to see that the same companies which undertake these severe restructurings have occasionally received assistance from the Structural Funds. In my view, Mr Menrad’s report, which is the result of work that was carried out in an open, cooperative spirit, involving the social actors concerned and members of the Commission, which organised a broad public hearing on this issue, recommends bridging these gaps with a precise definition of information and consultation, by reducing, as proposed, the thresholds of employees required to establish a works council, by requesting that specific premises for consultation are maintained during mergers, by requesting that decisions made and which flout procedures can be overturned, and by introducing sanctions, including financial, for companies at fault and finally, by taking into account the opinion of employees and providing evidence that the procedures of the directive have been observed, prior to giving authorisations to mergers. Within this context, these proposals have the support of our group. Obviously, we still need to ensure – and this requires a combined effort – that the directive is revised quickly and effectively.

 Mr President, seeing the great care taken by the Ecofin Council to anticipate the long-term impact that funding pensions has on public finances makes one wish that equivalent care could be demonstrated with regard to sustainability, in order to prevent the deplorable long-term effects, for example, of the lack of fiscal harmonisation or of investments in the nuclear industry. Do not think, however, that the Group of the Greens is suggesting that we entrust the future of pensions to the Ministers of Finance. We support those in the Commission, in some Member States and in Parliament, who see the future of pensions and of social protection primarily as social issues, as key elements of the model, which must be strengthened, and which cannot be reduced to its financial dimension. To hear some people talk, we might wonder if the prospect of living increasingly longer, and by ‘living longer’ I mean in good health as well, is not the greatest disaster threatening the citizens of the twenty-first century. The report by Mr Cercas Alonso has the merit of not skirting the crux of the issue and of the debate. A certain increase in spending on pensions in the GDP is certainly unavoidable because of greater life expectancy, but the rapporteur quite rightly emphasises that changes in the rate of employment is a decisive factor. In this context, he recommends taking account of the rate of economic dependence and not only of demographic changes. Given the prospect of full employment, this takes us away from alarmist rates, which clearly seek to legitimise new forms of finance, raised individually and through capitalisation. The report also emphasises the invaluable role of guaranteed pension systems in combating the insecurity and social exclusion of the elderly, particularly women and workers who have had long periods of atypical work and who should be guaranteed a sufficient level of income to lead a decent life. Lastly, the report warns against any attempt to undermine public pay-as-you-go pension systems. These systems guarantee intergenerational solidarity, which is essential to social cohesion and they enable real-time adjustments to be made to contributions, regardless of the fluctuations of the stock market situation. This is why our group recommends that we adopt this report, without undermining its current balance. (Applause)

 Mr President, I believe that the great merit of these reports is that they tone down the optimism of the Commission’s communication regarding what it calls the progress made since Barcelona, and that they open the way to ambitious and fairer paths for the partnership to take. What were the objectives of that partnership? They are, once again, the creation of an area of peace, the improvement of mutual understanding amongst the peoples of the region and the creation of an area of shared prosperity. The first two goals have not been achieved, as Mr Naïr has said. Unfortunately, this is true. We have not created an area of shared prosperity either, only the very beginnings of a free-trade area involving some of the countries, established on European terms, because the main beneficiaries of these are the industrial products in which we have a competitive advantage. I am continually surprised, moreover, that those who are the quickest to call for an extension of a free-trade area, imposing the liberal model on terms that are extremely unfavourable for the countries of the South, are also the first to speak of interference, even neo-colonialism, with regard to human rights issues. In Barcelona, the vital contribution of civil society to the development of partnerships was recognised for the first time in a text to which the European Union and 15 countries of the southern Mediterranean subscribed. We must admit that we have failed spectacularly on this issue. We have been unable to support the dynamic efforts of citizens and democratic projects, in the face of the hard line adopted by most governments, but is this from lack of any real will to do so? How can we use the association agreements and the MEDA programme to support them? What sort of effective strategy and what set of relevant measures can we create in order to avoid this schizoid situation where what we say and what we do are two quite different things? Do we really wish to reinvigorate the Barcelona Process, or would we rather condemn ourselves to the Europe of the Fifteen’s continuing to pursue relations in the same traditional mould as some self-styled ‘realistic’ states?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is six months since the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on the Tunisian government to stop violating human rights and to work in support of fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and the development of the civil society. And still the Tunisian regime is committing one violation after another and sinking deeper and deeper into generalised police repression. I personally attended a parody of a trial on 24 November, at which the accused, who had been on hunger strike for three months and were unable to move or speak, were sentenced to 17 years in prison. I stood in front of the prison in Tunis on 9 April and watched hundreds of policemen breaking up a demonstration of solidarity organised by democrats. I witnessed powers being handed over within the human rights league a week before it was placed in official receivership. Daily harassment and beatings of democrats are a standard occurrence. These people are hounded – such as Hamma Hammami, sentenced to 9 years in prison, or Moncef Marzouki who, as you have heard, is due to go on trial the day after tomorrow. Any meeting, any gathering, such as the national conference organised by the Tunisian National Council for Liberties on 10 December, is effectively banned due to police violence. Any free and independent expression is censored, as is illustrated by the seizure of the books of Taoufik Ben Brik. What can we say, what can we do to meet this challenge, our challenge, the challenge of our international commitments? The vote by the House on the demanding motion before us will show that, no, we have decided not to throw in the towel. The call for a meeting of the Association Council on the human rights situation in Tunisia should be followed by real action... (The President cut the speaker off)

 Madam President, the legislative proposal before us concludes a high-quality parliamentary debate which testifies, if indeed it were necessary, to Parliament’s irreplaceable role in voicing the opinions of European citizens and giving expression to the diversity of experience from one region to another. If the voices of users and consumers, the postal workers and the unions are listened to, if attention is paid to the concerns of the public authorities and of local councillors and if account is taken of the opposition voiced by a number of governments to this development, then it might well be wondered where Commissioner Bolkestein’s proposal has come from, so unrealistic and unworkable does it appear to be. How was the Commission, which is supposed to represent the overall interests of Europe, able to propose a development so contrary to what is called for by the relevant players? Is there a certain kind of ultra-liberal dogmatism that makes one particularly blind and deaf? How has the Commission been able to avoid assessing the previous stage before proposing moving on to the next stage? All it would seem to have drawn from the Lisbon conclusions is about how to pursue liberalisation by means of directives, while the emphatic reference to the role of services of general interest is at present reflected only in communications and statements. However, we know that guaranteeing equal high-quality access to everyone everywhere requires tariff equalisation to be maintained and a certain number of services to be kept for those providing a universal service. The right to innovation should also be guaranteed so as to take account of changing needs, the consequences of the development of the information society and the fight which may be required to ensure that no one is excluded from this society. I think it would be logical to reverse the burden of proof rather than always have to justify exceptions to the sacrosanct principle of the internal market. It would be more in keeping with citizens’ expectations to restore the balance where public services are concerned by making any new extension to the commercial sphere conditional upon respect for the fundamental objective of the sustainable development of European society.

 Mr President, the debate which followed the presentation of this own-initiative report at last highlighted two concepts, one of which, unfortunately only too prevalent, involves favouring the commercialisation of all aspects of life and aiming to reduce supplementary health insurance to a mere project by placing it in the hands of economic operators and subjecting it to the rules of the internal market. According to this concept, the purpose of the market in profit-making supplementary health insurance schemes is to increasingly and crucially take on the role of supplementing the basic state systems. This view turns up its nose at the non-profit-making mutual insurance companies, which are vital players in supplementary health insurance in several Member States. The other viewpoint illustrated by the rapporteur’s initial statement and shared by a number of members is to promote regulations and codes of conduct which are needed in order to establish among insurers ways of organising costs on a mutual basis providing everybody with guaranteed access to high-quality care and to counter the risk of discriminatory practices developing together with risk and client selection. The report by Michel Rocard, which is being presented today as amended in committee, demonstrates the difficulty of overcoming these contradictions. The amendments we are proposing on behalf of the Group of the Greens recommend that consideration should be given to the following points. Firstly, we have not, unlike some, resigned ourselves to the reduction in the relative share of public expenditure on health. Demographic trends, the effects of an ageing population and increased demand for medical treatment necessitate a public debate. It should be the citizens of the European Union who decide the outcome of this social debate and the volume of funds that must be allocated in order to guarantee the fundamental right to social protection. The increasing transfer of responsibilities from the basic systems to the supplementary health insurance systems is doubly disadvantageous in that it reduces the obligations of these systems, while at the same time weakening non-profit-making mutual insurance companies which reject risk selection. We propose that the report should include recognition of a right to health care for all, rather than simply the recognition of a basic service which is accessible to all. We also propose removing all risk of discrimination or risk selection which would, we believe, result from the legislation calling for medical examinations to be carried out before a supplementary health insurance contract is concluded as provided for in Paragraph 11b.

 Mr President, first of all, I should like, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to thank Anne Van Lancker and congratulate her on the quality of her report both in terms of its content and the inclusive way she strove to work on it. The apparently technical term ‘social agenda’ in fact covers the day-to-day realities experienced by our fellow citizens. We must both respond to the urgent situation and give practical shape to what has been called the notorious European ‘social model’. We have no right to miss this deadline unless we intend to shatter the expectations of all the citizens and the collective movements they have formed, which are the groups most motivated to establish a European Union which is a community of citizens. The issues to be discussed select themselves: we simply need to respond to the urgency of the situation and bring in legislation to match the declarations made at the Lisbon Summit. We must give the people of Europe the tools and the public policies they need in order to fashion their own place within Europe, in order to ensure that their fundamental rights, including social rights, are safeguarded. The urgency of the social situation and the need to defend the European social model call for initiatives that aim to establish rights: the right to an income, the right to a wage, the right to decent pensions for all within the European Union. Implementing the ambitions for society declared in Lisbon calls for an effort on the part of the Community, an action plan to create jobs in services, especially those related to the information society. As far as that is concerned, the directive proposed in the report in order to guarantee the social protection of new forms of working is essential. It is also important to ensure quality in health, an improved social situation, and an improved environment for everyone – the third system – and tax and legislative measures are essential in order to ensure both the economic longevity and the visibility of this emerging economy of solidarity. We support Anne Van Lancker and Mrs Péry when they propose to quickly adopt the 1998 directive on employee information and consultation and to revise the European Works Council Directive. The fundamental notion of the general interest ought, moreover, to spur us all to approve the proposal to include recitals relating to employment in the regulations and decisions on the mergers currently dictated by considerations of competitiveness. These three examples intended to combat poverty, support the development of activities for job creation, social liaison and quality of life, and to improve employees’ rights, should harness the support of a Parliament that is anxious to propagate the dream of a Europe of the Citizens, although these same citizens currently all too often feel that Europe is a machine commercialising all human activity. A number of amendments betray the terror of some of our fellow Members who get their erasers out as soon as they see the word ‘legislation’. Are they going to go and explain to the people of Europe that Parliament deems it necessary to vote through directives to protect investment and liberalise general interest services, but not to define and regulate what has been described here as the labour market? Such a rejection of legislation, moreover, leads to a plain rejection of negotiation. We even have one amendment that goes as far as proposing to eliminate the objective of concluding European collective agreements between the two sides of industry. It is in this area that we can, in our opinion, find the kind of old-fashioned ideas attributed to those who expect a brave new world to spring out of a free market.

 Mr President, when we talk about undeclared work, let us not forget that we are talking about construction workers, who more exposed than anyone to bad weather and accidents at work, and that our discussions concern the outcasts working in sweatshops, deprived of any social status, often including the right to residence. To these people we must also add workers in the new economy, whose working hours, time between shifts, and salaries are subject to the hazards of excessive insecurity and flexibility. In short, we are talking about a form of exploitation in the workplace, which admittedly is detrimental to public finances due to lost revenue from tax and social contributions, but we must never forget that we are talking about the exclusion to which, according to the Commission, between 10 and 28 million citizens of the European Union are reduced. Far from stigmatising these victims, we should be concerning ourselves with a specific type of employer criminality. Lumping together those offering this type of work and those accepting it is inappropriate, even shocking. The report that has been submitted to us is not entirely free from reproach in this respect, and nor, what is more, is the Commission's communication. What should we do? Integrate undeclared work into the labour market or adapt the job market to the existence of these excessively flexible types of work? I fear that proposals consisting of reducing taxes and contributions and increasing the flexibility of the job market will only lead to even greater deregulation of the labour market, at the risk of these precursors of excessive flexibility eventually becoming legitimate. As the report that has been submitted to us indicates, poverty fosters the prosperity of the black economy, obliging employees and the self-employed to accept it. Staunchly fighting for the creation of quality activities and jobs, paying attention to working conditions and limiting insecurity are the surest methods of reducing the attractiveness of undeclared work in all sectors. Measures also need to be taken to prevent certain conditions for sub-contracting and the award of public contracts from leading small businesses or the self-employed to seek illegal ways of achieving the profit margins forbidden to them by contractors. We do not need to regulate less, but rather to give greater resources to the authorities responsible for monitoring work. In some States, the Labour Code stipulates that every illegal contract must be re-classed as a full-time, permanent contract. That would certainly be a very active policy and a strong incentive for the employers concerned to regularise the situation.

 Mr President, the imbalance highlighted in the Piétrasanta report regarding the limited participation of decentralised operators and NGOs shows just how difficult it actually is for civil society to take hold of and take over this development instrument. The report also condemns the fundamental political imbalance between structural adjustment measures and free-trade measures and the other dimensions of the partnership (social, cultural and democratic). Such obvious imbalances stack up, distancing us from the objectives of peace, democracy and sustainable development contained in the Barcelona Declaration. The case of Tunisia, signatory to the first association agreement and the first recipient of appropriations, is an edifying one. In an increasingly overt way, the international partners delight in describing countries involved in harsh repression and widespread corruption, where increasing social instability prevails, as stable and successful. We should be wondering whether accelerated economic liberalisation, in the guise of free trade, is not an aggravating factor in this deterioration. Democracy and respect for human rights must not continue to be officially declared theoretical principles which are ignored in practice. Is respect for these principles compatible with the repatriation of illegal residents even though this represents the very success ... (The President cut the speaker off.)

 Mr President, I would like to reiterate the welcome to Mr Marzouki and Mr Ksila, and in doing so, I would like to show my respect for the tenacity that they have shown in overcoming the obstacles put in their way by the Tunisian authorities in order to visit us here. These obstacles will be familiar to all the democrats who, at some time or another, have sought to speak freely about their situation. This is the fate of Sihen Ben Sedrine, who is being prevented from carrying out his professional duties since his publishers, Aloès, were closed down for having taken on the journalist, Taoufik Ben Brik. Furthermore, his passport is still being withheld. Following the high-school students’ uprising, Taoufik Ben Brik’s hunger strike finally brought into the open, into the public domain, what international human rights organisations and some Tunisian democrats had been saying and writing for several years: the repressive police regime uses harassment, random punishment, torture, imprisonment, attacks on personal dignity, and prohibits people who wish to live freely from speaking, writing, travelling and meeting. Who today can still deny the truth of this or claim that they were unaware of it?  We should be talking about the Tunisian ‘mirage’ rather than the Tunisian ‘miracle’. What good is economic success if it is achieved by force and benefits only one particular clan? What good is the praise of international financial organisations in the face of UN accusations of torture?   The fact that democracy and the rule of law form an essential integral part of our association with Tunisia means, quite simply, that there can be no genuine association without democracy. All those, like myself, who are working for a closer partnership, for a fair association and for lasting cooperation are faced with a difficult challenge: to put democratic flesh on the bones of an agreement signed with a regime which proclaims it in theory but declaims against it in practice. In order to achieve these objectives, we must use the whole legal and institutional arsenal available to us – including, of course, the terms of the agreement itself – in order to bridge the gulf between form and content, words and deeds and between declarations and actual decisions. The fact that this debate, which we have awaited for several years, is now being held, is an achievement in itself. For democrats on both sides of the House, it marks the end of the strategy of polite pressure, which has been as secretive as it is inefficient. Yes, we want a meeting of the Association Council, which was created as a result of the shortcomings observed in the way Article 2 of the agreement was being implemented! Yes, we must begin a process which is well organised, binding, and which signposts tangible and demonstrable progress: a halt to torture, the return of passports and the reconnection of telephone lines can and must be implemented immediately! There must be a precise timetable, which is respected, for the recognition of associations and independent political groups such as the CNLT (the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia), the RAD and the Democratic Forum, respect for union freedom, for the integrity of the judicial system and the reform of the press code. Yes, the European Union must be capable of supporting projects which strengthen civil society and democracy, without being at the mercy of the dictates of the Tunisian authorities! Yes, we must broaden the dialogue to include all the diverse and independent operators in Tunisian society!

Mr Prime Minister, we would like to believe, along with you and the Portuguese Presidency, that Europe should be built as a civilisation whose economic and social prosperity is founded on the cultivation of knowledge, cultural diversity and cohesion, and which plays an active role in promoting a world order that is more balanced, more peaceful, and less fragmented. We would also like to believe, along with yourselves, that there is generally a clear awareness that the scale of the changes that must be envisaged in terms of the qualifications needed to address the new technological challenges facing companies itself brings with it the inherent risk of creating new mechanisms for social exclusion, to cite you once more. We would like to believe this, but we cannot. Why? Because we know that the new economy will, of course, foster the emergence of new jobs for creative staff, for IT staff. We can see the feverish way in which the potential for investors has snowballed and the phenomenon of ‘start-ups’ has developed, but we are also aware of the staff turnover that typifies call centres due to the dreadful working conditions that reign in these new temples of Taylorism, which employ hundreds of thousands of people. We know that over half the jobs currently being created in the European Union are precarious, temporary or perforce part-time, and as a result provide the employee with neither the conditions for self-reliance nor, very often, an income that offers them a decent standard of living. We know that new technologies do not, in themselves, generate greater democracy, but simply greater collective and personal autonomy for those citizens who are better integrated into mainstream society. We know that the privatisation of public services poses a threat to social, regional and local cohesion, and we also know that the Commission is proposing to accelerate this process. We know that UNICE has, on behalf of the employers, publicly shown its colours in the preparatory documents for the European business summit to be held in Brussels in June: the public authorities are requested to remove all social, regulatory and fiscal barriers to the development of business and to invest massively in shoring up demand. Lastly, we know that anyone who claims to meet the needs of the citizens must first ensure their total involvement in public policy decisions. We know all of this. But we have read and heard nothing as regards the incorporation of the recommendation of the high-level group of experts, whose opinion it is that the unqualified economic success of the information society depends on this society being fuelled by the real needs of its citizens, rather than by the demands of market forces in the hi-tech sector. We have heard nothing about support being provided to all practical trials involving the public-minded use of new information technologies by the general public, nor about the role of associations for learning and information being promoted for all sectors of society. We have heard nothing about the possibility of public funds being freed up to promote innovation in the field of products and services liable to improve the quality of life for all. We have heard nothing about the universal telecommunications service being redefined in order to make it possible for everyone to access the Internet under the best possible technical conditions and at affordable rates. In short, we have heard nothing to suggest that the citizen will be anything more than a customer. We have heard nothing to suggest that, over and above the positive and clearly-stated objective of eradicating child poverty, personal autonomy would be enhanced, in each Member State, by the setting of decent minimum wages, which are an integral part of a genuine strategy to end social exclusion. We have heard nothing to suggest that the objective of full employment would cover support for local and regional initiatives, the underground sector of the mutually-supportive economy, the practical and coordinated reduction of working times, or that this objective would tally with strict requirements as regards the quality and durability of these jobs. We have heard nothing to suggest that opting for sustainable development would be a guiding factor in long-awaited growth. We can find nothing in the document from the Portuguese Presidency, nor in the Commission’s strategic guidelines for 2000, that reveals the slightest trace of a legislative programme in the field of social policy, be this to bolster the rights of employees threatened with redundancy or to prevent social dumping. We can but share the concern of the Council and the Commission to see the European Union, after the single market and after the euro, finally equipping itself with a political project that is accessible to all its citizens, but the new governance of which you are – in my opinion unfairly – priding yourselves lacks the democratic and participatory ambition to which nascent European civil society aspires.

Mr President, once again we are being forced by topical social issues to debate and take a stance on the restructuring plans of major European groups. Everything has already been said on this subject. For some of us, everything has already been said on the freedom or quasi-divine right of companies and for others, with whom I associate, everything has already been said on the intolerable logic of short-term profit, on disdain for workers, on both the individual and collective social consequences, on the impact on territories and on the waste of know-how and skills. We are all aware of the fact that restructuring, as we know it today, contradicts the stated objectives of the European Union on employment and social and territorial cohesion on all counts. Under these circumstances, what is important today for us, as European Members of Parliament, when we come to the vote, is not yet again to declaim a few general points, however emotional; in my view, this would reinforce the already widespread idea that the institutions are impotent; what is important is that we use every means available in the European institutions to bring our stated priority objectives to bear on the specific case of the merger of ABB-Alsthom and the closure of the Goodyear site in Italy and draw all the relevant conclusions. 	 From this point of view, what can we do? First, draft a very accurate report on the implementation of the collective redundancies and European works council directives and use all the pressure, warnings and sanctions needed in order to ensure that they are applied to the letter. It is obvious nowadays that the management of large groups are using every subterfuge they can to avoid transparent information and negotiation with their workers. We must not permit that. To claim, as ABB-Alsthom did, that it is too early for talks before the merger and too late after it, because the representatives no longer have the credentials, is inadmissible. Basically, it is patently hi-jacking the spirit of the European works council directive. We must strengthen our legislation in order to close these loopholes; we must reform it and guarantee workers new rights, especially the right to contest the economic justification for redundancies. We must also review the criteria on which mergers between groups are authorised. What does the Commission, and by extension what do we look like, from the point of view of the workers and from the point of view of the social consequences, when the Commission authorises a merger as questionable as that of ABB-Alsthom? It simply looks like it is involved in a cover-up. And if all Community policies are to promote employment and cohesion, how is it that the Commission can forego such an investigation when deciding whether or not to authorise a merger?

 Mr President, the European Union’s employment strategy states that the fight against unemployment is being taken into consideration in European-level policy. This is desirable in itself. It is realistic. For the broad guidelines of economic and monetary policy have a real impact on employment at European level. And it is desirable if we wish to curb the sort of competition which is based on reducing social aspects to the lowest bid and also the growth of inequality between regions and between social groups within the economic Union. European employment strategy, however, in the form in which it has been laid down, has been progressively implemented since the Luxembourg Summit and is characterised by dubious ideological foundations and a not particularly dynamic conception of institutional practices. To hear some people speak, you might wonder why we even need a policy on employment. Yesterday’s debate on macroeconomic dialogue showed this: you might think that a policy of monetary stability would be sufficient. No one has yet proved the validity of the premise that it would be enough to guarantee monetary stability and overall competitiveness for employment to follow. Our last debate in Strasbourg on the subject of Michelin and the restructuring of firms was an opportunity for us to develop our doubts on the subject. Once it has been said that European economic policy should have employment as its goal, once this is laid down in law and is proclaimed loud and clear, without ever checking the validity of the affirmation in a realistic and pragmatic way, then the subordination of the social to the economic is being written in the stone of the Treaties, finally reducing the social aspect to the task of managing each and every one of us in our competition for a place in a labour market which is getting tighter and tighter. The result of this economics-based, minimalist approach is that any debate on the means of creating jobs, running counter to this liberally inspired dogma, is ruled out, virtually prohibited. Is it conceivable that out of twenty-two guidelines on employment, there is not a single one on the effective reduction of working hours. Not one is on public investment. And even the mention of active support for local initiatives on employment is limited and any attempts to examine the quality and sustainability of jobs created are eliminated. We have to deal with the figures. It is essential to bring about a reduction in the number of registered unemployed in a Europe where the number of men and women living below the poverty line is itself not getting any less. Before mentioning the proposals of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, let me express one fear. Some circles in Europe appear to be overcome by a feeling of blind optimism, with their eyes riveted on the upturn in growth and only the officially recorded and registered unemployment figures. A considerable number of political leaders seem to forget that many of the jobs created are temporary, part-time jobs, are not chosen, are generally forced on women, and do not always afford the people employed in this way wages which take them above the poverty threshold. If we do not seriously evaluate the sustainable and qualitative nature of growth, there is a risk that we will underestimate the efforts which still need to be made in order finally to give the construction of Europe a social aspect. This is why we think it imperative to evaluate the success or failure of European employment strategy against the yardstick of the indicators measuring concomitantly the numbers of registered unemployed, standards of living and the quality of jobs created. It is only when we increase job security and reduce unemployment that we can see the European Union as representing real progress for its residents in terms of civilisation. As far as the Greens are concerned, the selection of an ambitious European employment strategy should instigate a number of actions, most of which are currently ignored by the guidelines proposed by the Commission. The commitments undertaken in favour of the young unemployed and the long-term unemployed must be implemented at a faster rate, it is true. Job creation must be promoted by combining a number of policies supporting the development of sustainable activities. It is fundamental that local employment initiatives are favoured, that the cooperative, mutual and non-profit sector is supported by being guaranteed a status, that the third sector is truly recognised, including by means of public financing, this form of economy emerging between the traditional public sector and the profit sector, based on the creation of socially useful activities. Broad consultations and public debate must be undertaken in order to decide upon major public works: public transport networks, energy saving programmes, renovation and construction of housing, projects which create a great number of jobs and which benefit everyone’s quality of life. Finally, working hours must be reduced, that taboo subject, which we are not allowed to discuss in Europe. We must find the resources to specifically evaluate the initiatives to reduce working hours which are being implemented in any case, in an equitable or inequitable manner, more or less across the whole of Europe. And to make real progress, we must really bank on the intelligence of the community. It is essential to implement a policy whereby community projects and unemployed people’s associations are acknowledged. It is necessary, at the very least, to preserve their rights to allowances and grants in full. We urge that you give your enthusiastic support to two amendments contributing towards this, numbers 30 and 31, on which I shall ask the presidency for voting by roll call. Finally, institutional practice must be changed so that we really bank on democratic debate and the commitment of all the parties involved. We must find legal bases at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference for the whole chapter of social and civil dialogue.

 Mr President, we will be very interested in the conclusions of the enquiry that you are going to lead because we are also signatories to this resolution and we made the same observations.  What we have all been saying for a while is that, in fact, the goal being pursued by a growing number of companies who are restructuring is to provide their shareholders with more and more guarantees, and to ensure ever greater profitability for their financial investments. That is why the management of the Michelin Group simultaneously announced the axing of 7,500 jobs and fantastic profits. That is why, as you pointed out, announcements of redundancy plans are always followed by a rise in the share prices of the companies concerned.  This violent expression of scorn for employees and their lives fundamentally contradicts our stated objectives in favour of employment, social and regional cohesion, and the European Social Model. What do you expect the employees who are being made redundant from the Wolbert-Michelin factory at Soissons to think of these objectives and our determination to take them forward? The social desperation that these decisions generate is inevitably transformed into political desperation and this political desperation is a permanent threat to democracy.  That is why the European Union must make its actions match its words and must uphold its commitments to employment and to the right to live in dignity. How can it do so now, at the moment, when it is confronted with the brutal, unilateral decisions of huge companies? First of all, the European Union must unequivocally condemn this type of decision and support the employees concerned. No, Mr Pronk, huge companies do not have the authority of divine right for their decisions. It is the responsibility of politicians to intervene and to say what they think of these decisions.  The European Union must also acknowledge the end of a magical formula that all the European Institutions keep trotting out, according to which growth plus competition would necessarily equal employment and development. This is wrong and has been proved to be so! We will have to draw conclusions from such a statement, in order to bring ourselves to reconsider the foundations of our European employment strategy and of our economic guidelines. We must provide for increasing the power of employees and their representatives in order to strengthen their right to contest the basis for the economic reasons behind their redundancy, which we shall call the Wolbert-Michelin amendment and which we shall submit for your vote tomorrow. It is not acceptable for the definition and the management of the general interest to be hijacked by the economic decision-makers. Neither by bowing down to shareholders nor by injecting authoritarian nationalist populism… (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr Prodi, you expressed the wish to restore the trust of citizens in the building of Europe and in the European Union. Our view is that a great deal of the disrepute of the European Union is related to its inability to fight effectively against the ravages of all-pervading neo-liberalism. The Members here present who have all conducted campaigns in which the debate focussed on the urgency of the social situation and the fight for greater employment, have been elected to ensure real progress towards a Europe of employment. The work programme which you presented today, as you have reported it to us and as it has been implemented for several years now, does not live up to expectations. The Greens are proposing a number of measures on the active, global and massive reduction of working hours, and on support for sustainable economic activities, which are creating employment, in sectors such as the construction of accommodation, public transport, renewable energy. We also think there is an urgent case for measurement and harmonisation of minimum social values on the European scale. We are obviously not unaware of the fact that there is no consensus within the European Union, and within this Parliament indeed, on this work programme and programme to combat job insecurity and unemployment. However, we think it a matter of urgency, and it is a matter of responsibility, to permit public debate on these matters. That is why we are totally aggrieved at the exclusion of the European Parliament from the employment process resulting from Cologne and we formally request, Mr Prodi, that you do all that you can to ensure that Parliament can regain its proper place in this employment process.

 Mr President, while we are now rejoicing and welcoming new Member States to the European Union, we cannot, unfortunately, put the international situation out of our minds. A few days ago, we were profoundly disturbed by revelations in the Press of appalling tortures inflicted on Iraqi prisoners by the American and British occupying forces. Practices such as these can do nothing other than widen the gulf between North and South, between the West and the Muslim world. Nevertheless, they represent a tendency that must be resisted. If this is to be done, the international community must unequivocally condemn such practices; it must demonstrate the firm determination to bring to light, in so far as is possible, the extent to which they take place and to ensure that those responsible will be brought to justice. In particular, we can have no confidence in any enquiry carried out by the governments of the States concerned. I therefore hope that a United Nations commission of enquiry may be set up as quickly as possible and I ask the President of Parliament, the Commission and the Council to work together to ensure that a request to this effect is forwarded to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Mr President, I have an extremely urgent and quite unusual question for you. I have invited Mr Akhmed Zakayev, who, as you know, is Deputy Prime Minister in the Maskhadov Government, to a meeting to be held this evening and tomorrow morning right here. Akhmed Zakayev, as you also know, lives in London, and I have asked the French Minister of Foreign Affairs to speed up the visa procedure. Mr Zakayev has been refused a visa on the grounds that he is facing a request for extradition. Now, you know that the extradition request has already been rejected by the Danish and British Governments and that Mr Zakayev was also recently able to visit the Bundestag in Germany. I am therefore asking you please to intercede with Mr Michel Barnier, our Minister of Foreign Affairs, so that Mr Zakayev and his son, who acts as interpreter for him, can attend the meetings this evening or tomorrow morning, or both, which would be ideal.

 Madam President, I would like to return to the issue of the extra-judicial assassination of Sheikh Yassin by the Israeli Government, which the European Union has vehemently condemned. I wish to express the hope that the European institutions come up with a major diplomatic initiative on this matter, because as we all know, the process will be permanently compromised if we simply tinker with things. I would like the decision to suspend the EU-Israel Association Agreement – a decision that Parliament had already adopted – to be reviewed. I would also like us to look into sending a peacekeeping force that would effectively protect the Palestinian population and a major initiative finally to be implemented to hold an international conference that genuinely kick-starts the entire process.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, concerning the use of low-frequency sonar, I will first of all raise three questions and then, in conclusion, I will make a suggestion. Firstly, as the two Members who spoke before me mentioned, this question has been discussed here, in this House, on several occasions and we have already been told, in particular by Commissioner Solbes Mira, that we needed more information. We learn today that a study has been commissioned by a Danish organisation, but it could end up seeming rather odd that additional information has been so long in coming. In actual fact, if we apply the precautionary principle in accordance with the Treaties, we already have enough proof of serious risk ensuing from the use of these sonars, in particular for whales. This justifies the immediate establishment of a moratorium on their use, in order to collect the necessary information to establish additional scientific proof. Do we really have to wait for the worst-case scenario to happen before we do something? Secondly, we are well aware of the worrying state of fish stocks today, both in Europe and on a global scale. It is not surprising that we have heard that there are elements indicating that the signals sent by these low-frequency sonars affect the movements of shoals of fish, which could carry them to dangerous zones that threaten their very existence. Can we allow ourselves the luxury of developing and using a technology that, when it is tested in peacetime, risks worsening the situation of the disappearance of fish stocks? Thirdly, the EU has taken the first steps towards a common defence policy and also a common arms industry. This will without a doubt impact on European research, industrial policy and the general development of the EU. At a time when our societies are showing a growing demand for environmentally friendly solutions, we must prove that Europe, in pursuing the Lisbon objectives, is capable of being a world leader in sustainable technologies. Will we be able to do so if we are incapable of effectively reacting to the development of the use of technologies that are as suspect as low-frequency sonars? In conclusion, it is imperative, if development is to be environmentally, socially and economically sustainable, that we do all we can as MEPs to influence, with the means available, the basic joint decisions that are being taken in the area of the arms industry. This is why I am strongly calling on Members to support my proposal to conclude this debate with a resolution in our next part-session, here, in Strasbourg. This is the only way that Parliament will have a significant position to communicate to the various actors.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, new Commissioners, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I should first like to extend heartfelt greetings to the Commissioners of the ten new Member States and to welcome them warmly into the institutions of our greater Europe. Hailing, as I do, from a cross-border region, Lorraine, which suffered greatly during conflicts with neighbours and in the aftermath of those conflicts, I am fully aware both of the need henceforth to unite our voices and our strength and of the challenges involved in doing so, yet I am also aware of what we all stand to gain from so doing. This enlarged European Union, this united Europe, or reunited as some would have it, with its rights and a political design finally restored in line with its geography, must establish a new European spirit that is free from the rancour of the past and from the yoke of nationalism. I would urge the new Commission team towards just such a shared spirit of solidarity, and of common responsibilities and common interests. Today, and most importantly, I would also urge your new executive – which is, of course, still in its infancy in terms of its composition – towards a completely democratic spirit, and towards ensuring that the citizens’ voices in our European Community are listened to and respected. It could scarcely be a worse omen or a worse baptism for your college that policies that are disconnected or far removed from what the peoples of our Union are saying and thinking are being proposed, because a shared spirit and a European public have been formed, and expression has been given to them within our European space. The Iraq crisis revealed this in sharp relief when political Europe once again shot itself in the foot through political calculations or strategies adopted in certain cabinet offices. Events, however, proved the European public right. Mr President, Mr Prodi, I should like to thank you most sincerely for recalling the major policy guidelines, which, as you said, Parliament had a share in deciding, and which it often encouraged. I should like to thank you for having again put sustainable development at the heart of the European project, because these political decisions were taken by all of the Heads of State, in agreement with the Commission. I refer to decisions such as those taken in Lisbon and Gothenburg, which must be complied with and enforced. The social environment and the economy are intrinsically linked and our proposals must be geared towards them. Hopefully your new Commission will not miss any further opportunities to speak on behalf of the citizens of our Community. The issue that most concerns them today, in the field of food safety and GMOs, must determine the European executive’s position and the precautions it takes. In successive surveys, the consumers of Europe have become stronger and more determined in their shared defiance and hostility towards genetically modified and scientifically dubious produce. In successive meetings, the Council of Ministers has failed to achieve a qualified majority on this public health requirement. I would therefore strongly urge you not to allow the Council to dump these genetically hazardous experiments onto your Commission, in its current interim period, thereby forcing it to take decisions endorsing such produce. There is no room for any wild scientific notions or leniency towards companies when the destiny and health of hundreds and hundreds of millions of European consumers are at stake, particularly since these consumers have never expressed any desire for this new generation of foodstuffs, the consequences of which are unknown. I would urge the Commissioners, including the new ones, not to authorise genetically modified maize during your short term in office. Today, you have given the unified Europe new faces. When major concerns or convictions mobilise the opinions of your constituents, from Dublin to Nicosia, from Tallinn to Lisbon, please ensure that you reflect them as faithfully as possible. The more democratic our European institutions, the greater will be the respect for our Union on the international scene. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our European Union is enlarging by bringing together, on the basis of its values and standards, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe liberated from decades of communist oppression. This harmonisation from the top down of the political and economic spheres, which is what the accession countries have called for and sought, maintains the stability and prosperity of this European area. Enlargement has, however, brought to light and made us see a new neighbourhood on the edge of Europe. Ukraine is one of the European countries that are working hard to extricate themselves from the negative effects of and practices carried out by last century’s Sovietism. The contrast with a Central and Baltic Europe, that is standardising and restoring rights, highlights the democratic deficits, the multiple restrictions and economic insecurities that remain throughout this new neighbourhood. Of course, this social, political and economic divide between the two poles of the same Europe means that the European Union must, within the context of its enlargement, activate its measures, means and initiatives, and its mutual assistance based on solidarity. This decoupling of the enlarged Union and its Eastern neighbours also, and above all, raises the issue of the European Union’s historic links with its Eastern cousins where Community interest is too restricted to making its border more secure and to its nuclear facilities. Instead of today calling for the Tacis programmes in Ukraine to be stepped up, in order to economically restore some sort of stability with this neighbour, why did we not make our solidarity, our programmes and our budgets more open to them after 1991? Nevertheless, Ukraine fully contributes to the European identity and its government stands by its claim, despite the reluctance of the European Union, to take its legitimate place there. The European Union has a political and moral obligation to the Ukrainian people to set to work to effectively restore the fundamental freedoms to their country: freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of political and union association. It is imperative that the European Union remains vigilant, as regards the places of detention, and that it should also be present at the next elections. However, as the current enlargement shows, there are no better foundations for the rule of law, democracy, human and environmental rights than those in the European Union, and not those on its doorstep. It will be at the cost of a new enlargement: this will be the price we will pay for the unification of Europe.

 Mr President, Commissioner Solbes Mira, ladies and gentlemen, the military junta that seized power in Burma has taken root, benefiting from this Asian region’s regrettably fertile soil for dictators, and also profiting from the complaisance of Western States and businesses. A new peak in violence and repression affecting the suppressed and suffering population of Burma puts this country back on our agenda. This time, however, we refuse to be happy with declarations of principle and verbal condemnations whilst waiting for it all to begin again. The schedule is in our favour and the tools of repression against the oppressors are within our reach: to not make use of them would be failure to assist a person in danger. Two dates come to the fore to finally force the Burmese totalitarian regime to reason and surrender. By next month, 29 April 2004, the European Union common position must be revised. This month, officials of the Burmese junta are to go to Ireland within the framework of the Asia-Europe meeting. This event is as near as it is decisive in sending out a frank and definite signal to this junta. There should not have been any exception to the policy of banning Community visas for Burmese officials and those in charge. What a provocation of counter examples of our founding values that Ireland, currently holding the Presidency of the European Union, can welcome on its soil. What a shame, moreover, that Ireland, the symbol of European success, re-established diplomatic relations with Burma in February. This shows very well that over and above the official and impersonal statements from democracies, the interested parties with their roots in our countries are collaborating with these infamous dictatorships, supporting them and profiting from them. How many years did it take to decide to freeze the assets of Burmese dignitaries abroad? How many mass graves and labour camps in Burma will it take before we refuse to grant our visas to the torturers of this country? This resolution calls for the tightening of sanctions and restrictions targeted against this regime, as well as the immediate release of political prisoners, starting with our Sakharov prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi. All we have done for a long time is ban any trade, investment and partnership that could benefit the leaders of this junta. The Burmese people deserve more than that and so does our enlarged European Union.

 I wanted to thank Commissioner Wallström for her reply. I have no doubt that she is using all the means available to her to try to combat this scourge. Even so, it must be stated that the situation is very serious both in the European Union – the future enlarged Europe – and at world level. Let us also remember that it was difficult to accept this link between health and environment, and that has often been an excuse for doing nothing. Today, it seems to me – and this concerns me a great deal – that Members and the politicians responsible are still looking for excuses not to act and give the excessive cost of investing in the environment as an excuse. I am concerned, Commissioner, because it seems to me that we do not really have our finger on the pulse as regards the health situation in the enlarged Europe. Have you succeeded in integrating the health situation in Eastern countries and our health situation into EU policies? Today, in fact, we no longer need to prove that there are links between health and the environment and similarly between poor health and a poor environment.

 Commissioner Wallström knows full well that hunting raises a lot of passion in France, but I do not want to catch her off guard. I would like to ask an additional question about hunting as it is currently practised in the future Member States, the Eastern countries. Are you aware that hunters from the West, from the Fifteen, go in great numbers to hunt in these countries, because the fauna is still very interesting and there are still major trophies – bears and wolves – to bring back? In terms of the Community acquis
 and the implementation of Natura 2000, do you not think that Western hunters are damaging the wild fauna there, before its time, in search of trophies?

 Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Gahrton on his report, which we, the members of the ad hoc delegation for the elections in Georgia, endorse. I would like to say that, so far as the movement of the countries of the South Caucasus towards democracy is concerned, the velvet revolution in Georgia at last opens up what is, we hope, a promising prospect. This new situation will hopefully draw the European Union’s attention, at last, towards this extremely important geostrategic region and erase the offence that was given when it was omitted from the list of our new neighbours. These countries, which are members of the Council of Europe – a Council that they would like to see as an antechamber to the European Union – lay claim to a European culture and must be integrated as a matter of urgency. There can be no doubt that our Union will reach the Caspian Sea in the future. We must therefore do everything we can to help this region, which is highly sensitive to latent regional conflicts, find solutions and ensure that nothing permanent or consensual is negotiated outside democratic frameworks that combine transparency with the participation of all players, citizens and politicians. The European Union must mobilise all its resources and make maximum efforts to give the South Caucasus this democratic infrastructure, as it has done for other regions, because this region remains a silk road for the European Union. The appointment of the EU Special Representative is certainly a step forward, but it is far from enough. The Union must invest, really give itself the necessary resources and give real resources to these fragile states, so that the secessionist tensions that are causing difficulties in South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Adzharia, for example, will die down, allowing a lasting peace to be established, based on appropriate statutes. That is the only way these populations of the South Caucasus will ever have a future, and we all know that. The development and transition of these small post-soviet countries must be considered not in the light of their present precariousness but in that of the Union’s means and the potential of local resources. Community funding must also be provided to help close the Armenian nuclear power plant in Medzamor, which is in an earthquake zone. A conversion to sustainable, reliable and economic energy can and must be based on renewable energies. The South Caucasus is turning over a new page in its history. This is all too rare an opportunity, ladies and gentlemen, and the European Union has been absent for too long to miss its appointment this time.

 Nothing is more important than the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, because nothing is more apocalyptic than the threat of such weapons, nor more suicidal than their original design. We call for a consensus of parties and nations to rally behind the EU objective of eliminating all such weapons; in particular, we call on the European Council to strengthen the declaration stipulating that the Non-Proliferation Treaty be maintained in its entirety. Only by remaining constantly aware and vigilant will we be able to restore confidence in international security through salutary nuclear de-escalation. That will require sustained cooperation between the EU and its international partners to completely deny terrorist organisations access to weapons of mass destruction and other states access to nuclear weapons. All the EU’s partners, even – especially – the USA, must sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the CTBT, which could then enter into force. Constructive joint dialogue is required with the urban populations and their elected representatives who are potential targets for annihilation. Let us here pay heed to the call by the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for a timetable for eliminating nuclear weapons, bearing in mind the Prepcom 2004 meetings and the NPT Review Conference in 2005. The rejection of the Greens’ amendment, urging nuclear disarmament on the part of France and Great Britain, is regrettable, but we will certainly persevere with this aim.

Regarding the 2004 Spring Summit, the Commission has missed a good opportunity to give its opinion by stressing real priorities that have been neglected for too long, the urgency of which should have been the basis of this resolution. The decay of basic environmental features –
 caused by decades of the West’s unsustainable obsession with productivity, ignoring a number of indicators, including environmental ones – is ever more obvious in terms of climate disruption, a fall in biodiversity and a marked increase in diseases linked to pollution. These phenomena are all the more alarming in that they now appear to be irreversible. They are so globalised that it is imperative that, from now on, they be at the centre of an exhaustive management of Community policies, radically overhauling the specific economic, financial or social dimensions that are now obsolete. The Spring Summit must set the seal on a change of era and recognise the need for energy restructuring where ‘renewable’, ‘sustainable’ and ‘economical’ are the key words. Changing tack from the traditional, overused and toxic approach would open up a new generation of jobs: public service jobs and jobs in the tertiary and social economy, free from the pressures of working hours set in stone, increased job insecurity in certain sectors and outdated discrimination. Symbolising the end of these obsolete patterns of thought and work, a reform of the eco-tax on the basis of an adjustment to tax practices makes a new common economic policy essential, breaking this collusion between economic growth and the use of resources.

 Mr President, Commissioner, today in Iran the conflict between conservatives and reformists threatens once again to throw an entire nation of this great Middle East into obscurantism and fundamentalism, into a pernicious and despairing arbitrariness. More than ever, therefore, and certainly more than in the past, our Community institutions must make their presence and influence felt among the conflicting forces in the Iranian Parliament, in President Khatami’s Participation Front and in Ayatollah Khamenei’s Guardian Council, in order to defend the universality of the values of the rule of law, democracy and human rights. These fundamentals should serve as a basis for negotiations and exchanges between the two factions, without which there is a risk of ending up with a State in which there is no rule of law, and to push that State or to push the cohesion of Iranian society and the geopolitics of this tormented region towards even worse scenarios. The time has come to defuse the Council of Guardian’s attempts to disqualify reformist parliamentary candidates in the forthcoming general elections. In effect, the acknowledged absence of democratic rules and procedural transparency will end up discrediting the political rulers and encouraging their rejection. Those rulers have already succumbed to the suppression of freedoms, including freedom of expression, and they are the cause of the failure of economic and social development. To suppress all the democratic aspirations of the people of Iran, who are already worn down by years of war and revolution, would be to snuff out their last hopes and ideals, leaving the way open to despairing ideologies and extremisms. The mobilisation of the European Union must be a matter of priority and it must be committed and pro-active, and must engage decision makers and all social categories or categories of activity. Any withdrawal, any ostracism on the part of foreign diplomats, would strengthen the retrograde and destabilising forces in a region of the Middle East which is as far from us in geographical terms as it is geo-politically sensitive in our view. Any argument in favour of severing cultural links between Europe and the Middle East should also be rejected. The creation of a special parliamentary delegation to Iran proves this, the signing of the additional protocol on safety controls for nuclear materials confirms it, and the preliminary discussions between the European Union and Iran on human rights should convince us of it. These first signs must support and encourage the European Union’s approach to the Iranian authorities with a view to sending, right now, a party of observers to examine the electoral process and cooperating, right now, in judicial reforms and in the control of drug trafficking. At the present time, history is being made in Iran, and Brussels has learned enough from Munich in the past to be aware that it cannot refuse to make its voice heard now in Tehran.

 Mr President, Commissioner, in its misfortune, Cambodia is once again crying out for help, but the echo of the distress of its people and of its associative and democratic militants reaches us only from beyond the grave. This is now the case with regard to Chea Vichea, the President of Cambodia’s Free Trade Union of Workers and a founding member of the Sam Rangsi party, for whom the main contribution of the European Union will be to salute his memory after his death. However, this trade union leader strove to defend the rights of more than 38 000 of those modern slaves of globalisation working in the textile industries of South-East Asia. The fact that the police or the Cambodian Government did not take action when threats were made against him is understandable, in the light of the collapse of the rule of law and of democracy in Cambodia. The fact that the integrity of such leaders of civil, trade-union or political society is not safeguarded by anything more than the dialogue between the European Union and that region of Asia which is going through severe political crisis is something that we should regard as a challenge. Is it really necessary to point out here that the assassination of Chea Vichea is merely the latest in a series of violent crimes against opposition figures and that 2003 was the most violent year since 1998? Is it necessary to add that none of these crimes has been the subject of any court judgment and that the perpetrators have consequently never been convicted. Against such a background, how can we celebrate the 25th anniversary of the fall of the despotic rule of the Khmer Rouge, when the martyred people of Cambodia are still experiencing such violence and terror? The credibility of our European Union at international level and the emphasis it places on international law and democracy versus the use of force and Realpolitik
 makes it imperative that we should bring together the Cambodian political leaders and make them aware of the urgent need for political and economic reform and ensure that they face up to their responsibilities with regard to the fundamental rights of their citizens. The Cambodian Parliament must take up its duties again, and a serious agreement must be ratified, not a compromise which looks more like a masquerade between the UN and the Government, with a view to creating a special tribunal with responsibility for judging the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge. This is a project, incidentally, which has already been in preparation for five long years. I would also like to point out, Mr President, that it is essential to put an end to the unacceptable, intolerable forced labour involving children, whether it is the children working on the Phnom Penh garbage dump, of whom we are all well aware, or those who are sold into prostitution, or those who are the victims of trafficking in human beings, thereby feeding one of the most vile of all networks. Although it is a matter of urgency, Mr President, that an ad hoc European delegation be sent to Cambodia as an initial measure, we must not forget that the fundamental duty of the European Union is to continue to provide permanent and voluntary assistance to Phnom Penh, side by side with all the people involved.

Mr President, today we are awarding the Sakharov prize to Mr Kofi Annan as a sign of our total support of the UN. This rare occasion also gives me the opportunity to draw attention to neglected issues or lost causes. One of these lost causes is respect for international law, in defence of which Mr Annan has, despite the American bulldozer, brought all his personal qualities and the full dignity of his position to bear. The war took place, admittedly, but, from the outset, it was tainted with illegitimacy and discredited by its motives. The subsequent, after-the-event revelations as to the bogus and false nature of the charges against Iraq must give solace to those who more readily denounce the environmental dangers to our planet than arms stocks conspicuous by their apparent absence. Another voice that has been continually hushed and drowned out is that of indigenous peoples who, although being the last survivors of ancient civilisations attach fundamental importance to environmental values and have a better understanding than ourselves of interdependency. In this world of ours that has become materialistic and superficial, people who have nothing left to defend but their fundamental rights are virtuous and authentic out of all proportion. 
Let us refute this marginalisation of indigenous peoples’ rights and let us make the Union and the UN promise to maintain the working group on indigenous peoples in the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.

 Mr President, it would have been good if, for once, our agenda could have included reference to a happy event relating to an ACP country, namely the bicentenary of Haiti’s independence. When the country became independent, it put an end to the slavery and exploitation of an entire people, which had lasted for decades. What kind of celebrations can there be, what kind of congratulations can we offer to the Haitian government, such has been the downfall of this country, in which all optimism has been reduced to nothing? A vicious circle has dashed the hopes and extinguished the symbol represented by Haiti. President Aristide, previously a torchbearer for democracy, and reinstated by American intervention, has drowned Haiti in the mire of the third world. The country has degenerated into a caricature of the poorest of the poor on the American continent and within the ACP. A collapsed social economy is strangling the population and discouraging local and regional aid, while the black market prospers in the hands of the highest echelons of the regime. The environmental disasters of deforestation and floods have heaped further misery on a desperate people. Giving up in the face of such chaos would be the final nail in Haiti’s coffin. Two centuries of Haitian independence have revealed the resourcefulness, the will and the ideals of the people, who represent the seeds of a rebirth of democracy and prosperity. Condemnation of the current regime and situation, however, cannot hide the difficulties that exist and the abuses committed by countries of the region and of the West, within their framework of assistance. Let us remember that not even the UNDP’s cry has evoked a response that will result in humanitarian aid. The international community’s disarray leads only to a lack of investment of resources and attention. The EU’s cooperation agreement must be capable of adapting to the current situation, in conjunction with regional and international organisations. We must not be daunted by Haiti; rather, we should view it as a challenge and a laboratory of transition for the EU in its cooperation with the ACP countries. While remaining resolute, we must encourage dialogue with civil society, and request a UN mediator to reach a long-term political agreement, in order to help the Haitian people back onto the road to democracy and sustainable development.

 Mr President, I too am pleased that we are holding this debate on the preparations for the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. At long last it gives me an opportunity to remind our European Parliament of its commitments on the question of indigenous peoples and in particular on our institution’s dialogue with those too-neglected peoples and its representation to them. It is my duty, Mr President – and you know what I am talking about – to remind you again of our 1994 resolution on action required internationally to provide effective protection for indigenous peoples, which in fact called for the setting-up of an interparliamentary delegation composed of Members of this Parliament and representatives of indigenous peoples. After ten years’ hard work, the indigenous peoples have for their part succeeded in creating and organising themselves in an Indigenous Peoples’ Forum. On the Union’s side, however, we are more than discreet; I would even go so far as to say we are not present. The proof is that neither the Council nor the Commission have made any reference to indigenous peoples and Parliament itself has still not arranged its delegation. We must remedy this lack of consideration for a question that nonetheless affects peoples on five continents. I shall therefore be proposing that the Union invest its resources and its will in organising the next Indigenous Peoples’ Forum jointly with the UN here in this place and in ensuring that the rights of these populations also remain among our priorities.

 I am opposed to nuclear energy and opposed to the nuclear package. Nonetheless, I wish Mrs de Palacio an excellent year and, above all, very good health. That being said, our Parliament must not be led astray by the Commission on nuclear matters. I am adamant that what we have here is a concerted campaign to misinform and brainwash our populations, who are more and more sceptical about the nuclear issue. The Commission would like to convey the impression that, with the wave of a magic wand, it is settling the issue of the management of nuclear waste, whereas thirty years of research have ended in failure. Nuclear safety in the power stations of the new Member States would be better guaranteed without putting some new standard in place or by proposing to grant loans to the nuclear industry, thereby giving it an advantage over clean, renewable energy sources which have difficulty gaining a foothold. Whereas all opinion polls show that the problem of nuclear waste, some of which – it must be remembered – has a life span of millions of years, is our fellow citizens’ main worry in environmental matters, the Commission considers, in view of its project, that burying nuclear waste is apparently the solution, and this without scientific proof. If, by any chance, the European Parliament were to come out in favour of burying radioactive waste, this would be a disastrous political signal for the inhabitants of Bure in Lorraine, the prime site for carving out in a deep clayey stratum a laboratory designed for testing the reaction of highly radioactive nuclear waste. Without any comparative study and without any democratic European debate on the future of nuclear waste, this decision would give the Bure site its one-way ticket for burying European nuclear waste and would turn it into the nuclear dustbin of Europe. There is still time to respond by asking the Commission to try to come up with something better regarding waste management, both by proposing that waste be stored underground within the power stations and, above all, by putting in place new, demanding standards where nuclear safety is concerned. Finally, a last question, if you would allow me: how does the Commission intend to set about asking France to provide the public with wide-ranging information on the transport of nuclear material, when this issue has been classified as a top-secret defence matter since last August.

 Mr President, climate change, the heatwave, and ecological delinquency: all these phenomena have brought catastrophe this summer, all of them need to be combated at every level, and this report is just one of many ways of doing so. At the end of the day, the amounts at stake are modest and perhaps did not merit all of the political wrangling to reach this compromise. Nevertheless, the Greens are satisfied with the compromise that has finally emerged. In our view, this report could have been settled long ago, but we are reassured because the programme will, at long last, be able to be launched. It could have started as early as 2002. We also wish to remind you that the measures in this programme are transitional ones and that the countries that have not invested in fire prevention would be well advised to do so before the review in 2006. We want the EU to find a happy medium at the next review, so as to strike a balance precisely between the two extremes: the countries of the North, which support subsidiarity in forest policy, and those in the South, which perhaps tend rather to knock on the door of the European treasury when problems arise. Finally, where the projects are concerned, we would ask that one of the factors in the selection process be biodiversity, because although it is true that it is difficult to explain what biodiversity is, we are very well aware of how important it is in the forestry environment. Reforestation, for example, should take the form of restoring the forest biodiversity that was damaged, if not totally destroyed, in the fires this summer.

 After a deadlock sustained by the mobilisation of the public against software patenting, Parliament declared itself in favour of the report. I voted against the directive. This project is useless; there is no justification for it because no one asked for it, apart from the multinationals, who want to hold on to their monopoly! Under the pretext of protecting ‘invention’, patents will eradicate innovation. By voting against this project we are refusing to support such manipulative behaviour. This is because this plan, even if amended significantly by Parliament, is still dangerous. Its very name: patentability of computer-implemented inventions, allows software to be patented. If such legislation had existed at the time of Mozart or Beethoven, authorising the patenting of musical works, then the whole of our world heritage would have been undermined at its very roots. The system of copyright currently covering software should continue to be enforced because this alone guarantees that authors remain justly and permanently rewarded.

 Mr President, I would like to ask what purpose the enhanced Hughes procedure serves. Since this report comes under the enhanced Hughes procedure, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism should normally have drawn up opinions according to the same procedure. This is not the issue we are here to discuss, however. It will be decided during another debate. As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, I can say that rarely has society witnessed such a heated, intense debate as the debate on the Prestige
. Ultimately, here, we are somewhat removed from the disaster. The effect of the Prestige
 disaster on Galicia really was similar to that of an electric shock, and it had the same impact on France and Europe as a whole. Nobody, no citizen, failed to be moved by the disaster, especially after the Erika
 disaster in 1999, when we in this Chamber said ‘Never again’. Mr President, Commissioner, we must answer some questions to which a response has not yet been given. For instance, we know how it happened but we do not know why it happened. We do not know why the Prestige
 was towed out to sea, and the citizens asking this question have the right to know the answer. Parliament and the Commission, however, reacted very quickly. We called for a committee of inquiry to be set up, a proposal which was rejected by the majority of the House, and so we have a report instead, with this enhanced Hughes procedure which, I regret to say, seems not to serve much purpose. Nevertheless, very thorough work has been carried out, with a high level of cooperation between the different contributors and the different Members. On behalf of the Committee on the Environment, I myself, generally alongside the rapporteur, have taken part in all the initiatives which have produced this report, which is relatively exhaustive, the Committee on the Environment having focused on the issue specifically from the point of view of the environment. I will therefore concentrate on four points, four of the Committee on the Environment’s demands: The first concerns the priority of recovering the fuel oil. It is unthinkable that we should let 13 000 tonnes of fuel oil seep out drop by drop: that would be to turn a blind eye to a hidden oil slick which would continue to pollute our coasts for years to come. The second point is the rehabilitation of areas of unspoiled nature. We call for the enforcement of the Habitats Directive and for the proposed Natura 2000 sites to be adopted immediately, and for resources to rehabilitate areas of unspoiled nature, the coasts, the seascape and marine life. The issue of volunteers, Mr President, is also extremely important. We call for an epidemiological study to be carried out on the communities to find out whether volunteers should, indeed, continue to collect fuel oil or not in the event of a problem, etc. I will not go through the entire list of points, however. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like, in particular, to draw your attention to tomorrow’s vote. With regard to tomorrow’s vote, it is not a question of opting for the wrong committee of inquiry: we are calling for a temporary committee that will discover the whole truth and tell us what should and should not be done in the event of a disaster. It is a genuine decision-making aid, a tool to help decision-makers that we are calling for with the temporary committee. A committee on the enforcement of the Erika I and Erika II directives would not be able to tell us these things or bring progress.

 Mr President, Commissioner, those of us who love Cuba and the honest and down-to earth Cuban people are deeply upset to see human rights and in particular the right to freedom of expression persistently breached by President Castro’s regime. The European Union, one of whose aims is to promote universal and inalienable human, civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, can only vigorously condemn this authoritarian attitude on the part of the Cuban regime towards its people who legitimately aspire to fundamental values. The European Union, however, is not entirely in the clear either. Its relations with Cuba can truly be classed as unique. Indeed, Cuba is the only country in Latin America not bound by a bilateral cooperation agreement with the European Union, despite the fact that through some of its Member States, the Union is the main source of business and investment in Cuba. Following the collapse of the Soviet bloc, the Union became the island’s main trading partner and in this capacity, we believe that the Union’s key role presents exceptional opportunities for exerting moral and political influence in order to take democracy and respect for human rights forwards in Cuba. The other unique feature resides in the status of the island within the ACP-EU Joint Assembly. Cuba has been accepted as a Member of the ACP Assembly but remains an observer on the Joint Committee. Cuba is also the only country for which the Union stipulates conditions that must be fulfilled before it can sign the Cotonou agreement. Do we in the Union not have a responsibility to treat countries equally? Cuba should be treated in exactly the same way as any other country. The Union must consequently play a key role where Cuba is concerned. Whilst respecting its sovereignty and dignity, it can work towards achieving a peaceful, internal democratic transition and pursue a policy that could persuade Cuba to adopt positive measures such as signing and implementing the United Nations conventions on civil and political rights. The Cuban people are suffering. They are suffering as a result of the policy of confrontation with the United States after 44 years of the blockade and the Helms-Burton law. It is suffering as a result of an authoritarian regime presiding over a ruined economy and it is in the values of the European Union that these people are putting their hope. The Union must understand this and Castro’s regime must accept this.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak on the same topic. I must express my indignation at a decision taken by my government – the French Government – which has classified the transport of radioactive waste as top secret. This means that informing communities and elected representatives about the transport of radioactive goods is now forbidden in France. All of us here, however, know how dangerous highly radioactive waste is and we are also aware of the concern felt by our fellow citizens about issues involving radioactive waste originating, in particular, in nuclear power stations. In my opinion, ladies and gentlemen, this decree constitutes an attack on our freedom of expression; it runs counter to the European Parliament Resolution on the transport of radioactive goods, for which we voted in this very Chamber in February 2001. This resolution required elected representatives and local authorities to be informed of the movement of trains containing radioactive waste. We also emphasised in it our right to freedom of expression and to demonstrate peacefully when these trains pass. I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to contact the French Government in order to inform it of the European Parliament’s resolution and so that it can revoke its totally preposterous decree. I personally shall continue to inform any colleague or fellow citizen who asks about the movement of radioactive trains.

 Mr President, Commissioner, at this very moment fire is continuing to ravage part of the Massif des Maures in France. Desolation, helplessness and anger: that is how you feel when you cross these areas that have been burnt to a cinder. I know that you proposed the Solidarity Fund on behalf of the Commission, but what can the Fund do faced with the extent of these disasters and the consequent costs? It is whole swathes of the economy that are wiped out. Furthermore, nature, which is already weakened, never stops paying the cost of our inconsistent policies. Who will pay to restore nature, to rehabilitate the Natura 2000 areas that we have so much difficulty in designating, as they are too greatly coveted by frenzied tourist development? And have we not only narrowly avoided further catastrophes, when you think of the water in our rivers that was no longer cooling nuclear power stations; the waters in those rivers into which the French Government, for example, authorised even warmer water to be discharged? It really is high time that this stopped, Mr President, Commissioner. You yourself reminded us of our Kyoto commitments in terms of global warming. What is the Union doing, though, to impose an alternative transport policy or an alternative energy policy? Because this heatwave, as we all know and we have stated this again and again, is a foretaste of the problems we will have to face in the future. Meteorologists are unanimous: we can expect more heatwaves. After these disasters, now is the time for action, Commissioner. Furthermore, as we all know, that is when it comes to the crunch. Even here we do not use the same terms to mean the same thing. Sustainable development, sustainable transport, the sustainable economy: all European policies today are sustainable. In fact, to confront the ecological crisis we need a change of policy, and our policies need to be ecologically sustainable. We need to put in place an environment policy that is not forever seen as an optional extra, as it is today. The environment has to be a priority in the political choices that we make. This is still not the case, as we know. Moreover, we also have the technical means in the Commission – it is not worth describing them here; you know full well – to meet the challenge, but it is the political choices that are cruelly lacking, and this is true no matter what our governments say. Consequently, Commissioner, we really are counting on you to convince the politicians to make different choices.

 Madam President, in France, José Bové is paying for his opposition to GMOs and for his commitment to the precautionary principle with his freedom. This penalty is completely unacceptable, particularly if we compare the threat to society that he represents and the threat to our future health posed by GMOs. We are more aware in Europe than elsewhere that this is unacceptable, because we are obliged to guarantee our fellow citizens the real choice of whether to eat or whether to refuse to eat GMOs. Let us not be intimidated by the lies and pressure piled on by President Bush, who is supported by the pro-GMO agri-food industry and who is denying his own consumers a choice. Let us take the lead, let us dare to close the loopholes in our regulations. We must very clearly refuse to allow non-authorised GMOs onto the market. With regard to the labelling of authorised GMOs, we know that the food industry can detect the presence of even 0.1% of GMOs. This is the approach that we should follow, but having said that, unless there is a guarantee that GMO and non-GMO crops can coexist with one another, the best regulations in the world will be useless if GMOs are present everywhere in nature. This is absolutely crucial if we are to give consumers freedom of choice and protect the environment, maintain GMO-free crops and guarantee that they remain GMO-free. This is the real challenge we face. Let us not be fooled: unless coexistence is guaranteed, there will no longer be any choice.

Will Parliament be heard? That is the question that we should ask ourselves today, the day before the Agriculture Summit in Luxembourg. Having achieved unanimity on agriculture, which should be welcomed, the most important question is whether the Council will be able to grasp the opportunity and incorporate Parliament’s position into its plans for the future organisation of the common agricultural policy. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance regret that codecision does not apply to agriculture. If it did, European farmers and consumers would have benefited so much more from the way that mentalities have rapidly changed for the better: towards moving on from costly, wasteful agriculture that destroys the countryside, towards agriculture that respects men and women, their work, the land and the environment. In short, ecologically responsible agriculture, which the Group of the Greens has always advocated. This reform of the CAP over 10 years is a commitment to a new type of modern agriculture, which takes into account all of the social, economic and environmental realities of the agricultural profession. That is the type of agriculture which is the aim of the agreement reached in this House and that can only be welcomed, although it is surprising how different positions were not long ago.

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is always a pleasure to welcome you to the House, but I too regret that Mr Monti is not present to give further explanations regarding the issues that have been raised. In fact, and I think that other Members here today feel the same, we are not at all sure whether your colleagues, and in particular Mr Bolkestein, have briefed you adequately, and entirely transparently, with regard to their intentions. Those intentions, which I would describe as secret, because we have the impression of not knowing exactly what they are, seem to consist of continuing with the dismantling of the European postal services without going via the European Parliament. That is the matter at issue here: the Commission is acting outside the codecision procedure, in other words circumventing the compulsory route via the European Parliament in order to legislate on the future of the European postal services. I am not going to repeat the many arguments that we have already set out here, on numerous occasions, in order to defend public services and the European postal services, to explain – once again other Members have drawn attention to it ahead of me – the essential role played by the public postal service today in keeping our regions alive. We are sticking to those arguments, because this is the message that the citizens of Europe are sending us and it is our job to maintain that position. We cannot help but take note of the Commission’s reply, but what it says to us is that the Commission has withdrawn its programme for this year. Does that mean that this matter will be transferred to next year’s programme? There is always, as I have pointed out, the possibility that the Commission will go back to its draft following the Green Paper. What would that mean? Nothing is clear! We are certainly not reassured by this, particularly since, as I have just said to you, we are perfectly well aware of Mr Bolkestein’s intentions. It is essential, therefore, to proceed via legal channels, in other words via a European directive that can be discussed here, so that we can see what the Commission’s real intentions are. I should like to say to you, Commissioner, that what is at stake here is respect for the work of each one of us, respect for the work of the Commission and respect for the work of Parliament, which represents our citizens. I should also like to emphasise, once again, because we have the feeling that the message has not been fully understood, that postal services, as Mr Savary has already said, are something that our citizens rely on. We cannot, therefore, endorse any draft which does not go through the procedure of a directive discussed in this House.

 Mr President, the outbreaks of conflict which are causing such suffering in the Ituri region are yet again giving us cause to regret that our plenary debates on Africa are mere verbal condemnations, regrets and formal resolutions about these instances of extreme violence and the terrible toll they are exacting. This time it is Ituri that has fallen prey to an upsurge in uncontrolled barbarism which is tearing apart the Dark Continent, and in particular the Great Lakes region, while the Western media look on in silence. Next time, next session, which other region among these African countries – which are, in spite of everything, rich countries, perhaps too rich in their misfortunes – will be giving us cause to lament? Of course, the lack of democracy and of inter-ethnic dialogue is blatantly obvious in most of the African Continent. The bases for social and economic development and for the establishment of democracy are being eroded by corrupt and clannish governments, supported, in most cases, by Western democracies with vested interests and by our industrial companies. All too often the health and education systems are reduced to the enrolling of the very young into local militias. However, it would be too easy to stigmatise these local regimes, or to let cultural or continental determinism lead us to accept as inevitable the fate of the hundreds of millions of people who still survive on the Dark Continent. Yet again I have to repeat myself before the European Parliament in order to emphasise the European Union’s great weight, resources and capacity to act. The Community has an enormous amount of room to manoeuvre regarding the misery caused by local regimes and militias. It has enormous human resources at its disposal. It should not be difficult for a Union with 380 million citizens to mobilise the necessary forces to secure a sub-continent, a country and, even more so, a region. It has enormous financial resources: the creation of the basic infrastructures necessary for the development of these countries is an essential element in bringing to an end the era of conflict. It has enormous resources in terms of medical and hospital aid, and in terms of political and institutional transitional advice, the key features being, on the one hand, primary care and, on the other, the hope of lasting peace. We need to do all of this if we, in the European Union of which we are so proud, and which has rallied the hearts of our neighbours to the East and served as an example to Africa in establishing its African Union, are not to shut ourselves away, in our own little enclave of well-being, sheltered from the torments of the rest of the world. If the European Union, with its resources, with its weight, or as a member of the United Nations, does not take action, what can we expect of the African Union, or what message can we send to it? We can at least listen to the committed and pro-active voice of South Africa’s President Mbeki, urging support for peace and for the courageous efforts being undertaken by Angola and by those countries which have experienced at first hand the violence and the damaging effects of inter-ethnic atrocities Closer to home, the crisis in Srebrenica has shown us that modern barbarianism is not something that is relegated to other continents. Let us hope that the painful example of Yugoslavia, which is imprinted in our common and Community memory, will give us the necessary impetus to enable us to take massive and immediate action in the Ituri region. Otherwise, how can we say afterwards, to the families and descendants of those who have died in this region, ‘We did not know, we could not do anything’?

 Mr President, I regret the fact that this debate is not to be followed by a resolution, as it is vital for Parliament to send a political signal to the general public regarding this serious international crisis triggered off by the United States’ warmongering diplomacy. That has demonstrated to a ridiculous extent what virtually the entire international community condemned as the real driving force behind this unilateral aggression, as my colleagues in the Verts/ALE Group had already pointed out. These measures, however, cannot be reduced to mere verbal condemnation. In the fact of this global hegemonic power, the credibility, and even the future, of the UN has received a dangerous blow and we cannot remain indifferent to this. It has had a knock-on effect on the political goals of our Community project too, on its attempt to unite the voices of Europe in both a spirit of consensus and international legitimacy. Twenty-four million souls are abandoned to their sorry fate, without even a guarantee that their daily needs will be met. This is indeed a very, very serious hour and a European initiative is urgently required. We cannot content ourselves with becoming a reconstruction agency, although that task is absolutely necessary and urgent. The jeopardising of a potential historic turning point in the international situation has now become more than just a slick, journalistic phrase. The threat is very real and seems to be being overlooked in this Chamber. It is therefore up to this enlarged Parliament, including the observers from the new Member countries, to realise that the European Union must propose a more mature, more long-term alternative in light of the United States’ opportunistic and mercenary calculations. It is up to us to consider, for instance, the legalist voices, such as France, Germany and Belgium, and establish a common, united position. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the UN must be restored to its place at the centre of the international negotiating mechanism.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on environmental liability was the missing link in an effective environmental policy. Given a strong and courageous directive, we could reduce environmental pollution and damage, and make the polluter pay. Will this proposed directive face up to the challenge? After a gestation period of twenty years, the proposal is disappointing, but it can be greatly improved by the amendments put forward by the Greens and the left. For how can we protect the environment while excluding nuclear activities and GMOs? To try and protect and remedy biodiversity with a directive which establishes liability for only 13% of our territory is unacceptable. Yet the worst thing is the hypocrisy of certain Member States on the issue of environmental liability. French conservationists, who take umbrage at the level of the IOPCF payments, would do well to ask Mr Chirac, who takes pride in his environmental charter, to change the position of his government, which is campaigning in favour of exceptions to permits and against compulsory insurance. This is totally at odds with a real environmental policy, because with permits and without compulsory insurance we can expect dozens of disasters like the Prestige 
and the Erika.
 We refuse to accept this. That is why we are asking everyone to vote in favour of our amendments.

 A glance at the troubled history of Europe, full of internecine wars between Europeans, must help us to appreciate the significance of today’s vote in the House on the report on enlargement of the European Union. This enlargement of the Union is best understood as the reunification of the peoples of our continent. At long last all Europeans are coming together to share common fundamental values such as freedom, democracy, solidarity and respect for human rights and the environment. As Members of the European Parliament we should rejoice in having played a part in this process, and commit ourselves to ensuring its success. Nonetheless, we must regret that the budget allocated to this enlargement is inadequate for the scale of the project and for our common future. It is derisory. I would recall for reference that between 1948 and 1951 the United States contributed the equivalent of EUR 97 billion to help Western Europe recover from the devastation caused by war. That amounted to 1.5% of the GDP of the United States. Between 1990 and 1999 EUR 600 billion was invested to finance recovery in the former East Germany. The European Council is only prepared to allocate 0.15% of the Union’s GDP to enlargement. From now on we must demonstrate solidarity as we respond to continental challenges of this kind. It is worth bearing in mind that our future will henceforth be inextricably linked to that of our new friends and neighbours, and that it is up to us to make that future a reality.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I hope it is not because we are discussing industrial desertification that Mr Fischler is here. I do not agree with his analysis, because I consider that the Union possesses substantial levers to influence the businesses subsidised by Europe that are now delocalising left, right and centre. I also think that we cannot constantly leave globalisation on the sidelines because, ultimately, this debate concerns the socio-economic development of the Community as a whole. It raises the issue of European policy, the legal framework adopted in response to the groundswell of globalisation and unprincipled, uncontrolled liberalism. The Union is still the most significant interlocutor and player we have to respond to these global phenomena. This needs to be said and we must not doubt it. What you are proposing will no longer suffice. Many legislative frameworks still remain to be established in order to provide investors in Europe with minimum guarantees, and thus provide millions of our fellow citizens with guarantees of job security and lasting employment. In view of the recent industrial upheavals that have devastated many regions of our Member States, from Portugal to my own region of Lorraine, and that are now affecting the candidate countries themselves, we need to make a clean sweep of this situation of economic non-law and establish a new order between Community bodies and private investors. Having been elected by these specific regions, we can no longer allow the European Union to remain a kind of Wild West for Community bounty hunters who receive public funds in order to increase investment in employment areas and are now shredding our entire industrial fabric by delocalising. Metalworking and textiles are not the only industries affected by industrial desertification. The tertiary sector, businesses with a high added value such as Daewoo and Philips, are also affected. What will be left in future if the European Union fails to tackle its investment flow, if it proves unable to implement a code of rights and duties each time subsidies are negotiated. Once these industrial crises are over, we must learn from them in order to establish clear employment obligations in the area of quality, quantity and durability in proportion with each Community subsidy. You may recall, for example, that, from 1988 to 1995, the Longwy employment area in Lorraine was so badly damaged by the heavy industry crisis that it did not require any guarantees before welcoming Daewoo, even though the company was strongly backed by Community aid. Daewoo is now quite simply and unabashedly abandoning its workforce without any kind of restriction. Although the framework for such aid has since been reinforced, it is clearly not yet sufficient, and neither are your proposals, Commissioner, to restore the confidence of our fellow citizens in European Union social policy and increase control under Community legislation, in order to guarantee social and working conditions in this area we are creating. The European Union must no longer be simply a source of cash, but must now insist, as others have done in the past, ‘I want my money back’, 
to those who would swindle the Community out of its funding. The sustainable development of our continent, which is its only long-term prospect, must be achieved through the threefold social policy of progress, respect for the environment and a regulated, fraternal economic policy. We must put an end to the poor practice of the past, and that is what you are failing to do, Commissioner. Let us now force businesses that have failed to fulfil detailed commitments to reimburse their subsidies. That will be the price paid by Europe, but if Europe is to have a future, it will be at that price.

 Mr President, Commissioner, we can only regret that, at the time of this new resolution on a South-East Asian country, once again our Parliament must condemn an increasingly widespread and serious failure to respect democracy and human rights. Cambodia, despite the promising future that could have been predicted at one time, is becoming dangerously subject to the influence of an authoritarian junta, similar to those in the neighbouring countries of Laos and Burma. Whereas democracy defuses wars, the juxtaposition of despotic regimes here represents a dangerous threat to this entire Asian sub-region. How else can we interpret the crisis that has developed between Cambodia and Thailand, which has led to the devastation of the Thai embassy and Thai possessions in Cambodia and the closure of ground borders between the two countries? This border conflict reflects what takes place on a daily basis in Cambodian society, which is a mosaic of different ethnic groups and cultural and religious diversity and has been harshly and deliberately weakened by the putschist leader, Hun Sen. State violence and all kinds of persecution have recently led to the assassination of Mr Om Radsady, presidential adviser to the national assembly, in the street. Europe must use the many channels available in order to stabilise this country, and the entire region as well, especially at election time. Let us not forget that Cambodia is the main recipient of aid in this region.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, given the situation in Burma, as Mrs Napoletano has described it to us, you can imagine what expectations and hopes this strongly-worded resolution on Burma, which is currently a State with no rule of law, will inspire in Burmese civil society. What fears it should inspire in the military junta currently in power, if this resolution determines the EU’s policy with regard to Burma. Until now, the measures taken by the European Union to improve living conditions in Burma, to try to humanise the situation of its millions of inhabitants, have been limited to theory and political statements that have never been followed by action. The political and moral responsibility of the EU is now involved. Perhaps it should be involved to the point of criminal prosecution. Surely the very significant investments made by the Member States, regardless of any development in the military regime, represent de facto
 collaboration in maintaining the junta in power? Surely European businesses are cynically exploiting the workforce in this prison-State, which has become a general labour camp, where the concept of citizenship no longer applies? This country is certainly far from the European continent and European legislation! Although we are aware of the totalitarian nature of the Burmese regime, however, and the motions for resolution are coming from all sides, the current state of affairs, in other words, the absence of the rule of law, continues under the Burmese sun. We need to activate the European Union’s economic and industrial lever in order to prohibit any investment by the Member States in undemocratic regimes. We need to ensure that the industrial policy of the Member States is a moral one. We also need to use the force of Community diplomatic and political action throughout this Asian region, which has a shared history with some of the Member States and for which relations with Europe are still so important for its development. We must consider the criminals in power in Burma in the current context, in the context of the International Criminal Court that is now permanently operational to prosecute all individuals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The time for theoretical statements has passed. The European Union owes more than that to the winner of the Sakharov Prize and the Nobel Peace Prize, Aung San Suu Kyi, to the 1200 political prisoners, and through them, to the millions of Burmese citizens. This resolution is very strongly worded and comprehensive. Each paragraph should be part of a framework for a genuine Community policy on the military junta, and therefore to the benefit of Burmese civil society.

 Mr President, Commissioner, unlike Mr Maat, we are satisfied that today, by means of this resolution, the European Parliament is sparing a thought for Kazakhstan and, through it, for Central Asia. Although it is true that certain regions of the world are attracting the attention of the European Union, this vast, fragile sub-continent, currently in transition, torn between Russia and China, all too often escapes our vigilance and our requirements. These countries are far from the eyes of the Union, and therefore far from its control. The signals coming from Kazakhstan, however, are more reminiscent of a return to Soviet methods than of a transition towards the rule of law, democracy and a system that respects human rights. How else can we interpret these cases of intimidation and persecution of journalists and the opposition? What is the historical precedent for these fixed or arbitrary trials suffered recently by people such as Mrs Petrushova, Mr Abbyazov and Mr Zhakiyanov? Does the fact that these phenomena are increasingly common not imply a return to the previous authoritarian regime rather than the inevitable ups and downs of a transition towards democracy? More than a decade after the collapse of the USSR, these kinds of misadventures and alibis cannot be tolerated. Although there are still reservations regarding the European Union’s vigilance with regard to these Central Asian republics over the past few years, the Union must now show genuine firmness in order to promote its principles and its values in this region of the world. Tomorrow, certain former Soviet republics will join our Union. Today, already, the Union is concentrating a key economic and industrial force in Europe and the world. It must use this as a political lever to demolish the non-democratic regimes of these third countries that are so eager to obtain Community investment. We clearly have ways of putting pressure on Kazakhstan, on the countries in this region of Central Asia which, at a time of globalisation and the enlargement of the European Union, are no longer, and must no longer, be outside our horizons. We have the power, and it is our duty, to bring the current situation in Kazakhstan into conformity with the international treaties and agreements and in particular with the partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and Kazakhstan. I would like to plead the case of the Kazakh journalist Serguei Duvanov to this institution, as was the case here for Professor Baudajevski of Belarus or Mr Chbih Ould Cheikh Malainine of Mauritania. I would like the European Union to assess political and human rights developments in Kazakhstan.

Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, I must admit that I am a little disappointed, because I expected to see evidence that the European Union had genuinely taken sustainable development on board, but that is still not the case. In Gothenburg, however, the Union had taken a big step in that direction by announcing its desire to measure sustainable development through the Spring Council meetings. Having heard your speeches, I am forced to admit that once again, this Spring Council meeting will not achieve that objective. Sustainable development is not part of the European plan, a chapter among others, as it was portrayed. Sustainable development implies a new approach to all our European policies, which would involve social and environmental issues as well as the economy. My question is as follows: have you analysed the Union’s policies in the light of these new criteria and, in particular, environmental criteria? We would like to know how environmental and social issues are reflected in your proposals. What are the consequences of an economy that we want to be the most competitive? Even more redundancies? Even more damage to the environment? We are aware today of the financial cost of that social and environmental damage. So please, do not make this Spring Summit just another summit, but an innovative one. The European Union will only get out of the current crisis if it changes its policies as the people expect, and only a socially and environmentally sustainable development plan will be capable of restoring the impetus, optimism and confidence that appear to be severely lacking in both the Council and the Commission. If the Union, our European Union, does not respond to the current challenges, both at international level – I am obviously thinking of the issue of Iraq, on which Europe is unacceptably divided – and at the level of European citizens, who are asking for more Europe, a better Europe, then who will be able to?

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU/Chile Association Agreement enacts particularly ambitious, strengthened cooperation. Such intense dialogue should, of course, be encouraged with the greatest possible number of third countries in order to support economic development and emphasise the ecological values and democratic clauses of the European Union. Furthermore, we feel this far-reaching agreement has taken place too quickly, in particular given the impact assessment unveiled at the same time. It is a shame that the impact assessment did not really act as a basis for this association agreement. The European Union negotiations, which are very strong with regard to trade and, in our opinion, excessive with regard to liberalisation, should now also be based, in a balanced manner, around human rights and the environment. Following Chile’s dark history, all our vigilance should be focused on political rights, in particular the fate of the Mapuche Indians. With regard to fisheries, the Union’s interests for Chile should be balanced and only have meaning and a future within the perspective of development and sustainable management of fisheries resources. Let us spare the Chilean fishermen the overexploitation of their resources that has destroyed our own European marine resources. In particular, let us spare Chile from being relegated to the role of ersatz fishmonger for our Community ports. Lastly, we think the scope of this agreement should have given rise to a prior discussion of the same magnitude. This agreement, which aspires to be a model for the twenty-first century, is being dealt with too cursorily. Although the agreement is interesting because it integrates the human rights dimension and consultation of civil society, it nevertheless deserved a more extensive debate on its possible impact, both positive and negative. We submitted an oral question in this regard to allow a debate worthy of the agreement, but the proposal was dismissed. Far from constituting barriers to the implementation of the agreement under consideration, these observations – and we would emphasise this – are an attempt to increase its relevance and durability. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would like this twenty-first century agreement to become a beacon for a new kind of trade based on fair trade, respect for the environment and human rights.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the subject for debate here is not simply a report on the transport of the future. This is, in fact, one of the last ways out following a generation of production and mobility that has burnt itself out. Who would still dare to speak of disaster-mongering or ill omens of charlatan ecologists on the environmental state of our planet, in the face of WHO studies which estimate the number of deaths caused by automobile exhaust emissions at 800 000 each year. There is nothing we can do now other than try to curb the existing phenomena of environmental crisis. What was urgent in a Union of Fifteen now becomes an imperative before a Union of Twenty-five, and any transport policy that failed to include the sustainable development aspect would be entirely ineffective. The threats to our lifestyle are forcing us to instigate a genuine revolution in transport culture. We have certainly realised this rather late, but now we are, at last, able to separate increases in transport volume from economic growth. Far from previous traditions, this new transport deal should include environmental requirements first and foremost in its studies, place the transport-using citizen at the heart of its definitions and liase with NGOs in all of its deliberations. Increasing urbanisation must go hand in hand with improving public transport. For each new project, opportunities for intermodal connections between networks that already exist or are planned should be prioritised. Furthermore, we must not oppose this new deal on transport in 2010 with financial quibbling. An ambitious Community research and development programme must be carried out to counter noise pollution and harmful emissions in the transport sector and achieve the objectives of the Kyoto protocol. In its report, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy raised the issue of the impact of these kinds of pollution on human health. Alarm bells are ringing everywhere, but that is no reason to simply announce that disaster is looming and cannot be averted. We have progressed from realisation to warnings. Now we must act. Far from giving up, Commissioner, in the face of the ecological disaster that is forecast, the Union must change direction with regard to transport and require all agreements and programmes, and heaven knows there are many of them, to comply with environmental criteria. Otherwise we are heading for a fall, with full knowledge of the facts. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, knowing how important and irreplaceable this 59th session of the Commission on Human Rights is, we must not allow its work, its functions and its presidency to be weakened. Who other than the Commission on the rights of men, women, children, minorities, etc. could demand reports on countries that imprison people for crimes that they have not committed? I am thinking for example of Mr Bandajevski, whose health is deteriorating in prison in Belarus; I am thinking of Lemine Ould Cheikh Melaïnine who is wasting away in a Mauritanian jail. We must give all of our support to the proper functioning of this Commission so that it can fully play its role. For this we need to ensure that an appropriate amount of speaking time is granted to the Commission rapporteurs and humanitarian NGOs who, on the ground, are often the real witnesses and representatives of those without a voice. The debate is also the opportunity to highlight the rights of indigenous peoples as, when too many States are violently breaching fundamental rights, what can be said about the rights of indigenous peoples in the absence of practically any information about their definition or their legal guarantees? We must strongly support the UN’s initiative to have a permanent forum on these issues in order to raise awareness and promote the cause of indigenous peoples. We must also do everything we can to ensure the maintenance of the working group, which is the only one of its kind dealing with indigenous peoples' issues. Also, ladies and gentlemen, it would be to the European Parliament’s credit if it, for its part, were to set up the European Parliament indigenous peoples' delegation that was decided upon when a resolution was adopted in 1992.

 Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to raise two points which, I would say, concern me, in your statements. The first, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is that you have not really developed your project on maritime safety. I hope that we will not have any unpleasant surprises, since, as you know, European citizens in both Galicia and France are impatiently, not to say desperately, waiting for Europe to come to their aid, to establish strict rules, clear rules, to ensure safe maritime transport and to prevent pollution. We know, of course, how worried Greece is about this area; we therefore wonder, for example, if it would support the creation of a unit of European coastguards, a ‘Green Berets’ force to organise the volunteers, which was so sorely lacking in Galicia. Would it impose the designation of ports of refuge? I shall stop the list there, Mr President. The second subject that concerns me is the Spring Summit. There again, it is with regret that I would like to say – and I am also addressing the President of the Commission – that you are missing the point, because the Spring Summit had a specific aim, to measure progress made or ground lost in the field of sustainable development through the policies of the Union. The summit you are preparing for is nothing unusual, and yet there is urgency. I shall only give one example: will the Union continue to provide financial aid to multinational companies with nothing in return, without ensuring sustainable employment for employees? I am of course thinking of the Daewoo workers in Lorraine, France, who are once again out of a job while the Union and the region of Lorraine had banked on this restructuring, granting considerable financial aid. This is the opposite of sustainable development. What I would therefore like your spring reports to do is present genuine policies which take account of the environment in order to avoid destroying it and which also create truly sustainable jobs.

If, following the floods that engulfed Central Europe this summer, the earthquakes in Turkey, Greece and recently in Italy, there were still a need to demonstrate the necessity of an aid fund for victims of disasters, the news of the sinking of the Prestige
 should finally convince us. Although this Solidarity Fund is a necessary guarantee, it is not a sufficient one, however. Providing aid to the victims of such disasters should not prevent detailed consideration of their causes, our production methods and economic orientations. On the contrary, it should encourage us to radically question our economies of profit! These economies produce small profits for shipowners registered in Panama, recruiting Filipinos and flying the flag of Gibraltar! But personal and family tragedies, incalculable losses for the European and international communities caused by each sinking of an illegal tanker, destroying the socio-economic fabric of the coasts for years and damaging ecosystems and marine biodiversity for centuries! What I am calling for is more than a solidarity fund, but the creation of a European bank for environmental protection and restoration, which is permanent and one step ahead of environmental disasters, so that the recent Prestige
 disaster is the last warning shot for these attacks on the environment.

 Mr President, Commissioner, this is an exceptional day for the nations of Europe, for we are undertaking – during peacetime – a process of enlargement, nay, of reunification which could not have been contemplated during the last century. It is a unique moment and an opportunity for everyone, members and future members of the Union alike, as Europe's history and diversity enshrine some fundamental values. Europe is at a crossroads. It has a larger population, it is more powerful and has more solidarity – it can still change world order. This Europe is capable, as long as it has the strength and the courage to do so, to put the individual back at the heart of the planet, to integrate the social and environmental dimension in all its decisions. The plan for sustainable development based on solidarity must be affirmed as the Union’s objective. Together we will succeed. Europe will be what we make of it: either an average power, entrenched in its egoisms – the egoisms of nations that have provided the countries involved in enlargement with only EUR 25 million whereas the Marshall Plan granted them EUR 97 million, or a Union promoting its political, social and environmental values. For my part, ladies and gentlemen, I believe in the future that we are shaping, particularly with regard to the considerable efforts on the part of the candidate countries. It is our turn to put our words into action.

 Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that I am from the Lorraine area of France and I would also like to pass on my condolences to the families affected by the rail disaster. I would also like to reiterate that I remain a fervent supporter of the railways. Commissioner, my first point relates to the nuclear industry. I am rather surprised that we were able to read the various proposals you have outlined in Le Monde
 before you came to present them to the House. This is a matter of some regret, all the more so because, personally speaking, I am far from convinced – and I have the impression that you yourself are far from convinced – by a number of your proposals, particularly your proposals regarding deep land disposal. You are well aware that this is a key issue. You know that, for the time being, no solution to the problem of waste management has been found, that there are currently no techniques which will enable us to reduce the radioactivity of radioactive nuclear waste. And yet, in 1974, when France launched its major nuclear energy project, anyone who would listen was told that, in thirty years’ time, these waste problems would be resolved. Today, 30 years later, these problems have still not been resolved. For my part, I feel that your proposals are – to an extent – misleading the public. Ultimately, you are trying to suggest that, with these decisions, you are going to make nuclear energy in Europe safe. Yet this is completely untrue. Lastly, Commissioner, how do you justify the fact that further financial assistance is being given to the nuclear industry – when, for example, the nuclear industry has already cost the average French citizen a great deal of money – and when no solution to the problem of waste management has yet been found, and when we know how difficult it is to find even limited resources to spend on renewable energies?

 Mr President, Commissioner, whilst there is genuine cause to welcome the question and the resolution tabled by Mrs Jackson on the Union’s position at the New Delhi Conference on Climate Change, the fact that the report has been tabled so late leaves us with some doubts as to its real aim. So, ladies and gentlemen, how should we interpret this debate, which is being held after the opening of the Conference, if not as a sign of political and psychological immaturity in the face of the reality of the threats to our world posed by the upheaval of climate change? We must ask ourselves whether the latest UNEP report, which revealed that USD 150 billion is spent on environmental damage each year, escaped the scrutiny of certain European visionaries. Do not worry, ladies and gentlemen of this House. I do not mean you. Commissioner, how do you intend to convince your fellow Commissioners of the urgent need for practical measures? In New Delhi, what we actually need to do is to increase the international reaction to the threat of climate change a little more. This momentum, which the European Union harnessed to implement the conclusions of the last Earth Summit as fully as possible, must be maintained with a view to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, as defined at Bonn and Marrakech. The European Union must continue to be a driving force in combating climate change. At New Delhi, we must also pave the way for the second period, as you have said, and prepare to address requirements which are more pressing because of the gravity of the situation, and we know that time is of the essence. There are three essential points we must uphold in New Delhi. Firstly, as regards carbon wells, which distort the true environmental picture, scientific rigour and objectivity exclude this simple solution, this expedient. Secondly, it is imperative that the surge in air traffic and its impact on the increase in greenhouse gas emissions are included in the process. What is the Commission’s current view on this? Thirdly and lastly, the COP 8 must not fail to condemn the attempt to include nuclear power as a renewable energy, for nuclear power is limited and even obsolete. For example, Amendment No 15 to our resolution, seeking to reinstate it, must be rejected. There is no more urgent subject for us and our debates than the potential future impact of climate change. There is nothing more essential in politics than the very essence of all politics: the continued survival and proper functioning of the Earth itself. We must act now to give ourselves the chance of a future.

 Mr President, Commissioner, as you – and also my fellow Members – have already said, the issue of elephants will once again be discussed at the forthcoming CITES meeting. If we move elephants back into Appendix I, at the request of India and Kenya, will this be enough to prevent these animals from tragically becoming extinct in some countries of Africa, even though their numbers are on the increase in other countries? Opinions are divided. The MIKE system that has been set up, which is highly sophisticated, has not yet provided, and will not provide, according to a number of specialists, a satisfactory answer. It has, in fact, absorbed a substantial amount of funding which could have been put to better use, had it, for example, been spent on ways to combat poaching or on the training of keepers. Elephants are poached for their ivory and their natural habitat has been considerably altered and reduced. Even if their use is authorised, whatever the precise and restrictive framework that might be decided upon, there is a danger that poaching will once again become widespread and that this, in the long term, will led to elephants becoming extinct in some countries of Africa. The European Union must therefore very firmly reject any unlawful resumption of the trade in ivory. At the same time, what lesson could we have to give the local populations who would levy a reasonable tax on their fauna, when we ourselves, in France for example, are incapable of providing adequate conditions for the survival of bears in the Pyrenees or rare wolves in the Alps? By way of comparison, we welcome the gesture made by Cuba, which has withdrawn its request for the use of turtles and, in parallel, the European Union has a duty to reject the request, submitted by the Cayman Islands to breed green turtles in captivity, which could facilitate the illegal trade in these animals. The desire and the need to safeguard biodiversity on the planet requires the adoption of tough and proactive decisions which must not allow any loophole for traffickers of any kind, whilst enabling the local populations to use their natural resources, including fauna, in a sustainable manner, even if this may sometimes be akin to attempting the impossible.

 Mr President, with respect to the floods, it could be said that, in times of trouble, you find out who your friends are. This old saying might illustrate the attitude of the European Union towards those affected by the floods, which have devastated Member States and candidate countries. By reacting swiftly, by dispatching representatives to the affected areas and by agreeing to make available financial aid, the Union has boosted its Community policy and its closeness to the people. The Union has proved that it can show the solidarity expected of it and which we work to achieve. Although we can welcome the commitment to set up an assistance fund for natural disasters in the Union, we must certainly bear in mind the causes of this unpredictable weather. Scientists throughout the world are all telling us that global warming is irreversibly changing the way we live and greenhouse gas emissions are only serving to make these disasters worse. On one side of the planet, we have to sell livestock due to a lack of water and fodder. Elsewhere, entire regions have been devastated since July due to thunderstorms. Incidentally, Mr President, let us reiterate that, in Nepal, 422 people have died and 173 people have been reported missing. In Russia, 50 people have lost their lives and 100 have been reported missing. In Mexico, torrential rain has cost 21 lives and 15 000 people have been affected. In Asia, 250 people have died this year. Millions of homes have been affected by the rising water levels. Unfortunately, as we know, these geographical areas do not have the opportunity that we have here to provide victims with solidarity. Although Members can welcome the fact that aid has been granted and emergency measures have been taken swiftly and effectively, it is not enough to call for the application of the Kyoto Protocol, we must do much more than that. We must integrate the environment into all our projects, into all our policies so that we can create a glimmer of hope. We must lead the way in trying to slow down climate change. The Rio Summit brought little in the way of results, so it is up to us to lead by example!

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Union devotes particular attention to the area of freedom of expression and fundamental rights. Strict observance of these rights is an essential condition of our association agreement. The Euro-Mediterranean partnership cannot be strengthened, therefore, by denying this indispensable and irrevocable clause. Since 1981, Egypt has been under 
an emergency law which grants extensive powers to the authorities, with a total disregard for human rights. Freedoms are increasingly restricted and subject to the tightest control by the police authorities, which are approved by the judicial authorities. Saad Eddine Ibrahim and his colleagues from the Ibn Khaldoun Centre have been sentenced on the pretext of misuse of funds or 
of procedures, but the real reason for this is that they are defending democratic freedoms, as Nawal El Saadawi or other human rights activists have done in the past, whilst individual freedoms are also flouted, several homosexuals having been sentenced. We therefore urge the Egyptian Government to put an end to the emergency law to allow all citizens to fully enjoy their lawful rights, to allow sexual orientation, freedom of religion and freedom of opinion to be expressed without being equated to crimes and to allow the freedom of association to be guaranteed so that civil liberties campaigners will no longer be persecuted. We want the State of Egypt, like the other States which have signed the association agreements, to understand that the democratic clause in Article 2 is not a luxury, nor is it an option. We want our friends to know that we are not interfering, not acting out of a notion of superiority, nor a wish to preach, but we are in fact acting out of duty, a duty to denounce and condemn violations of freedom wherever they occur. Human rights are universal and transcend all borders.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the African continent, which, for far too long, has been synonymous with tragedies and loss, recently wanted to present a new face to the international community. The foundation of the African Union as an off-shoot of the OAU and as a role model to the European Union is a promise of the future for this continent and a homage to the institutions that make up our own. As well as providing a model of political structure and a single project for the continent, the European Union must also protect the rights recognised by the international conventions. The tragedy of another age, however, currently being suffered by Amina Lawal, is threatening all these promises and signatures ratified by her country, Nigeria. The extreme distress experienced by Mrs Lawal and Mrs Husseini before her and so many other ignored voices, is evidence of the ludicrous gap between commitments and political and legal practices in certain countries of Africa. It is difficult to understand that, in this day and age, a sentence of death by stoning could be passed down. It is difficult to accept such a barbaric act could be carried out for the mere fact of having had a baby after a divorce. Above all, it is difficult to accept regional laws, in a federal state which denies and flouts a national constitution. Admittedly, it is the primary responsibility of the federal authorities of Nigeria to establish conformity and respect of its national laws and international commitments throughout its territory and the jurisdiction of its state. However, it is also the moral and political duty of the Union, many of whose Member States share a common history with the African continent, to oppose criminal abuses, such as certain interpretations of the Sharia law and to support, using every effort and every means at our disposal, those who are fighting for the rule of law, for rights and for real justice for all. If we are satisfied with a token statement each time a Kafkaesque crime befalls a citizen of the ACP countries, we are essentially becoming accomplices and are upholding, due to our diplomatic inertia, the return to obscurantist ways. That is why my group and I are calling for a working group to be set up on the question of Sharia law and women’s rights as part of our forthcoming ACP-EU delegation. The stability of Nigeria is under threat and the stability of the whole country could be affected by what is happening in Nigeria, the most densely populated country in Africa. The shockwaves created by Amina Lawal’s case have just reached Europe; let us take action to prevent further shockwaves in the future.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it now seems that the regeneration of Angola and its people has taken on a positive and long-lasting character – in the same way that the tragedy caused by this conflict was appalling and endless. Three decades of hatred and barbarity have devastated an extraordinarily rich territory and natural environment, ruined Angola’s national infrastructure and annihilated, physically and psychologically, an entire population. Given the virtually unprecedented extent of the tragedy suffered by a country situated on a continent that has already seen so much bloodshed, and in the light of the renewed optimism emerging in Angola, the European Union has more than a role to play – it has a real duty, a historic duty, that it must perform. The EU has an extremely urgent humanitarian duty, first and foremost, to increase security in a country that has been deeply scarred at every level by bullets, famine and mines. But the EU also has a moral and political duty over the long term, which it must assume immediately in order to strengthen the fragile civil and religious peace that is being restored in Angola. It also has a duty to resurrect a still liberated economy and to restore a transparent democratic system within the institutions. On the scorched earth of Angola, which has such abundant mineral resources, the European Union, with its experience, its technical and financial resources, can assist in the emergence of a new model in Africa, that of a model of national recovery which needs to be based primarily on the education of its citizens, achieved through knowledge gained from schooling, from the respect of civilian values and citizenship and the requirement for democracy. This period also marks a turning point in terms of the economy. We should rethink and relaunch a development model that is based on the fundamental resources and sustainable and renewable potential. It is on these conditions and these alone that an economic development strategy will be credible and have a bright future. Oil and diamonds will not always be in demand in the economy, the authoritarian policy of colonialism cannot go on, nor can the industrial exploitation of Western businesses continue. Angola’s sudden and promising recovery has taught despairing Westerners an unexpected lesson. It is up to our Union, the European Union now to provide Angola with its experience and its support in writing new pages in its common and turbulent history.

The European Parliament has just taken a great step forward in responding to the wishes of European citizens, who are concerned about the impact of the presence of GMOs in their food. By voting for Mrs Scheele’s report, Parliament has clearly stated its demand for the labelling of all products containing GMOs, including products such as chocolate, for example. The Greens regret, however, that, although animal feed will be labelled, the final product, the meat, will not. That is the only blemish in this report. Although farmers can choose non-GM feed for their livestock, consumers will be unable to determine whether or not their meat comes from GM-fed animals. It is regrettable that Parliament did not follow this legislation to its logical conclusion. Nevertheless, the Greens welcome this move by the European Parliament towards greater comprehensibility, which will enable consumers to choose freely between products that contain GMOs and those that do not.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is always difficult to give an explanation of vote in these conditions. In relation to the Savary report, we do not think that the European Parliament has made the right choice, even though Mr Savary’s report was extremely interesting. We, the Greens, believe that the votes delivered by Parliament today alter the very spirit of the proposal for a directive on which the Savary report is based. The Greens are in favour of harmonising transport, but on the condition that this harmonisation improves the situation in Europe, which is what our fellow citizens are demanding. This sort of harmonisation requires more social measures and greater consideration to be given to the environment. And of course, we, the Greens, believe that harmonisation will only be worthwhile if we also have a genuine transport policy with, I stress, an intermodal transport system, which integrates environmental costs into infrastructure costs, a social regime for road workers, as well as harmonisation for road hauliers. The Greens also believe that the free movement of goods is not currently under threat, because, ladies and gentlemen, if we cannot drive on roads and motorways at the weekends, we can still travel by rail, which is open all weekend, and we can still travel by sea, and by waterways. Of course, we, the Greens, have placed our hopes in this harmonisation and this draft directive, particularly with Amendment No 13, which fulfilled citizens’ expectations, particularly as far as greater road safety is concerned, taking greater account of the quality of life; this harmonisation also left Member States with the option of introducing additional restrictions, which is still in line with what we hope to give to our policy in this area. Lastly, as far as the amendment on flowers is concerned, again, we, the Group of the Greens, believe that it is absolutely scandalous that this amendment has been passed, because, ultimately, it is one of a long list of Trojan horses. We believe that, once we agree to an exemption for flowers, other exemptions will inevitably follow. Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out to you that all our transport policies stipulate that we must reduce road transport. We have missed the opportunity to do this today.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as it has been nine months since the disaster at the AZF factory in Toulouse, we could have come to a decision on a new directive which we could have called ‘Toulouse I’, as was suggested in October 2001. Since we do not have a Toulouse I, we shall have to make do with Seveso II and its revised version. However, we do not want to throw out the baby with the bath water either. According to the results of the inquiry, the AZF factory did not comply with the regulations required under Seveso II. It is therefore difficult to come to any decision as to its effectiveness, and it is because the Greens are willing to ensure maximum safety on high-risk sites that we support Mr Lisi’s report and congratulate him on it. It actually improves upon the revision proposed by the Commission, and amongst other things it will give us a better grasp of the issue of ammonium nitrates. One very positive point is that the new classification will increase the number of sites falling within the scope of the Seveso Directive. We are also seeking support for Amendments Nos 49 to 55, and particularly the last two. Amendment No 54 will make it possible to extend the safety margins around new high-risk installations, to include, amongst other things, apartment blocks, transport routes, industrial buildings and recreation areas. Thus amended, the revised Seveso II Directive could be a valuable tool in the management of the territory of the European Union. The second amendment which I should like to defend concerns the calculation of appropriate minimum safety distances between future buildings covered by the Directive and the sensitive areas listed in Paragraph 1. We believe, in fact, that it is essential that the Commission should, within three years, submit a methodology designed in conjunction with the Member States, in order to establish this minimum safety distance. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to remind you that the French Government decided, yesterday, to re-open part of the AZF factory in Toulouse, despite the fact that the public is campaigning to have it moved away from residential areas. When the amended Seveso II Directive becomes applicable, AZF would be closed on the grounds that it had not applied European legislation. The European Union would then be in line with the public and its safety demands.

 Mr President, the European Union’s commitment to human rights and vigilance in their defence must shape all our Community policies. As the world’s leading economic entity, the Union can exert a powerful diplomatic influence on human progress, especially in the poorest countries that most frequently breach these rights, but which are most often victims as well. In fact, these countries, which have suffered unbalanced and desperate economic and commercial foundations for far too long, are fertile breeding grounds for human rights violations when a cultural or religious wall of silence which single-handedly seeks to justify tradition or customs condemns more than half the population, namely women, to innate and eternal inferiority. We speak of ‘the rights of man’. We should in fact say ‘right of the human person’, since we must be aware that when men are persecuted, women are always treated even worse. We only have to cast our minds back to the barbaric events not so long ago, when two Nigerian women, in a parody of justice, were condemned to death by stoning for adultery. These cases, which received extensive media coverage and had fortunate outcomes, must not hide the extreme distress of other women, a whole population of which, in the Islamic Republic of Iran, for example, are held prisoner by laws and customs that are based on the inequality of the sexes. Segregation and genuine State terrorism govern and shape the lives of women, if they do not decree their death through savage practices such as stoning. Human rights also grant this recognition of individuals, sexes and peoples. Parliament would do credit to these rights and its democratic ambition by recognising aboriginal peoples, as has been possible since a United Nations permanent body on aboriginal issues was set up, and by establishing a delegation to deal with these issues, which is what we voted for in 1992. We need more than declarations and resolutions, we need practical action which must promote human rights.

Mr President, Commissioner, the only reason the voices of these two women, Safiya Hussaini and Hafsatu Abubakar, have reached this Chamber today from the distant regions of Sokoto and Katsina in Nigeria is because their situation is the very epitome of all that is unacceptable. Guilty of having given birth as divorcées and condemned to the most horrible of deaths, by stoning, Mrs Hussaini and Mrs Abubakar are guilty of being women in a region which fundamentalist Koranic or Sharia law has stripped of all semblance of humanity. The citizens of certain regions of Nigeria bound and gagged by obscurantist customs are the victims not just of moral regression but also of the regression of civilisation itself. We have heard the voices of these victims. Thanks to us and because the entire international community has been moved and motivated, the authorities and national courts in Nigeria have pardoned these two martyrs to religious fundamentalism. But how can we possibly think that these efforts suffice, when these precepts of times gone by, which victimise and condemn millions of citizens from the day they are born, continue to apply? The federal state of Nigeria condemns these practices and these courts through its constitution and its international undertakings. Now it should prove that actions speak louder than words. In doing so, it could take on the role and set the example which the calibre of its democracy and its transition to democracy have conferred on it within the African and international community. If it effectively restores the rule of law and demonstrates intransigence in the face of ethnic, sexist or religious intolerance, Nigeria should be able to continue to benefit from Community aid. If all Nigerians recognised the primacy of human rights, and of course women's rights, over any religious precepts or principles, the European Union would respond by providing full support in a spirit of solidarity for the democratic and economic reforms under way in Nigeria.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for far too long, life in Angola has smacked of caricature, a caricature of a country which brutal decolonisation left high and dry, of an African country torn apart by endless civil conflict between fratricidal factions and of a civilian population wracked by poverty and sorrow, scratching a living on land overflowing with oil and tramping barefoot over diamond mines. However, having been reduced to a pathetic caricature of a country, with its people living a life of hell on earth, hope came to this long-suffering nation the day after the Unita rebel leader Jonas Savimbi was shot to death. The new dialogue, set up immediately between the government and Unita representatives and born of a common will to restore peace, has the support of the entire international community. This promises to be a turning point in Angola’s history. Angola could become a model of national reconciliation, normalisation and return to the rule of law. In a word, it could bring its people back to life. Angola has acquired the resources and is making the efforts needed to reunite its people and remould its society. Nature has given this country sufficient resources and wealth to deliver it from need and give it the best conditions of life on earth. It is by counting on us and on action by the entire international community, especially multiple support from the Union, that Angola will be able to assure itself of a future. The Union can no longer use the excuse of danger from armed forces and can now send food aid to the starving population. There is no country more in need or more willing to follow the democratic rules and respect for human rights suggested by the European Union. What better example than our European history to avoid the horrors of neo-colonialism in Angola and lead the country, in transparency and independence, towards sustainable economic development and the emancipation of its people.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we will not be able to say that we did not know about the tragedy unfolding in Chechnya. We are receiving cursory reports from the second war waged by Russian federal forces in Chechnya, based on the terrified accounts given by refugees and reports by the last journalists who were on the ground, that systematic violence and heightened and vengeful acts of barbarism are being committed. Once again, we will not be able to say that we could not help. Russia is no longer an autarchic state, conducting its affairs behind closed doors and determining which Russians have a right to live or die. Russia is linked to the European Union and, consequently, to other parts of the world, through moral and political undertakings, on which its credibility and reputation on the European and international stage depend. One of these undertakings is the European Union’s common strategy on Russia and the cooperation and partnership agreement compelling Russia to respect human rights. Russia is supported in its difficult transition towards achieving Western economic standards by means of programmes, partnerships and funding, in which the Union plays a key role. The enlargement of the Union will mean that Russia will soon find itself in a new geo-political situation which will force it to completely renegotiate its status and relations with its new European neighbours. This time, we must condemn this state of lawlessness and send observers and representatives from the foreign media to find out what is really happening in this tragic, barbaric situation, or impose genuine retaliatory measures if attempts to do this are blocked. We must demand that medical and humanitarian assistance be sent, as a matter of extreme urgency and, above all, we must stop using statements to hide our lack of action and stop soothing our conscience by claiming that we are preserving fragile democracy in Russia. We must avoid any simplistic equation between the fight against terrorism and deliberate genocide. As long as we remain indifferent, the barbaric situation in Chechnya can only deteriorate further.

 Mr President, I was half expecting your response as we are well aware that education is the responsibility of the Member States. The reason I asked this question, however, is precisely because it is really urgent. You all know that people everywhere are talking of nothing but sustainable development, without knowing exactly what this term means. We must therefore take action, and I think it would be useful if, at Council and European Union level, an initiative was taken precisely so that we could envisage every pupil, every high school student perhaps, being able to have a lesson on ‘sustainable development and the environment’ within the European Union. Although it is not the responsibility of the Member States, I believe there have been other requests on the history of the European Union. I think this is urgent, as we have been talking about the environment and environmental education for thirty years, and ultimately, this subject is always the responsibility of the Member States or the voluntary sector. I think it is time, and the matter is urgent now, to implement provisions and practical initiatives.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to present to you the report on biodiversity. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Members here today and those who worked with me with a view to drafting and presenting this resolution to you today. I would also like to thank the draftsmen of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Development and Cooperation who supported all the drafts that your rapporteur presented on the protection of biodiversity. Lastly, I would also like to thank the NGOs who really made an enormous effort for this report. We know that they are excellent observers who have a perfect understanding of the status of biodiversity throughout the world. Mr President, the situation is not rosy and I would like to answer a question that, strictly speaking, has not been raised but which is often implicit in some Members’ comments. What is the real use of biodiversity, or, in more straightforward terms, why protect nature when there are so many other issues of concern? I would like to remind you that biodiversity plays a part in our own survival and that although nature does not need man to survive, we, as human beings, need nature in order to live. Our responsibility as elected representatives is to preserve a rich biodiversity. This rich biodiversity holds the assets for the development of future generations. Each living species that disappears from the face of the planet is an irreversible and irretrievable loss, and if we allow biodiversity to be destroyed, we are slowly but surely destroying ourselves. We can see this destruction taking place every day. Is the Brazilian Congress not due to issue an opinion in the near future on a project that authorises the use of 50% of the Amazon rain forest, which we know represents a huge genetic pool? It is not out of disinterest that man destroys or threatens biodiversity – very much the opposite in fact. It is out of genuine interest. It is because huge financial interests are at stake, involving the precious wood as well as trafficking in endangered species, the intensive farming of land, the overexploitation of fish stocks or even the pillaging of the age-old practices of indigenous peoples. In order to put a stop to this massacre, the Convention on Biological Diversity was signed at the Earth Summit in Rio. Ten years down the line, it is still the poor relative – the Convention’s signatory States have not kept their commitments and so far no country has biodiversity in its list of priorities for September’s summit in Johannesburg. In just a few days’ time, the Conference in The Hague will be held, which will bring together those party to the Convention on Biological Diversity, the European Parliament, by means of our resolution, must shoulder its responsibilities and send out a strong and clear message. We call upon the Union to place the issue of biodiversity on the Johannesburg agenda and upon the Commission to present an action plan at this meeting, as it is doing for the European Union. We must reiterate the fundamental role of biodiversity as the cornerstone of sustainable development and the importance of the full application of the Convention and its provisions. We also call on the Union to put in place an ambitious policy to preserve its own biodiversity. The action plans presented by the Commission in the areas of natural resources, agriculture, development and fisheries, which are the subject of this report, may, of course, be seen as a first step along this road, but they are not enough. We need additional action plans, particularly for forestry and for transport, as all these Community policies had or still have a negative impact on biodiversity. And although the Commission claims its ambition is to reverse the current trend, it is fully aware of the challenge that it faces. The report states – and I quote – that “during recent decades, the reduction and loss of biodiversity in Europe and worldwide has accelerated dramatically and existing measures have proved to be insufficient to reverse present trends”. I would add to this the new threats posed by the introduction of certain GMOs and even the conflicts related to the ownership of living things, which give an indication of future ambitions. To reverse this destructive tendency is a bold challenge, admittedly, but it is one we are prepared to face. The European Union has still to equip itself with the political and financial means to hope to achieve this objective. We already have the birds and habitats directives, which enable us to preserve a part of our biodiversity. We demand that they be applied throughout the European Union, including in the candidate countries and in the outermost regions and particularly in areas such as the coral reef. We must find ways of preserving these areas. The second way of making headway in implementing a sustainable ecological development plan, as formally acknowledged at the Gothenburg Summit, is to equip ourselves with effective means of measuring how far the environment is taken into account in the Union’s policies. The Barcelona Spring European Council is due to adopt six environmental indicators. This is not enough. No mention is made of biodiversity. We also call on the Commission to present a specific indicator for biodiversity by 2003. If we want to make progress in the area of biodiversity, we know that we must begin immediately and continue every day to integrate this problem in the policies of the Union, starting with the forthcoming reform of the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy, the policy on transport and the Cotonou development agreements. Although there is consensus between the various groups within Parliament on the ways of protecting biodiversity, several Members hold conflicting views on the impact of GMOs on biodiversity. Nonetheless, as rapporteur, I hope that the references to the environmental liability of GMOs for polluting the countryside are retained. To sum up, allow me, Mr President, to presume that no one would even think of planning to destroy a cathedral, for example, or a listed monument to build a motorway. We must have the same approach towards preserving our natural heritage and biological diversity.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should give a very warm welcome to Mr Gahrton’s report, which offers the three republics of the South Caucasus region the prospect of a way out of a situation marked by regional conflicts and a state of uneasy truce, so that they can finally find the path towards the durable peace that each of the republics and their populations desire. We have the political responsibility to help them in their quest. The reflections and proposals contained in the report also give an indication of the potential of the European Union to wage an active diplomatic campaign and to affirm its status and its role, and these are not fine words or empty rhetoric. Be they friends or rivals, these three republics in the South Caucasus are sister nations. The doors of the Council of Europe have been opened to them, and in that forum of discussion and exchange many of the tensions between them have already been eased. This antechamber of Europe must offer them new prospects of even closer fellowship with the European family, so that the Union can ultimately snuff out their age-old tensions. This highlights our responsibility, for the world and our continent are becoming increasingly interdependent. Besides the familiar question of oil, water is now becoming an equally strategic issue for the entire region, and before, on top of all this, an accident occurs in the Metsamor nuclear power station, it is also our responsibility to help these three countries to pre-empt such a threat.

 Mr President, the very recent and all too familiar disasters that have taken place in the Mont Blanc and Gotthard tunnels reveal the terrible truth about Europe’s current transport policy. And in this case, revealing the truth can only lead to condemnation. The world of road transport seems to have broken free from any legal framework, from any control standards. Freight companies exempt themselves from having operating permits, work permits are becoming optional for drivers who increasingly come from outside the Union, when their driving times verge on the limit and when they themselves verge on sleep. How many more Gotthards and Mont Blancs must go up in flames before they are covered by strict legislation, by an effective system of controls which is both harmonised and trans-European? The residents of all sensitive or high-density areas and all professionals are calling for Europe to intervene and the matter is of the greatest urgency. The most sensible course of action would now be to set up safety escorts for convoys of lorries in every major tunnel. Until this first safety measure is put in place, lives will still be in danger when these two accident-stricken tunnels are reopened. We must no longer be asked to show patience over this harmonisation of safety standards for tunnels. Instead, the finger must be clearly pointed and this political nervousness, this lack of commitment on the part of public authorities to the costly but necessary restructuring of underground tunnels must be condemned. Although a review of practices in the road transport sector is required, an in-depth discussion of our transport policy is no less needed. The tragedies that have taken place in these tunnels demonstrate the physical and ideological shortcomings of the ‘everything by road’ approach, which clogs up transport links and chokes the environment. Let us open up our eyes, then, and cast off the blinkers that force us to see only roads, and we will finally see the entire European network of stations and railway lines that are almost completely overlooked in terms of providing piggyback transport. We will see that some ports, such as those in Italy, offer transit options that are likely to reduce traffic considerably on the road links of European trade. The memory of the victims of Gotthard and Mont Blanc must inspire us to adopt a new approach, one that is more forward looking and more respectful of our means of transport.

Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I too would like to express our solidarity with the people of Honduras, Nicaragua and Cuba, whose countries have been tragically devastated by the effects of hurricane Michelle. Along with Iris, on 8 October, and Mitch, which we have not forgotten, this hurricane is one of a long list of natural disasters which regularly affect areas which are already suffering, adding tragedy to poverty. These disasters, termed natural disasters, are a further reminder that climate change and non-sustainable development exacerbate the already substantial devastation and will continue to do so in the future. Although the European Union is to be congratulated on the aid it is sending to Honduras and Nicaragua, it must be noted that Cuba is totally excluded from this demonstration of solidarity. Cuba, which has suffered its worst disaster in 50 years, is unable to receive our help, for it is the only country in Latin and Central America which does not have a cooperation agreement with the European Union. This situation is no longer appropriate: it is our duty to restate the need for a cooperation agreement focusing on environmentally sustainable development to be signed with Cuba without delay, and to review the European Union’s position. We advocate equal treatment for all countries, and Cuba is certainly not benefiting from the same treatment as other countries. Moreover, the American embargo on relations with the island is preventing it from buying the food and medical supplies so desperately needed by the people of Cuba. The pharmacies are empty and there is a shortage of everything in the hospitals. We cannot tolerate a situation which deprives an entire people of the aid received by neighbouring countries which have suffered the same disasters. In order to change this, we must also support the call for the embargo against Cuba to be lifted.

 Commissioner, Mr President, just as certain small-scale conflicts receive poor media coverage, so certain categories of what are known as light weapons could be said to receive poor legislative and financial coverage. I mean that the legislation regulating them is insufficient and that they are cheap to buy. Why are we surprised, then, when it is this type of arms which keep these forgotten conflicts alive? Yet the number of victims alone 
should concern us, if it were not concealed by the effects of poverty. However, evidence that the world does have a conscience has emerged in the shape of the United Nations Programme of Action aimed at containing and controlling the transfers, or rather the trafficking of these light weapons which are responsible for extensive loss of human life. In the light of the current international situation, with the armed alliance in Afghanistan and the international fight against terrorism, there is even greater need for the Union to join and support this resolute, pioneering UN measure. The European Union’s military policy must be more than just defence measures controlled by senior military staff. It must, in essence, be based on the prevention and control of the arms trade by an arsenal of binding laws covering all areas of this industry. Our legislation must target arms brokering and export and detention licences, as well as extradition and police cooperation procedures, and national legislation governing these issues must be harmonised. Instead of attempting to intervene in blazing conflicts, would it not be better to defuse them before they ignite? The Union’s legislative structure would allow us to do this at the stage when we are still preparing for military action. Europe must seize the opportunity afforded here.

 – Mr President, Commissioner, the St Gotthard disaster, which has caused many victims, incontrovertibly belies the arguments that prevailed in Mr Gayssot’s decision to reopen the Mont-Blanc tunnel. We cannot limit ourselves to lamenting the victims. We must finally take action to definitively stop this flood of disasters and we have good reasons for demanding this in Parliament. From the environmental point of view, reopening the Mont-Blanc tunnel goes against the commitments given by the European Union and its Member States on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. What is the point of our voting in favour of sustainable transport and switching from road to rail if, at the first opportunity to show determination to reverse the ‘everything by road’ trend, this option is removed? In the two years of work on the tunnel, rail freight transport has not increased. It has remained static at 10.5 million tonnes per year, whereas additional rail capacity does exist and the 13.5 million tonnes that transit every year through the Mont-Blanc tunnel could have been absorbed by rail if capacity had been doubled for transit through Mont-Cenis, through the link that runs south of Lake Geneva and through the Dijon-Valorme link. It is incomprehensible that this rail solution should have been ignored, since it represents a transit capacity of up to 20 million tonnes per year via trans-Alpine routes. I should like the Commissioner to take note of this point, because I am giving him very practical proposals. It seems, however, that he is not interested. I would, therefore, like to say to him that we completely disagree with his analysis of the safety of the Mont-Blanc tunnel. This is another reason why we do not accept that it should be reopened. The EUR 200 million’s worth of work that has been undertaken, without an impact assessment or a public inquiry, does not meet the highest safety requirements. The tunnel is still a narrow (seven metres wide) single-direction tube that has no tarmac-covered and, therefore, fire-resistant surface, central escape hatch or parallel evacuation tunnel. The old ventilation duct will be used for evacuation. Safety must be of primary importance for all forms of transport and not only, as you stated, for air transport. The Commission must, therefore, reject the reopening of the Mont-Blanc tunnel and accept the proposals that the Commissioner has ignored, but which are perfectly appropriate alternative proposals, which seek to use the railways for transit through the Alps.

 Madam President, Commissioner, we have reached a serious point, a very serious point. The worst-case scenario of terrorist air attacks on nuclear power stations, long condemned by the Greens and anti-nuclear citizens, is becoming, through force of circumstance, a valid hypothesis. The fact that France has called on its armed forces in an attempt to protect its reactors is evidence that air attacks on nuclear plants are plausible. The French authorities, which have always dismissed the possibility of terrorist attacks, are now forced to admit that their nuclear temples are indeed vulnerable. And will the ground-to-air missiles deployed around the re-processing plant in The Hague be effective against a suicide attack? The German authorities and the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna recognise that even the sturdiest nuclear power station would not survive a crash. Throughout Europe and elsewhere in the world, the danger is certainly present, and it is made all the more acute because of the overwhelming number of nuclear reactors. We cannot currently guarantee the safety of our citizens. They are concerned and quite rightly so. Has the Commission taken these disaster scenarios seriously? How will it ensure the safety of our citizens? And does the Commission intend to launch a study into the safety of nuclear power stations, as Germany has? Lastly, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret the fact that my fellow Members from other groups did not deem it necessary to follow this debate with a resolution.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, how far is the European Union going to let the situation in the countries in the Southern Caucasus deteriorate before it finally decides to fully commit itself to the region, in keeping with local and regional expectations? Europe needs to provide enough funds to support its policies, and that is far from being the case for the Caucasian regions. A few months ago in this House, members of the delegation for relations with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia urged the European Union to become involved and to commit to a firm and determined policy for the region, where geo-strategic interests are at stake that are both significant and varied. We cannot continue to say one thing and mean another. Our commitments need to be followed by specific actions. Implementing a Commission delegation in each of the countries would send out a strong political signal. It would be irresponsible to make these countries, who are struggling to affirm their identity, complete their transition process and establish a real democracy, believe that they can count on the political support of the European Union when the reality is that nothing is actually taking place and secretly it is only the oil and gas in the Caspian sea that are of interest. That would be unacceptable. Although the Swedish presidency took an initial step by visiting the countries concerned, what has actually been achieved? And has the report by Mr Gahrton, not been put back to a later date in the schedule? Moreover, as my fellow Members have said, this is a matter of urgency: does the OSCE not describe the situation as a state of no war? Let us not forget the powder keg of the impassioned claims on Nagorno Karabakh and the desire for independence of some regions of Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Yes, Mr President, yes Commissioner, the European Union has an essential role to play in this region. It should take the initiative of a Europe/Caucasus conference with the various States in order to establish, through a non-violent solution to the conflicts, lasting peace and sustainable development.

 Mr President, the report by our Green colleague, Alex de Roo, will no doubt mark a milestone in the European Union's environmental legislation. Until now, we had an almost total legislative silence about the environmental damage caused by noise. Our parliaments lent a deaf ear, although this in no way reflected the real-life experience of the citizens of the Union. More than a quarter of them, one hundred million, believe they are the victims of noise and the economic repercussions of this noise in the environment oscillates at between EUR 10 and 40 billion. So we can only welcome the pioneering measures set out in this report. We do indeed need to introduce noise mapping. It is as necessary and salutary as the mapping of dangerous sites, which we now realise, all too late, is a vital measure. This information is useful only if it is given to the public quite transparently. It is meaningful only if it is constantly updated in terms of geography and choice of indicators. Lastly, identifying these noise nuisances will only be useful and effective if it is accompanied by penal and coercive measures against the noise-makers, be they civil, public or military. Over and above these practical imperatives, we can really only combat euro-noise today if we do so at European Community level. We therefore continue to call for common European standards. Noise respects no frontiers; noise penetrates every wall, resounds through every space. We therefore urged all our parliamentary colleagues to support this report and we welcome the outcome. Noise pollution reaches us in diffuse, sporadic and intangible ways; often it even forms part of our daily environment. Noise is not as black as oil, or as acrid as chemical waste; yet it is just as harmful, in condensed form. I hope therefore that the demands set out in this report will not be regarded simply as sound and fury but that the European Union will manage to make them resound for a long time.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I understand your arguments in favour of crossing the Alps. However, I should like to tell you that at the present time, as I am sure you are aware, the public debate on the opening of the Mont-Blanc tunnel is in full swing, and the citizens of Europe, French and Italian, are appealing to us precisely in order to plead for a different cause, for a real sustainable transport system, which is not transport by road. Do you really think – and I am asking because you have presented road transport to us as being a sustainable form of transport – do you really think, on the basis of the studies that have been carried out, that the opening of this Mont-Blanc tunnel will be strictly in line, first of all, with requirements, and secondly, with the obligations that we have entered into, in particular with regard to Kyoto?

 Mr President, the Erika
, storms, Toulouse, I hope that we will not have to add Carling to the list, a chemical plant that is 50 km from here as the crow flies and near to my home in Lorraine. How many more deadly signs do we need, Commissioner, before we agree to discuss our society’s future? Our society is adrift, like a wayward ship set to a faulty automatic pilot. Are we still going to accept as inevitable, in the name of employment and the all-powerful economy that communities should continue to live at risk, as they do in Toulouse and elsewhere? Were these communities informed of the risks that they faced? It would appear not. On the other hand, the communities that are aware of the risks, with ecologists at the top of the list, have been calling for drastic measures for years, such as improving factory safety and of course, the closure of the most dangerous ones. Unfortunately, in Toulouse, the worst imaginable scenario occurred. Of course, no chemical factory, no nuclear power plant, particularly following 11 September and the appalling terrorist attack on the United States will be out of bounds, the appalling now having become possible. This must by no means prevent our countries, with the European Union leading the way, from being able to adopt the measures necessary to guarantee the citizens the highest level of safety in their workplace and in their everyday lives. The Seveso I directive represented a huge step forwards. Seveso II is an improvement on this but has yet to prove itself, since it has not yet been fully implemented. The investigation will tell us whether, in Toulouse, its provisions were being implemented, but this looks unlikely. Did those responsible not consider such a disaster to be highly improbable? What Europe needs today is more than just a Seveso III. First of all, however, I hope that we do not give in to populism by giving the impression that with one wave of a wand, we could transfer these high-risk factories to another place, a more distant and safer place. No high-risk factories should be relocated to developing countries, in the same way that it would be a mistake to consider transplanting these factories into the countryside. Secondly, specific industrial sites must be defined, while – let us remember, Commissioner – large amounts of money and European funds have been provided to regenerate industrial wasteland and convert some of it into theme parks. It would have been more appropriate to use these places to build factories with stricter regulations. Thirdly, it is absolutely crucial that the Commission present, as rapidly as possible, its draft directive on environmental responsibility, which is the only solution that will force negligent or even unwilling factory owners to comply with restrictive regulations. Lastly, we need to ask: what kind of society do we want to build? If we carry on as we are, we will be authorising production of chemical molecules whose impact on health or potential risks when transported or manufactured we do not know. This is our social model, which must be completely changed in order to guarantee future generations a life free from terrible accidents and danger.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you may rest assured that, unlike Mr Gollnisch, I will not call for every last detail of maritime safety to be resolved. Although we welcome the speedy attempts to ensure the safety of transport by sea, we also remember that the ‘Erika I’ package has still not been adopted in full. Once the initial excitement is over, the institutions, including Parliament, relapse into their slow procedures, which is a pity. We must keep up the pace for the ‘Erika II’ package, and I hope it will not be plagued by subtle attempts to slip in amendments that may be relevant but have no chance at all of being adopted by the Council, with a view to slowing down the procedures. For the object of this package is to establish an effective arsenal of legal provisions to ensure maritime safety, after all the disasters that have occurred, and to prevent pollution. On the report on the monitoring system, we totally support the rapporteur’s proposals, especially those seeking to make it compulsory as from 2007 to install a black box in all ships entering EU ports and on a system of automatic identification of ships, so that they can be monitored by the coastal authorities. The directive will also require Member States to determine ports of refuge for ships in distress. This provision will, no doubt, pose some problems and we will have to be very careful how we implement it. Turning to the European Maritime Safety Agency, we welcome its establishment but we would have preferred it to serve as the point of departure for a future European coastal agency. That is not the case, but with time and experience, that is what it could turn into. We would like it to be independent, whereas the Commission proposals in fact leave it little margin for manoeuvre. We are sorry that our proposal to include representatives of the NGOs and trade unions on the administrative board were rejected. These voluntary players often make pertinent proposals and could be objective and constructive allies for the agency. With regard to where the agency will be based, before the final choice is made, we would like to see a number of criteria introduced, such as the frequency of accidents at sea, the intensity of maritime traffic and the maritime infrastructure of the candidate countries concerned. Finally, the third report concerns the European Fund, modelled more or less on the IOPC Fund, which was unable, a year and a half after the Erika 
disaster, to compensate the victims, although the appropriate authorities had made the necessary financial promises and set early deadlines. We fully endorse the main objectives, such as the aim of raising the compensation ceiling, given that damages for the Erika 
disaster came to EUR 300 million, whereas the IOPC Fund has a ceiling of no more than EUR 200 million. We think it is crucial to extend the compensation to include environmental damage. In fact, this would be the first time that the financial evaluation of environmental costs was given in figures and that compensation was paid for repairing damage to the environment. The Committee on Transport's attitude in this regard is difficult to understand and tends in the opposite direction. We regret that. Lastly, on contributions to the fund, we believe that those who own and charter the ships should also have to contribute to this fund.

 The three reports on environment and development tabled for voting at the part-session on 31 May 2001 will set the tone of the European Parliament for the preparations for the Gothenburg Summit. Ten years after the concept of sustainable development was recognised as the development system that can reconcile economy and ecology, despite a whole host of standards and regulations, on the whole the environment has suffered more than it has gained as a result of development. Although the concept of sustainable development seems to be understood by the Commission and certain Member States, this is almost certainly not the case in all fifteen Member States. Even some Members of the Commission still imagine that economic development in the long term can be adjusted simply by adding a dash of environment. However, it is all very well for the European Union to talk about wanting sustainable development. The fact is, that its policies on agriculture, the economy, transport, energy, foreign affairs and development persist in demonstrating that the reverse is true. The environmental aspect still ends up playing the Cinderella role. This situation is clearly reflected in the reports tabled before the European Parliament. The resolutions have succeeded in giving practical expression to our responsibilities and obligations in the face of the continuous deterioration of our planet, global warming, and the disappearance of biodiversity, and they serve as a reminder that only a completely new approach to policies can hope to reverse these trends. As far as they go, all these proposals, the abolition of subsidies which have a harmful impact on the environment, the introduction of ecotaxes, environmental responsibility, making WTO reform conditional upon environmental aspects, the annual assessment of policy progress using credible criteria, are moving in the right direction. However, will the Council and the Commission have the courage to take into account the position of the European Parliament? We cannot count on it. Despite the clear thinking behind policies dealing with global warming, and the undertakings that have been given either orally or enshrined in treaties, guidelines or other international agreements, as yet these pious wishes have been put into practice on only a very modest scale. Remember that greenhouse-gas emissions would have to be reduced by 80-90% over a period of 50 years in order to halt the global-warming process. So far, a figure of only 8% has been agreed The Fifteen know what is at stake. Will they have the heart and the courage, at Gothenburg, to change direction and change gear, by daring to get to grips with the issues of CAP reform, transport pollution, and energy? If not, it will be with full knowledge of the facts that they will have to take on board the economic, social, environmental and financial consequences of their political inconsistency.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the outburst of violence which rocked the region of Kabylia was, unfortunately, predictable – or even inevitable. Instead of worrying if this sort of social explosion might happen, we should have been forecasting when it would happen. The region of Kabylia is a microcosm of all the ills which beset Algeria, with its unfortunate colonial parentage, a microcosm of the national cohesion which has never quite made it and is based on democratic and legal institutions and a rule of law which have never been credibly founded. And, centre stage on this Algerian social scene, masses of young people, the life force of the nation, crammed into a few urban centres facing nothing but mass unemployment. What choice did they have other than to rebel and bemoan their fate? Are they supposed to keep quiet as well? And what policy can the Algerian government engage in other than to establish proper rule of law, starting today with committees of inquiry. Is the government supposed to turn a blind eye as well? Surely – and this is vital – it should at long last offer Algerians a real future by introducing economic reform. Otherwise, this fire will continue to smoulder beneath the surface of Algeria.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to join my fellow Members, who have signed this resolution, to express, on behalf of my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, our unwavering solidarity with all the people affected by the flood, and I am aware that even today, whole families are waiting to be relocated to safe new homes. Everything must be done in order to assist these people, who have suffered considerably. We can also support the observation in the resolution, which pinpoints disastrous flooding as the cause of these increasingly common situations and we have to look into the natural character of these happenings. The exceptional levels of rainfall do not explain everything and it is easy to attribute the repeated disasters to thoughtless planning policies which have disregarded and, all too often, still disregard the important role of the natural environment and the instability of high-risk zones, such as those liable to flooding, in alleviating flooding, for example. It is a sign of progress that everyone here today acknowledges this. It is absolutely imperative, however, that future regional planning policies incorporate this new information on environmental considerations and sustainable development, particularly within the framework of the Structural Funds and the common agricultural policy. I therefore appeal today to my fellow Members, who are aware of these dangers, to bear in mind, when they come to vote on the guidelines for the common agricultural policy, the Structural Funds and the ERDF, the consequences of the policies that we are implementing when we provide aid packages.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall present the ideas of my colleague, Hélène Flautre, who has had to leave in order to prepare for her visit to Algeria with our delegation. One year on from Lisbon, the outlook is bleak. The dream of a Europe in which the words ‘new economy’ are synonymous with growth and full employment is fading. The suddenness and the increase in redundancy programmes have made employees think seriously about the delays in building a social Europe. All companies are affected: market leaders who are long established in their fields and which act as windows onto society, such as Ericsson, Danone and Philips; players that have appeared in the wake of the liberalisation of transport, such as AOM and Air Liberté, who are making their employees pay for their failed merger and companies who carry off all the prizes for showing contempt for their employees, such as Marks [amp] Spencer, whose employees are demonstrating today in London. We offer our support to these employees, and to those that are here in the House. According to the Commission, a total of over a quarter of a million redundancies have been announced across the world in the last few weeks. The Commission has just announced its plan to introduce a package to provide effective legal guarantees to workers regarding information and consultation. This is good news at a time when employees who are up in arms are joined by a public which disapproves of unilateral action by employers. We have the responsibility of setting this high-speed train in motion. At the same time, we must quickly adopt the directive on the information and consultation of workers, in order to put an end to the scandalous practices of companies that challenge the social legislation of the Member States. We must revise the 1994 Works Councils Directive, give them real rights to receive advance notice of plans and to receive expert advice, and make them compulsory for all transnational companies of more than 500 employees. We must adopt the directive on worker involvement in the European company and ensure that their representatives participate in supervisory committees and boards of directors where the decisions are taken. Lastly, we need to reform our legislation on mergers and acquisitions, which takes no account of their social and geographical impact. The objective we need to pursue is a European social law that is comprehensible, workable, progressive and on a par with competition law. Our objective is to have a Europe that works on two fronts: economic dynamism and genuine social democracy. The Commission has demonstrated its will to make progress on this issue. All we need to do now is persuade the Council.

 Mr President, by imposing recycling standards on waste electrical and electronic equipment, the European Parliament is boosting efforts to make this industry more ecologically sound. It is essentially the environment that has won through in the battle between the supporters of an innovative industry in electrical and electronic goods and the conventional manufacturers who slammed on the brakes so they could delay the date on which they would be responsible for recycling waste. Although we can congratulate the rapporteur on having chosen to deal with these products, we regret that the Commission has not taken the opportunity to deal with electrical and electronic waste and chemical substances associated with it. With regard to this second report, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance deeply regrets that, out of 70 substances, only two are to be banned, when breast milk is sometimes contaminated with chemical substances from these products, such as brominated products, to levels which exceed WHO standards. Despite this harsh comment, the primary innovation of this report is that it places individual responsibility on the manufacturers, as they will become financially responsible for their products, both products that are already on the market and future products. The environmental considerations contained in the report are gaining ground, and there is growing political awareness of the danger of increasing amounts of industrial waste, particularly electrical and electronic waste. Ultimately, now that this has to happen, everyone will benefit at the end of the day: manufacturers, consumers and the environment. The report by Mr Florenz on waste electrical and electronic equipment has therefore 
benefited from some substantial environmental gestures, 
which confirm that industry in Europe must work with the aim of creating an environmentally-minded culture, for citizens and for politicians.

 Mr President, Commissioner, as you have explained, the issue of Chernobyl is by no means done and dusted. After 14 years, the European Union has a responsibility to take a different course of action, as, in response to this human tragedy, the measures taken still focus largely on the energy technology aspects. The European Commission gave in to blackmail by the Ukrainian authorities by approving the construction of two new nuclear power plants in exchange for closing down Chernobyl. This self-seeking collusion between the political elite and the nuclear lobby rides roughshod over the total disapproval of Ukraine’s citizens and the potential that Ukraine has for renewable energy sources and energy savings. With regard to Belarus, 23% of the territory is affected by radiation and needs to be evacuated immediately. It is essential, therefore, that the second part of the TACIS programme be implemented in Belarus to provide medical and health support, in Belarus and within our own Member States, to the civilian population still living in the contaminated areas and particularly to children. This moral and humanitarian duty must be accomplished with adequate resources and funding which are in line with the extent of the ecological disaster. The autocratic and repressive regime in Belarus, which wants to play down this public health crisis as far as possible and to silence scientists such as Mr Nesterenko and Mr Bandazhevsky, can no longer be used as an alibi by the European Union and pro-nuclear lobbies to hide the reality of Chernobyl and abandon the long-suffering communities of these contaminated regions, to their fate. It is also the responsibility of the WHO, a direct accomplice in this tragedy through an incestuous agreement concluded in 1957 with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which takes, of course, a pro-nuclear stance, and which has since become its legal censor in nuclear matters. It is also the European Union’s responsibility to free the WHO from the control of the IAEA.

Mr President, Commissioner, although it was distressing to hear in The Hague of the failure of the signatories to the agreement on global warming to implement the Kyoto Protocol, we must nevertheless welcome the healthy political reactions condemning the shameful provocation by President Bush who, by trying to blow the commitments of the fight against greenhouse gas emissions out of the water, is simply rewarding the American oil lobby which financed his electoral campaign. Commissioner, we must save the Kyoto Protocol. The survival of the planet is at stake. That is why we must set an example. With or without the United States, the European Union must sign the Kyoto Protocol. We must show and we must prove to the whole world that, as one of the parties responsible for currently polluting the planet, we are genuinely committed, in practical terms too, to combating greenhouse gas emissions. Public opinion supports us in this. We must convince the American public that its President is making an historic mistake.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 26 March, ten humanitarian workers from the United Nations and Médicins sans Frontières were taken hostage by a militia leader in Somalia, which should give the international community some idea of how far into the abyss this country has fallen. When banditry or acts of war – I am not sure how to distinguish between them in this case – afflict missionaries, even those working for peace and charity, which these Westerners are, and when these become bargaining chips for the warmongers, civilian populations are using this type of violent action to make the most desperate appeal for help to the international community. What sort of situation can this anonymous mass of people be in, if even those who are helping them are harmed in this way? What can be the cause of their complaints? Were these people not able to contact us in any way other than by kidnapping 10 UN and MSF workers, who are exemplary in their commitment but subjected to intense media coverage simply because they are from the West? The hostages have now all been released, but this appeal must not be allowed to fade away and we must give the most effective and committed reply in response. In other words, we must take immediate action to ensure that humanitarian workers can work in safety in Somalia, this long-suffering country, and provide a long-term policy of support to democracy and human rights against a background of national reconciliation. Somalia, which is in a desperate situation, must be put at the core of the European ideals of democracy and solidarity.

 Commissioner, I mainly wanted to talk about the last point on patents. Many citizens are concerned about reducing greenhouse gases and they even send us projects that are extremely interesting but which we are not in a position even to understand and analyse from a technical point of view. I wanted to find out if the Commission had opened any sort of ‘one stop shop’ that these people could contact, because if they are not scientists or do not belong to a university, there is no one to act as a sounding board for their ideas.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the European Parliament has, once again, missed an opportunity to do some straight talking about nuclear energy. It has, once again, side-stepped a fundamental debate on the safe transport of dangerous materials, as if nuclear energy were still the domain of experts and the advocates of nuclear energy and that the debate will, by necessity, be passionate and controversial. I attempted to open this debate at the public hearing on 21 January 2000 when I was the first rapporteur. The all-powerful nuclear lobby pulled strings again, however. Although the first report by Mr Maurice was never presented during the previous legislature, the report before us could have been a step forward but that will not happen. The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted a resolution, with the full support of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which reveals nothing of the concern about opinion on the extremely sensitive issues surrounding the transport of radioactive materials, whereas my original report was perfectly in tune with the changing views of European citizens on these issues. This is indeed a dramatic turn of events, which gives us cause to condemn the subtle workings of the agreements between large political groups manipulated by the pro-nuclear lobby. So, despite the work we have done, the draft resolution before us runs counter to the original proposals and, as a Member of Parliament, I cannot agree to it appearing in a resolution; perhaps silence is tantamount to a crime. Although on many points I had managed to achieve a fair number of compromises between Members who had worked on this matter and tabled amendments, all this work was smashed to pieces the day before the vote in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism when the main groups refused to vote in favour of our compromises. The main issues surrounding the transport of radioactive materials, such as transparency, safety and, more importantly, ways of reducing these transports, have been curtailed in the report that was presented to you. The report adopted by the Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is nothing but a paean to the nuclear industry. As proof of the influence that the pro-nuclear lobby had in the drafting of this change, the amendments presented by the conservatives and the socialists are absolutely identical, word-for-word, as are the acknowledgements from the lobby to the Members, who have gone along with the whole thing. They want us to believe that the transport of radioactive materials is not a matter for the nuclear industry and that we, the Group of the Greens, are in the wrong debate. I should like to see an end to this hypocrisy! Although most radioactive waste often takes the form of small packages to be used in laboratories and medicine, this is not the most dangerous material. In fact, the transport of radioactive waste presents the greatest risk due to the levels of radioactivity. To say the opposite would be a manipulation of the truth. Therefore, we are not being in the least bit provocative in raising the issue of the treatment of these radioactive packages, since we are aware that the entire policy on the safe transport of radioactive materials is based on packaging, which would be guaranteed against all eventualities. Yet, we are aware that many radioactive products including the most toxic, such as plutonium, are being transported around Europe. Is it a crime of lèse-majesté
 to want to see an end to these bombs on wheels? In my report, I tried to provide answers to these issues and to raise the critical question about the origin of radioactive materials transportation. At this point, we reach the issue of the nuclear industry and of nuclear waste reprocessing in particular, since reprocessing in plants in The Hague and Sellafield is what actually causes most radioactive waste to be transported. If reprocessing did not take place, radioactive waste would not be transported. That is the simplest solution and it is possible, because we are aware that reprocessing is an economic and ecological anomaly, given what we now know. The most recent development in the transport of highly radioactive materials is that waste from MOX-fuel processing plants is stored, quite illegally, in The Hague. This means, Mr President, that it has been illegally transported as well. There is no point in seeking to curtail the debate, as the report is trying to do. We might improve it, on the other hand, by voting in favour of the amendments that I have just presented.

 Mr President, democracy alone will deliver states from barbarism, ethnic warfare and despotic and military governments. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is no exception to this rule. Despite the 1999 Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement, which provided for a UN-supervised ceasefire, the disarmament of all the armed factions, the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the establishment of internal dialogue between the government and the opposition, both armed and civilian, the state of war has nonetheless continued and is paralysing both the economic and political situation throughout the whole region. The European Parliament must condemn in the strongest terms all these acts of violence perpetrated against the civilian population and must also condemn the military intervention by neighbouring countries and demand the withdrawal of all foreign troops. Following the assassination of President Laurent Kabila, the international community and the European Parliament must intervene in this political transition. We must ask the new Head of State to lift the ban affecting political parties. Mr Joseph Kabila must demand and must clearly announce a timetable for the opening of internal Congolese dialogue and the organisation of free elections. The civilian population, whose economy and welfare has already been hit hard – particularly in the suburbs of Kinshasa, must not once again fall victim to the lack of political interest on the part of our continent, nor of the perfectly casual attitude of investors and firms operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, more especially in terms of human rights, the environment and the rule of law. We have political responsibility in Africa and we must take action to safeguard the dignity of the peoples of Africa.

 Mr President, Commissioner, at yesterday’s meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, we did indeed hear Mr Haavisto who prepared his report on the results of the group of experts. On the other hand, although he spoke about depleted uranium, he made absolutely no mention of the statement made by NATO on 18 January, in which it was admitted that, in addition to depleted uranium, plutonium had also been used. Are you planning to undertake plutonium tests in the region and do you intend to make European Union funds available in order to carry out decontamination work?

 Mr President, Commissioner, the matter before us today is to determine whether or not tomorrow’s vote will result in the lifting of the moratorium on authorisations for the cultivation and placing on the market of GMOs. The answer is, quite clearly, no, it will not. We must pursue the moratorium since the revised 90/220 Directive does not meet all the requirements that we stipulated at the beginning. While there has been some improvement, amongst other things, in the biological monitoring of future affected areas, inasmuch as it is possible to actually identify such areas, this will, however, be at the discretion of the relevant authorities. The final compromise does not respond to consumer concerns, since consumers would like to see guarantees of food safety and to see proper assessment of the risks of releasing GMOs into the environment being carried out. The BSE crisis could have been avoided, had more courageous decisions been taken as soon as the first warning signs emerged. We must not make the same mistake twice. I hope that the Commission will shortly outline proposals to guarantee the complete traceability of GMOs and to establish a reliable labelling system for all GMO-derived products. Only then will we be able to authorise the release of GMOs into the environment.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the era of the railway in Europe is underway, and not before time. It certainly is high time that we developed Europe’s railways properly and, more importantly, allocated resources to this task. At last, we can be confident, we can meet the expectations of all citizens and believe that the shift from road to rail is underway. The conciliation on what is called the ‘railway package’ will have allowed us to lay the foundation stone. At the moment, we have to provide substantial investment for railways to meet our expectations and be recognised as the means of transport that produces the least pollution and helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I shall continue to remind you of the worrying predictions made by scientists regarding the climate change that is, to a great extent, caused by road transport. Glaciers are being melted at a faster rate than steel rails are hardening in the mould. Although we welcome the decision made at the France-Italy Summit to build a new railway between Lyons and Turin, the European Union should be far bolder in its infrastructure plans. In some cases, the question still arises as to whether it is better to build a new motorway rather than considering rail. I am thinking specifically about the Moselle valley freight tunnel, the so-called ‘A32’ project. The European Union must lead the way to ensure that rail becomes the preferred means of transport for all citizens as well as the natural and even the only means of transporting goods.

 Mr President, Commissioner, he who sows the wind shall inevitably reap the whirlwind. These words take on their full meaning when applied to the countries of the southern Caucasus. What region of our own continent, or the next, is more crossed by tensions and issues? What region has a greater need for pacification and normalisation? The southern Caucasus is effectively caught in the pincer grip of regional powers – Russia and Turkey, of conflicts of interest, and hence related military conflicts, from the Nagorno Karabakh plateau to the mountains of Chechnya, or the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The region is stagnating, ossified in political, economic and energy transition processes which continue to exist only in theory. A situation which has until now been held in a vegetative status quo, which may be considered nonetheless as the lesser evil. At least, everything was done to defuse the different justifications for war in the framework of an ad hoc stability agreement. At least the recent incorporation of these three countries, as small geographically as they are strategic regionally, into the Council of Europe could be interpreted as a sign of interest from the nations of Europe, bringing hope of normalisation for the region and a guarantee of a more favourable future for these peoples.  How, then, is the recent unilateral decision by the Russian Government to impose a visa regime for the citizens of Georgia to be interpreted except as deliberate ostracism severing economic trade and historic links between the formerly fraternal Soviet states. How is this administrative segregation between the citizens of the same country, which is recognised by the international community, the people of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Tbilisi, to be interpreted except as official external ratification overriding the integrity of a sovereign state?  Indeed, is a government bill tabled in the Duma to provide for the possibility of annexing a foreign state, or part thereof, even if there are no borders? These are just so many deliberate, calculated sallies in Russia’s muddled geopolitical game, and just as many reasons for us to use our votes to express our condemnation of Russia’s machinations involving its former vassal state and to take practical action to assist the political stabilisation of this region and its economic take-off, and, of course, to appoint, as the resolution proposes, a Special Envoy for the Caucasus: since a gust of wind in the southern Caucasus may indeed blow Europe away.

 Although the directives on conservation of natural habitats, the elimination of PCBs and PCTs, and the protection of waters from nitrate pollution are only inadequately applied in the Member States, this does not mean by any means that these are poor directives which must be changed, as some people in this House would seek to have us believe. These directives fully live up to the ambitions of the citizens of Europe, who are demanding that greater attention be paid to environmental matters and are seeking arbitration from the European authorities. The great numbers of complaints and petitions received by the Committee on Petitions regarding environmental infractions and violations of these directives testify to these expectations. The fact is, if the directives are only partially implemented, it is because the Member States had not weighed the consequences when adopting them. They had not taken on board the implications of the financial costs or the amendments, which could be fundamental, that these directives would require in their policies. This is true both of the Habitats Directive and the Nitrates Directive since they both require the review of agricultural and regional planning policies which may cause pollution or destruction of natural environments. The implementation of the Habitats Directive is intended to provide long-term protection for a European network of biologically outstanding natural habitats and to exempt them from future redevelopment in order to prevent conflicts in land use or damage to those environments. These objectives have, admittedly, been very badly presented in the Member States, causing occasionally very bitter conflicts between the owners and users of these areas. Yet there was no shortage of positive results in those instances where proper coordination was achieved, since the Habitats Directive does indeed make it possible to support heritage-friendly management methods by making adequate compensation available. This Habitats Directive is truly innovative in terms of regional planning and nature conservation in that it reconciles the management and the use of outstanding natural sites in order to make the best use of land. To this end, the European Union must make every effort to support the implementation of this directive. The European Union absolutely must not yield to the industrial interests which would negate the very spirit of the directive. The Commission, as Guardian of the Treaties, must firstly adopt a firm stance with regard to the Member States in order to ensure that they implement these directives and, secondly, to stand firm against attempts to amend these directives even before they have been able to demonstrate their full relevance, particularly in the areas of dealing with nitrate pollution in water and protecting and raising the profile of outstanding natural sites. For the above reasons, the Group of the Greens supports all the reports presented, particularly the Sjöstedt report, which will contribute to improving the implementation of the Habitats Directive. The reason why we abstained, then, is that we do not feel that the last-minute attempts to change the nature of the report, seeking to weaken the Habitats Directive and to urge that it be amended, are in line with respecting the directives on which we are voting.

 Commissioner, the reason I ask this question is simply because my fellow Members in the European Parliament have been working for 15 years for renewable energy to be taken into account. The Commission is beginning to incorporate it, but renewable energy is apparently continuing to be viewed as a back-up supply rather than as the energy of the future. The facts are clear, and the view is expressed that funding is not sufficient, especially compared with levels of investment made in the past for other forms of energy. On the other hand, nuclear energy and nuclear-based electricity, which does not produce any greenhouse gas, were widely promoted as part of the fight against the greenhouse effect, and it was basically asserted that nuclear energy could be seen as an alternative to combat the greenhouse effect. Therefore, this is why we asked the question, to see if the Commission is still on the same wavelength, in wishing to continue to develop renewable energy in both the European Union, and elsewhere in the world, and not just as a backup energy source.

 Madam President, Commissioner, what we have learned from the debate or, rather, the controversy created by Commissioner Bolkenstein in his quest to liberalise the postal services, undertaken in the absence of any assessment of the first phase and in contravention of the rules defined by this directive is that, under cover of progressive and status-enhancing terms such as modernisation, liberalisation and keeping pace with rapid technological developments, we are slipping into a situation in which the social quality of countries is declining. What is being destroyed is the very spirit of local public service, universally appreciated and respected. Let us therefore regard this important phase of examining this directive as a manifestation of the agreement and the bond between Parliament and the citizens of Europe. We have been able to find a majority of MEPs to respond to the questions and challenges it raises, as well as the fundamental risks it poses for the images of our various countries, the identity of our public services and the cohesion of our societies. In this connection, I would thank the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, as well as Mr Simpson for the result that has been achieved. I am all the more grateful due to the fact that my own group has distinguished itself in this counter-offensive. We had joined together in firmly denouncing these liberal excesses and their harmful effects on the territorial, economic and human fabric of our Member States. As a Frenchwoman, I am only glad that I have no part in the dismantling of that reassuring and life-affirming network of 17 000 post offices and sub-post offices, knitted together over 550 000 km2 of our territory and embodying public service for our citizens, in both suburban and rural areas. This debate on postal services is also a warning to the Commission. It will have taught them that impartial and objective studies prior to the issuing of directives ought to be the rule and that, because economic liberalisation does not in any way constitute progress if it is synonymous with social dehumanisation, the notion of general public service ought to be preserved. Account ought also to be taken of indicators to the contrary, such as the liberalisation of postal services in Sweden, and of subsidiary aspects such as the quality of post office jobs and the symbolic value of the post office. In the light of this, I entirely support the compromise proposed by Mr Ferber and Mr Simpson.

Mr President, 
I should like in turn to thank Mrs de Palacio for her comments. We obviously have confidence in her ability to ensure maritime safety because she must know that not a week passes without our being asked what, as Members of the European Parliament, we are doing to ensure safety and to change the rules. I have two questions. Regarding the Erika I package, have you received any replies from the Member States about how precisely they wish to invest and to increase the number of their inspectors, because there is no doubt that, if they do not increase their number, everything that has been decided here will serve little purpose. Regarding the Erika II package, I shall confine myself to one question in the form of an observation, although there are so many to be made! I am very happy to hear you speak of a European coastguard service. Is this really an idea which has had its day, because there are an enormous number of people who support it? Might the setting up of the European Maritime Agency be regarded as the beginnings or basis of a European coastguard service?

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, on 18 January 2000 I brought you a cake of crude oil from the Erika
 which had come ashore on a beach. This oil cake symbolises the enormous amount of work we have to do to make our seas cleaner and maritime transport safer. The Erika
 and the Ievoli Sun
 are but the most recent names to date in the wrecking of an entire system. Firstly, the ecological system is being wrecked, with the natural marine heritage, flora and fauna destroyed or contaminated forever. Then there is social wrecking, with gangs of third-world seafarers, modern-day galley slaves, exploited literally to the point of slavery. Finally, we have economic wrecking, the result of untrammelled liberalism in maritime matters. The liberal tide of free trade which has been unleashed has swallowed up all safeguards, all preventative action and, ultimately, all morals, only to become engulfed itself in its own excesses, thereby revealing the lack of any Community maritime policy worthy of the name. Who today answers for the integrity and healthy conditions of maritime transport? What authorities claim to control and stamp out trade on the high seas, which is more maritime trafficking than maritime traffic? Nobody. What more proof do we need than these coffin ships fit only for the scrap yard, these thirty-year old single-hull tubs that take to the seas in stormy weather? Eight thousand of the ninety thousand ships plying the seas around the world are sub-standard in terms of safety, and four thousand are carrying hazardous substances. In the accident barometer measured against the gauge of shipwrecks the traditional mercury has been replaced by oil or residual acid. Faced with the disastrous and anarchic situation in maritime transport, Europe has taken up the challenge and, just 11 months after the loss of the Erika
, will be in a position to announce that never has a procedure been worked out quite as quickly. This powerful political signal is in our hands. It is up to us to adopt the ‘Erika I’ package and it is up to the Council to accept its final amendments. In responding favourably to this acceleration of the timetable, our group has not, however, given up on the fundamental demands for the enhanced safety of the marine environment. The revisions of the directives concerning port and ship inspections should get rid of the lame ducks as far as the classification societies are concerned and appreciably increase the number of inspectors in the Member States, provided, however, that the latter provide adequate resources to achieve this. But we are also waiting impatiently for the second package, ‘Erika II’, with the establishment of a maritime agency and outline plans for a European coastguard. We may regret the delay in the timetable for the mandatory double hull for oil tankers and the Council’s abandoning of the proposed financial incentive system setting up differential charging of port and pilotage dues applicable to oil tankers, depending on whether they have a single or a double hull. Nevertheless, we support this report which, with its revision clause, provides for the so-called American timetable to be given a second chance in the event of failure at the Marpol Convention in April 2001. We are told that zero risk does not exist, but it has to be said that zero responsibility must not exist either. With the ‘Erika I’ package we will be placing the first foundation stone of a substantive European maritime safety policy, in anticipation, of course, of the ‘Erika II’ package.

 The extreme confusion that has characterised the electoral process over recent weeks in Côte d'Ivoire, which had looked like a model economy until now, is symptomatic of a country in crisis, reflected by an economy in crisis, social despair and, consequently, political chaos. The real issues and national debates were overshadowed by the spurious yet contentious debate about Ivoirian nationality. Côte d'Ivoire was driven into this widespread catastrophe because it was caught in the stranglehold of its financial commitment to lend credibility to its economic prospects and the cruel and indiscriminate fallout from international trade negotiations. That really is the antithesis of the model of true sustainable development, the policy for the future that we Greens advocate. The West bears a patent and overwhelming responsibility for the current collapse of the Ivoirian system. By introducing oils and fats other than cocoa butter into the ingredients of chocolate, the European Parliament has brought about the ruin of this top international cocoa producer's entire national industry. It knocked its social and political system off balance and has even led to the mass graves of Ivoirian civilians, the ultimate but also the direct victims of this chain of decisions and consequences starting in Brussels and ending in Ypougon. The Greens firmly condemn all the acts of violence committed following the elections and lament the victims. Real democracy cannot now be established in Côte d'Ivoire unless an independent commission of inquiry is set up to look into the crimes committed and unless an official undertaking is given on respect for human rights and civil peace. Similarly, this democratic process can only become more credible if a national reconciliation committee is created, together with a national electoral committee to prepare and guarantee future elections, especially the elections of 10 December. It is vital to have foreign observers at these elections to make sure they are conducted legally.

Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am happy to hear within this Chamber that the CAP must be changed at all costs. I would just like to remind certain people that the Greens were indeed alone when, at the top of their voices, they called for the reform of the CAP. With regard to BSE, I welcome the French decision, but the Presidency must not forget that it too must assume its responsibilities as far as food safety at the European level is concerned. I would like to make two points in this connection. I regret that neither the Council nor the Commission has stressed the absolute and immediate need to bring grass and oil seed subsidies in line with those for cereals in order to avoid genetically modified soya being used to make up for the lack of proteins next year. I also believe that criminal and fraudulent acts should not continue to go unpunished. It is outrageous that, after three BSE crises in the space of a decade, no guilty party has been identified or brought to book. This impunity cannot go on. That is why I am calling on the European Union to carry out the necessary investigations among manufacturers of MBMs and knackers in order to find those responsible for these health, economic and social disasters.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as a member of the delegation to the parliamentary cooperation committees for relations with the three countries of the southern Caucasus – Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia – I wholeheartedly support Mr Morillon’s report, particularly Article 18, which calls on the Turkish Government to improve its relations with its neighbours in the Caucasus. While there is a special relationship between Azerbaijan and Turkey, this is far from being the case for Armenia, a country against which Turkey is maintaining a commercial blockade, which is not acceptable in a country which has been accepted as a candidate for membership of the European Union. The dispute relating to acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide should also be waived in order to enable diplomatic and trade relations to be normalised, especially as Turkey plays a key role in the project for the construction of an oil pipeline taking petroleum from the Caspian Sea to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean. Turkey also needs to take on board environmental considerations, particularly in schemes such as the construction of major dams, which will necessarily have an impact on the water systems of neighbouring countries.

 Mr President, Mrs Sudre’s report is indeed of great importance, and even capital importance for the outermost regions, but my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, abstained and I should like to explain why. The problems raised by the report have been identified; there is no further need to go into the details. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is disappointed, however, disappointed that the report did not seize the opportunity to bring about environmentally, socially and culturally sustainable development in these regions and that the amendments adopted during the vote are not such as to improve the text in that respect. We regret that the positions Parliament has adopted in the vote are the European Union’s positions concerning these regions. In particular, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance regrets the report’s rather defensive attitude to the ACP and candidate countries. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is also opposed to granting permanent derogations. We are in favour of applying the principle of derogation to the common policies applied in the outermost regions on a case-by-case basis. I am thinking here of state aid and fiscal policies. We regret the fact that the call to moderate the ‘polluter pays’ principle was endorsed, for that could open the door to misuse in the application of this specific prerogative. We also regret the lack of any reference to, or even mention of, the need to protect biodiversity, which is one of the most important assets of the outermost regions. These regions could act as a wonderful laboratory in terms of sustainable development. That is another missed opportunity. On the other hand, we welcome the paragraphs in the report on promoting renewable energies and monitoring industrial activities which cause pollution.

 Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has indeed voted for Mr Bowis’ report and, while we welcome the fact that the European Parliament and the Commission, with its White Paper, are offering European consumers interesting prospects, food safety must remain an absolute priority in our policies. Let us not be too ambitious, however. The more progress that is made in scientific research, the more new questions are raised. We need only look at developments involving BSE. New cases are being identified week after week and in new geographical areas that had been spared in the past. This applies in particular to the Vosges department in the Lorraine region. With all the measures proposed in the White Paper, we will still have to flesh out a number of points in order to guarantee food safety and in particular restore consumer confidence. The most important points include the creation of the European Food Safety Agency, which we welcome and of which we expect a great deal. It is vital to its credibility that it is independent. This authority must be totally dissociated from the interests of private companies or the Member States. That independence also implies financial independence. The Union will have to free up funds to run it, but will the EFSA be enough to reassure consumers who are worried about what they find on their plates and will soon find in their drinks? The authority will have to be set up by 2002/2003 and we very much hope that the question of where it will have its headquarters will not be an obstacle to its establishment. Meanwhile, the Union must continue to assess and manage food safety risks. That means it must be vigilant day in day out. It means guaranteeing that the policy-makers and the policies that have been put in place really do deal with what people want. The use of animal meal, which is triggering a new food crisis, is unacceptable. Henceforth we must ban all animal meal. That is the strong stance our citizens expect, rather than the kind of tolerance that can end up seriously damaging consumer health. This kind of recognised scientific risk must not be tolerated in any way. Mr Bowis’ report takes that line. That is why the Green Group fully supported his work and voted for the report.

Mr President, the climate changes caused by our consumer habits have begun. My colleagues have referred to the catastrophes that are occurring in quick succession and which serve as warning lights that demand practical political intervention. We welcome the objective and clear-sighted findings of the report by Mr Moreira da Silva regarding the crucial issues and hopes, but also concerning the disillusionment and the renunciations that have infiltrated the battle line in the fight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We know that the most important stage will take place at The Hague in November. We will see whether or not the parties who committed themselves at Kyoto will exercise their responsibilities and meet the demands of the global issues that await us, which put us all in the same boat and spare no one. Many people forecast a fiasco, however, and even an agreement on the cheap, which will sound the death knell of the Kyoto Protocol. We refuse to believe this hypothesis. The European Union delegation must stand firm. It should continue to be the leader, as it was in Kyoto, it should set an example, and it should not give way under any circumstances to the temptations of get-out clauses. Our mandate is clear and our demands are forceful. Ratifying the Kyoto Protocol is crucial, as is the implementation of domestic measures that will make a real contribution to the fight against greenhouse gas emissions. Let us hope that the European Council does not fall into the traps that have been set for it. The European Union must refuse to integrate nuclear power, even if there is strong pressure in favour of mechanisms for clean development. Nuclear power is neither a sustainable energy nor a clean one. It would be just as unacceptable to admit carbon sinks among the flexibility measures. It would be particularly improper and fallacious to make citizens believe that it is enough simply to plant trees to comply with the commitments undertaken at Kyoto. With 80% of its electricity coming from nuclear power and with an extensive covering of forest, France, for example, has not achieved the undertakings it agreed to at Kyoto, which are nonetheless minimal at 0%. Action must be taken in other areas. The European Union does not have the right to shirk its commitments.

 I am particularly disappointed at the European Parliament’s vote on the report on the reproduction of vine plants. I am disappointed that Parliament has neither understood nor tried to understand the message of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and of the Greens, who have tried to draw attention to the underhand way in which the executive committee acted in order to water down the issue of GMOs in its reports so that we will end up with vast amounts of them on our plates and in our glasses. No, I have not got the wrong debate. The Greens are perfectly in tune with public opinion and consumers, who are concerned about future food products. The Greens are in tune with wine growers, producers and merchants who are worried about the introduction of GMOs into vine plants. By refusing, by 397 votes to 115, to back the amendments proposing to withdraw the references to GMOs, the European Parliament has failed in its role of guardian of the precautionary principle and is guilty of allowing GMOs to be infiltrated into vine plant reproduction through the back door, in contempt of European regulations.

 In the press recently we have been able to read that a number of European Union documents mentioned an ‘accidental share of 0.3% of animal meal’, whether this was acceptable or not. I should like to know, specifically, since this question has arisen, if this accidental 0.3% share is becoming an authorised 0.3% share for animal meal. If this were so, it would truly be an underhand way of subverting the precautionary principle which we are attempting to implement here.

 Thank you for your answer, Mr President, but the question went rather further. We monitor, and we are familiar with, the work done by the Commission and the Council on the Erika 1 package, but regarding this strait, which is notorious in the two countries concerned and within the European Union as a particularly tricky passage, one often used by large vessels in order to gain just a few hours at the risk of some old tub’s running aground and causing a disaster, I should like to know, and more especially the inhabitants of Corsica and Sardinia would like to know, if it will be at all possible, and if you have any such plans, to issue a ban, pure and simple, on large vessels, containers, using the Strait of Bonifacio.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reason we wished to defer this report was that we wanted to ensure consistency in the work of the European Parliament as it influenced the course of European policy. The revision of GMO Directive No 90/220 is at the conciliation stage right now. It would be completely inconsistent not to wait until the end of this procedure before including references to GMOs in our directives and regulations. That is why, at the proposal of the draftsman of the opinion, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has unanimously voted to do away with all the references to GMOs in this report. And please do not tell us that we are barking up the wrong tree, and that this revision does not have any implications concerning GMOs, since a regulation of this type already exists for forestry. At the moment, we consume wine, but we do not yet feed on the wood of our forests. Contrary to what the executive committee and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would have us believe, this revision slyly but irremediably introduces genetically modified vines. This is a clear indication that the European Parliament would, indirectly, give the green light to GMO experiments in the field of vine propagation or improvement. Why the rush? It is not at the request of the winegrowers or wine merchants or vineyard owners. On 5 July, some of these issued the Beaune declaration, expressing their great concern at the introduction of GMOs into their sector. We have received a reply from the confederation of producers of registered designation of origin (AOC) wine, saying, “We support the position of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, as it offers the guarantee that European regulations are not going to permit the implementation of procedures to authorise the sale of genetically modified wine-growing materials which may be harmful to the brand image of wine growing.” Just who is going to benefit from this amended regulation which includes GMOs? The question – and the answer, of course – will have to come from the Commission, who must also tell us whether it is intending to continue to pave the way for us to end up with GMOs on our plates, and now in our glasses too. This is something that they are achieving, unfortunately, with the assistance of the French Presidency, in a way that is completely out of step with the way European consumers feel.

 Mr President, what remains to be said on the subject of food safety and the precautions to be taken in order to avoid further instances of contamination or further food crises? Mrs Paulsen’s report grasps the extremely serious nature of the situation but does not go far enough in view of the stakes involved. The outrages – one no longer dares to speak of mere infringements or minor abuses – in the industrial agro-food processing chain in the context of liberalism, competition and the frenzied thirst for profits, have actually proved lethal, even criminal, it must be said. Deliberate violations of health, criminal and even moral codes by doctoring the laws of nature and tampering with animal species and animal physiology are conducted without being subject to any surveillance or appropriate regulations or any justified penalties. Yet we consumers are the last stage in the food chain, and hence the final recipients of the abuses and counterfeits in the food industry. Should we be surprised, then, to find ourselves the victims of these, and even, unfortunately, to yield to them? It is irresponsible and fraudulent to disregard the infinite complexity of the workings and relationships within the industrial agro-food chain in order to admit that it is no longer possible to monitor and separate out exactly what is going on in order to apply appropriate penalties. Every link in the chain must be responsible for what it produces and for its precisely identifiable role. The safety bolt guaranteeing this discipline lies in the Commission’s determination to ensure that consumers are provided with consistent quality, at all levels, in the products available on the market. So, in refusing to accept the inclusion of genetically modified foodstuffs as undesirable products, the European Parliament has taken the responsibility of being completely out of step with the public and the people that elected its Members, as consumers are proving to be more and more reluctant on the matter of GMOs, going so far as to reject them outright when they do have the opportunity to identify them in food. Nor should we be surprised if the agro-food industry leaps headlong into this breach and banks totally on animal feedingstuffs to consume their GMOs. The ball is now in the Commission’s court. It must make good its omissions by proposing and implementing urgent measures in response to the perfectly justified concerns of consumers.

 While I wholeheartedly support Mr Wijkman’s report, particularly the budget allocation obtained through conciliation, I am concerned to see, firstly, that the significance of sustainable development has not been understood, and also that the environment need not necessarily be taken into account in all development projects for underprivileged countries. For how is it possible to plan development time limits or strategies without seeing them in the context of environmental protection? How can we even dissociate development from the environment? Moreover, the conditions valid for the development strategies of Third World countries should also apply to the growth strategies of developed countries. The advocates of untrammelled liberalism will surely not fail to see these environmental safeguards as further restrictions upon, or obstacles to, the difficult economic emergence of these underprivileged countries. What, though, would be the point of an economic take-off which would destroy the environment of a country, sacrificing its ecological potential? The cure would be worse than the disease. The deceptive salve of a purely economic recovery would soon wear off, overtaken by the gangrene of spasms in the environmental arena, and thus the health arena, and ultimately, the social arena. After sacrificing their ecological potential in attempts to achieve an economic take-off, once the first flush of the positive benefits had faded, such countries would find themselves even poorer than before, with even more limited development prospects. The contradiction in terms, however, is patently obvious. Every day we can see examples illustrating the lesson that purely economic development could not possibly be sustainable. It would be a flash in the pan, destined to burn itself out. The very concept of development implies an extended period of time, the long term, and this concept of time implies the concept of the natural environment, the preservation of the human environment. If, today, it is respected by this kind of civilisation and way of thinking, then, tomorrow, it will safeguard that of future generations.

 The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on whose behalf I am speaking, completely supports the report by Mr Fernández Martín on the conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests and other forests in developing countries. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is pleased to see the increase in the budget allocated to protecting tropical forests. In view of the alarming, relentless way they are being devastated, this sudden interest on the part of the European Union looks like a good start, but it is still quite a modest one considering the actual restoration requirements. Until now, indeed, the only attention paid to tropical forests has been a mere selfish reflex on the part of Westerners anxious to safeguard the forests that are the lungs of our planet, in a last ditch attempt of our industrialised societies to bind the wounds, without considering the indigenous peoples living in and off these forest areas, who are condemned to be sacrificed to the profits of the industrial groups exploiting their resources. We have the appalling example of the gold mines in French Guiana, which are laying waste to vast swathes of forest, causing the death of the flora, fauna and the indigenous peoples, which are all suffering from the mercury contaminating their soil, their sap or their bloodstream. This is a phenomenon that is continuing on a daily basis. The argument of concentrating entirely on economics as a last, desperate springboard for the development of Third World countries, which are unable to afford the luxury of environmental safeguards, is mere pettifoggery. There is no sustainable development except in the context of the responsible use of the environment. Similarly, we must point out the fallacy of the assertion of commercial interests that their forestry clearance activities contribute to combating the greenhouse effect. While claiming the same noble motive of environmental conservation, all that such theories are seeking to safeguard are the interests of a few major industrial groups. In the Hague, the European Union must refuse to be drawn into this trap, which would make it possible for tropical forests to be treated like coal mines and shamelessly exploited and for States to be released from their obligations in terms of combating the greenhouse effect.

 Mr President, eight years after the Rio conference, where the countries of the United Nations acknowledged that development and the environment were inextricably linked, the European Union is finally adopting regulations to ensure that the environment is integrated into the development projects of developing countries. Although we have cause to congratulate ourselves on the financial contribution agreed in the course of the conciliation – and I should like to thank the rapporteur on behalf of my group – the budget in question is still modest, given the considerable needs and still greater expectations of the populations concerned. Are we not merely salving our consciences by granting just a little more than EUR 15 million over a period of six years to developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and South America when we are aware of the social, economic and ecological conditions in these underprivileged lands? This budget line, designed to promote the full integration of the environmental dimension in the development process, will be of no significance whatsoever if the environmental dimension is neglected in the case of other projects. I would like to remind you that sustainable development which integrates the environmental dimension fully is still, more than ever, the only model of development able to meet the requirements both of the underprivileged countries of the South and the polluted countries of the North.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the course of this legislature a number of reports about Galileo have been made to the European Parliament in turn by Mrs Langenhagen, who is here today, Mr Glante, Mr Dhaene and myself. They were always presented positively, but nevertheless had to overcome many obstacles to get our European project adopted. It was criticised as duplicating the American GPS, but that made me think of the fable of the blind man and the paralytic. Were we expected to call on the United States to be our eyes and show us the way to go? The cost was said to be ruinous, although it is about the same as building a little more than 100 km of high-speed railway line. Our wisdom finally carried the day and, concerned to implement the European Union’s strategy for employment, economic reform, research, and social cohesion decided by the Lisbon European Council in March 2002, we adopted Galileo. I have now been working for nearly a year on this report to bring us up to date on this project and on the integration of EGNOS into Galileo. However, the fear of a delay in implementation was such that we have been overtaken, and happily so, by the project being put in place and I am now in a position to present the excellent results that we achieved in 2003 and to make a number of recommendations for operational implementation in order to ensure that Galileo really does go into service by 2008 at the latest. I am therefore taking account here of two Commission communications. The first is concerned with the state of progress following the Council decision of 26 March 2002, which saw the informal adoption of the regulation creating the joint undertaking on 21 May 2002, and the second the integration of EGNOS into Galileo. The communication covers the following aspects: the creation of joint undertakings, which has now been done, the system’s security – on our recommendation the supervisory authority was created at the same time as the security centre; its role is vital because it ensures that Galileo will remain a project geared to its users’ wishes; I believe Parliament should be more closely involved with this committee in a way that remains to be decided – service definition and frequency planning, the reservation of frequencies. The problem of the overlay of signals on the fifth service (or PRS) with the US army’s M signal has also been settled. The Commission and the United States have found a compromise. The Galileo signal will surround the US signal and will no longer be overlaid. Relations with third countries have been normalised. There are no problems with the Russian Glonass system. There is some cohabitation, or at least consultation, for the American GPS. And countries are joining us, like China, with whom a promising agreement, especially in the field of research, was initialled in Beijing on 18 September 2003. By way of reminder, Galileo is merely a giant clock consisting of around 30 satellites capable of determining a position in time and space very accurately. Unlike GPS and Glonass, it must remain a purely civilian project. The services it will provide are very important, especially in the environmental field. As a tool for protecting nature, it will help to track pollution by dangerous substances, track icebergs, and map the oceans and sea levels. It will help to monitor the atmosphere, the ionosphere, radio communications, space science and even to predict earthquakes or monitor endangered species. It will be possible to pinpoint dangerous substances such as nuclear waste at any time. We have not forgotten space pollution either, since we shall have to ensure that any new object launched into space can be neutralised. There will be many other developments in transport and communications. I would like to stress Galileo’s fundamental contribution as a spearhead for our European space policy, integrating more closely the roles of the Union and the ESA. And in the European Research Area, a large amount of funding is provided in the sixth research and development framework programme by the European Space Agency’s ARTES programme and the private partners. With a large part of the funding coming from the public purse, the results of the research and the intellectual property will belong to all the European Union’s citizens. So far as EGNOS is concerned, I propose that it be integrated into Galileo, through the good offices of the joint undertaking, because this satellite radio navigation system can only be based on our global system. Galileo is a very important achievement of our legislature. It was proposed and supported by the Council and the Commission, and I want to pay tribute to Mrs de Palacio in transport and energy, to the Director-General Mr Lamoureux and also to Mr Busquin for their energy and determination in bringing it about. I also want to thank all my fellow Members for the constant interest they have shown in Galileo, especially those on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. Galileo is a fine European Union project. First and foremost, it will help to implement our policy of sustainable development with the ethics essential to an action of such breadth. Our Parliament can be proud to have been a driving force in the dynamic that our Assembly has shown and which will help to make the European Union more independent; it is a step towards a decision full of political significance and one very much called for by our draft Constitution.

 Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, European space policy is becoming the spearhead of European policy as a whole, due to the hopes it engenders for cutting-edge research, for the new technologies, for the economy and for development. It must be realistic; in other words, it must make sense in the context of US and Russian space policy and act as a driving force for the European Union. I congratulate Mr Bodrato on his report, which has the merit of expressing this desire. We feel, however, that it focuses too much on military applications, which are not the intended aim of this policy. This is why we are proposing Galileo, which will be a purely civilian organisation, as opposed to the USA’s GPS system or the Russian Glonass, which are under military control. We propose to support Article 150 of the Convention under discussion, so that space forms part of European policy as a whole. A joint organisation must be set up at European level and the European Space Agency (ESA) must be more a tool of this integrated policy than an intergovernmental body. Work in the space sector must form part of the context of the European research area and the bulk of resources allocated to this field should be shared by the Union’s Member States. All players involved in space policy and in particular the European Parliament which supports our space policy must sit down at the same table. Our group will set great store by these proposals and will pay close attention when the White Paper on space, which is due to be submitted to us by the end of the year, is adopted.

 Mr Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy I voted against the directive on computer-implemented inventions, which remains a confused text, opening the door to the patentability of software. I am disappointed that the amendment to reject the directive tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance was not adopted: when a directive is badly drafted, I think that the Commission has a duty to redraft it. Nevertheless, I am delighted that there was excellent cooperation with other political groups, allowing us to improve the text, in particular in Article 2. In recent months, I have been approached by several researchers who are afraid that the software patent is putting the brakes on innovation in the European Union. At a time when we are doing everything we can to create a European area of research, it is absurd to adopt legislation that is condemned by the most eminent members of the EU’s scientific community, who sent a petition to me. Furthermore, software patents endanger free software, which is used in a number of scientific and industrial applications such as the European satellites in the Galileo system. Only a clear text guaranteeing the protection of computer programs by copyright could re-establish legal clarity in this field.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are keen to emphasise the importance of this special report on the common fisheries policy, because it highlights the special situation of the Mediterranean fisheries. I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur for the excellent quality of his work. The Mediterranean is a semi-enclosed sea. It forms an ecosystem, an entity in its own right, rich in its environment and in its culture. The problems involving the Mediterranean must be solved in the context of multilateral relations and the MEDA programmes, for which I am the rapporteur and which are true instruments of the European Union, set up by the 1995 Barcelona Convention, making it possible to take action from the point of view of sustainable development. MEDA must also take into account the economic, technical and environmental problems relating to fisheries. I should like to emphasise several points which are raised in Mr Lisi’s report and which I believe to be of major importance. First of all, in order to gain a knowledge of the region, it is essential to carry out a survey of the environment, the treatment of waste water, the development of coastal belts and the development of fisheries resources. In order to do this, considerable investment will have to be agreed on rapidly, to enable scientific research programmes to be implemented concerning the state of fish stocks and the prospects for development as a function of pressure from fishing. Secondly, fishing techniques must be studied in order to decide which ones are most suitable, taking into account, in particular, the size of the fish, which are often smaller in the Mediterranean than elsewhere, and smaller fish do not necessarily mean juveniles. Thirdly, we must protect and promote small-scale fishing, by which I mean non-industrial fishing, which is often coastal fishing and which is an important source of jobs besides treating fisheries resources with greater care than industrial fishing does. Fourthly, fishing is an occupation with many motivated and competent people in responsible positions, people who are highly experienced and who are concerned with preserving the ethics of fishing, and who do not hesitate to share their extremely interesting local experiences so that lessons may be learned from them. Regional fisheries committees, which serve as centres of consultation, and which take into account the needs of the profession, should be encouraged. Finally, as regards the Mediterranean Sea itself and the coastal lagoons, as well as the wetlands around them, we must seek to ensure greater respect for the environment so that fishing can continue to develop, particularly in the lagoons, such as the Etang de Thau
, whose Category A status it is absolutely essential to preserve. Only in this way is it possible to allow the continuation of extensive fishing, constantly taking into account health criteria which correspond to an environment of excellent quality, thereby avoiding any deterioration which would certainly occur if we encouraged only activities taking place out of the water, in particular the cleaning of shellfish.

 Mr President, I should first like to thank my colleagues who have worked so hard on this report, in particular Mrs De Keyser for her work on behalf of the AFET Committee and also Mrs Zrihen. I should also like to thank the European Commission and Mrs Gonzalo, who gave us all of the information that we needed. I would remind you that the MEDA programme is the tool through which our Mediterranean policy, as formulated in the Barcelona process in 1995, is implemented. The first phase was carried out by the MEDA I programme (1995-1999) and the second by the current MEDA II programme, which was shaped by my and Mr Valdivielso's reports in the year 2000. This new regulation entered into force on 15 December 2000 and we have been able to analyse how it has worked up to the end of 2002. The conclusions on MEDA I had given rise to numerous concerns, the overall payment-to-commitment ratio between 1995 and 1999 being only 26%. The main causes of this relative failure were identified as the length of the negotiations, the complexity of the programme's procedures, the multi-annual nature of some projects and the limited administrative capacity of the MEDA countries, together – it has to be said – with a lack of administrative resources in the committee in charge of managing this programme, obliging it to delegate work to Technical Assistance Offices, whose involvement proved to be ineffective. MEDA II is not restricted to fostering the creation of a free trade area in the Mediterranean by 2010, but enhances the previous economic cooperation in the Mediterranean with a social, cultural and environmental strand. For the period from 2000 to 2006 this programme has an overall budget of EUR 12.75 billion, made up of European Union funds and loans from the European Investment Bank. In summary, having analysed the situation in the documents that we have tabled, we would draw the following conclusions. Firstly, we note that MEDA II represents a marked improvement on MEDA I, thanks to the creation of the EuropeAid Cooperation Office in the External Relations DG. Thus, we have moved from an overall payment-to-commitment ratio of 26% in MEDA I to 37.4% in 2000, 53% in 2001 and 92.9% in 2002, an overall ratio for MEDA II of 59%. To achieve this, the Technical Assistance Offices have been dismantled and eight delegations have been set up (in Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the West Bank), with a representation only in Gaza. These delegations can take action more readily, as they have Commission representatives and clearly identified resource centres in each country. Secondly, the comitology has been simplified. A methodological guide was published in March 2002. Thirdly, as we have recommended several times, Parliament is very mindful of the links that need to be established between the granting of aid and the respect of human rights by the various countries, and we ask for an annual report on this. Fourthly, we want there to be regular monitoring of the observance of democratic principles when projects are chosen, not just through the bilateral negotiations between the Union and the countries concerned, but also involving civil society and NGOs in this process and ensuring that the gender criteria, in particular regarding the participation of women, are respected. Fifthly, we stress the need to further develop South-South relations and not just bilateral relations, which even today absorb more than 85% of funds. Sixthly, we take into account the work underway in the European Convention seeking to meet the five challenges for the MEDA countries: demography, employment and migration, globalisation, diminishing natural resources and the environment and human rights. Seventhly, we suggest that the sixth framework programme of research should be used for carrying out research in the fields of the environment, agriculture – with the aim of ensuring food sovereignty – and in particular water management, and suggest that more emphasis be put on renewable energies. We recall that the Mediterranean Basin has the greatest variety of agricultural specimens and seeds of all temperate areas: these must be preserved. We want more attention to be paid to agrodiversity and to implementing projects involving farmers, tradesmen, consumers and SMEs. Finally, we want all of the opportunities afforded by the information and communication society to be developed, in particular electronic communication. Finally, let us note that all of this work under MEDA is currently being done against the difficult background of the post-war situation in Iraq, the resolution of difficult problems in the Middle East, the peace process, in particular between Israel and Palestine, and the new balance established by the Treaty of Nice with enlargement to 25, and here we need to continue our efforts to ensure that this is not a pretext for sidelining Mediterranean cooperation. That is why we support the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean foundation for dialogue between cultures and civilisations, as well as a monitoring centre for migratory flows, a Euro-Mediterranean investment bank and a Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly, which would play a decisive role in formulating a properly implemented and well-integrated Euro-Mediterranean cooperation policy.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my responsibility, on behalf of the competent committee in this area, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, to draw up the report on the state of progress of the Galileo programme and the integration of the EGNOS programme into the Galileo programme. The first discussion within the competent committee, the ITRE committee, will take place on 21 May and the report will be discussed in plenary in November. Given the problems you have highlighted, Commissioner, I would like, if I may, to speak on behalf of the ITRE Committee and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to remind us all of the timetable for implementing Galileo: autumn 2002, the Galileo Joint Undertaking becomes operative; end of 2002, Commission report to the Council on the integration of the EGNOS programme into the Galileo programme and the concession model; December 2002, Council decision on the services provided by Galileo and the frequency service plan; July 2003, World Radiocommunications Conference; summer 2003, Commission proposal to the Council on the creation of the future security body; autumn 2003, Commission report to the Council on the preselection of the future concessionaire; end of 2004, launch of the first experimental satellite. If we want to adhere to this timetable, we now urgently need to overcome the impasse that has arisen within the ESA, where the Member States are divided over the importance each has in the programme. It is understandable that the Member States concerned want to have their say, but it is rather a nuisance, since, for the sake of 1% or 2% of their participation, we are in danger of considerably delaying the implementation of this project, which genuinely has a European dimension. We are aware of the need for technology that is equivalent to or better than GPS. As we saw with Commissioner Busquin, substantial research has been carried out with a view to achieving extraordinary technology, which will be even better than GPS technology. It will comprise environmental applications, which will also be essential. We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance feel strongly that the project should be transparent, and we do not want it to be carried out in haste because of a delay. We are extremely concerned that the Galileo project should have civil, rather than military, applications. We therefore consider that it should be implemented swiftly. More than 200 Members of Parliament signed a motion in April against a delay and in favour of speeding up the implementation of the project. I would be grateful, Commissioner, if you could do all you can to ensure that progress is made in this direction and to overcome the impasse as swiftly as possible.

 Mr President, first of all I very much wish to congratulate Gérard Caudron on his report concerning the first application of Article 169 of the Treaty to the Sixth Framework Research and Development Programme. His work has certainly fostered excellent cooperation between us and has facilitated the success of this excellent proposal. This is due to the courageous initiative taken by Commissioner Busquin, and involves allocating a total of EUR 600 million to large-scale research with the objective of combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis under the EDCTP programme. Because of the importance of that objective and the means being implemented to achieve it, it is vital for us to stress that basic ethical standards need to be respected in relation to this research. We equally need to emphasise that the results of that research should be available for use in the general interest, and that we need to cooperate with developing countries and encourage scientific and technical development in those countries. The ethical principles in question are those set out in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and those defined in the World Medical Association’s Helsinki Declaration on ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects. The European and Developing countries Clinical Trials Partnership must apply the good clinical practice defined in Directive 2001/20/EC on the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use in the European Union. The EDCTP programme should encourage the training of specialists and capacity building in developing countries, step up technology transfer to those countries and mobilise additional resources for the fight against these diseases. The Community will ensure that these strategic decisions and the implementation of programmes are in line with the objective of placing on the market products that are at the same time effective, accessible at the lowest possible price and easy to use, and adapted to the specific conditions prevailing in developing countries. These decisions should be based on the active participation of stakeholders from the developing countries, scientific experts from the North and the South, representatives of patient groups, and the NGOs and the WHO. Finally, our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance hopes that the results obtained through this programme will be considered a public good, and will therefore not be subject to intellectual property rules such as those defined in the TRIPS agreements, so as to guarantee developing countries access to the treatments resulting from this research at the lowest possible price.

 Mr President, I welcome the in-depth work carried out by Mr Whitehead, Mrs Patrie and Mrs Thyssen concerning the implications of the Green Paper on consumer protection. We agree with the request to establish simpler, more targeted legislative measures in order to facilitate the implementation of the legislative arsenal applicable to the internal market which, in our opinion, lacks transparency and is too fragmented to instil confidence in consumers. We have seen with satisfaction the concept of citizen-consumers appearing and I would point out that their fundamental rights are the right to safety, information, free choice, representation, avenues of recourse, satisfaction and an unpolluted environment. Consumption in future must take account of the three pillars of sustainable development, the economic, environmental and social factors, although the latter two are all too often neglected. I propose that we consider the feasibility of a general directive on the environmental quality of consumer services and products, giving particular consideration to the need for a European label and for a high degree of protection. We believe citizen-consumers must play an essential part, not just as customers but as decision-makers too, as proactive consumers concerned at an ethical level with the product they are consuming. In this regard, they will become one of the main, essential players in this development, which we would like to be long term.

 Mr President, the provisions which will be put to the vote on Thursday will form the principal CFP regulation for the next ten years and will represent the arrangements for fishing subsidies and the creation of an emergency fund designed to resolve the problem of overcapacity of the Union’s fleets. It is up to the Member States to decide on their plan of action during this time. I would like to make a plea for small-scale fishing, which affects the most jobs and enables many families of traditional fishermen to survive. Until now, it has primarily been industrial fishing which has been increasingly encouraged, and I thank Commissioner Fischler for the proposals that he made in his presentation on the general policy in this area. First of all, when FIFG subsidies are used to build increasingly large and increasingly powerful boats, the Member States, of course, encourage a greater and less selective fishing, which has a detrimental effect on small tradesmen, who are concerned with preserving efficient boats that are kept in good condition and which therefore provide good levels of safety without damaging the marine environment. We would like more money to be granted to businesses, particularly from the Structural Funds. This money must also be used to buy better equipment, not to destroy boats. We should also, for example, give small, less powerful boats access to reserved areas to be used as their main resource. The Member States could implement similar measures to encourage access to markets in which small-scale fishermen, whose activities are less well structured than large-scale fishermen, have less influence in the area of management. For example, aid can be given to fisheries and to fish auctions. As regards the representation of fishermen in Commission advisory councils, we must encourage small businesses. We should increase the representation of traditional fishermen, particularly within regional fishing committees, in which professional associations can express their views. The industrial tribunals in the Mediterranean are a good example of this. They could thus defend their interests more forcefully. Lastly, it is always the large-scale fishermen who can go further, to Africa, for example to Senegal where species are fished to a greater degree, or to other countries whose fisheries resources are essential for the local economy. They contribute to the depletion of stocks, which is harmful for both local fishermen and fishermen all over the world. These are some proposals, therefore, that we can make to encourage small-scale fishing.

 Subsidies to large agricultural holdings in Europe are restricting agricultural production levels from small holdings in Europe and also those from developing countries which are not capable of contending with such competition. The CAP must be revised in this area by including all the measures that are likely to enable these countries to develop a competitive agricultural industry with respect to production costs, and also product quality. We will therefore ensure respect for the environment so that its degradation does not lead to the degradation of farmland, particularly compared to intensive farming, the intensive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, the pollution of agricultural produce by GMOs. We will therefore be able to safeguard a healthy and organic production. Particular attention will be paid to these issues, especially by means of collaboration with the common research centre. The preservation and rational use of water resources are also of the greatest importance for these countries. The Short and Medium-Term Priority Action Programme 
(SMAP) and MEDA programme and all the other programmes to enhance cooperation between the European Union and third countries could also be developed in this area.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance was very anxious to see the implementation of the framework programme simplified and – let us be honest – humanised. The report by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, whom I should like to thank most sincerely for taking on the task and for the provisions full of common sense which she has included regarding the rules for participation, has set us on the right track. I should like to emphasise that, for the first time in the framework programme, the acceding countries will enjoy rights that are equivalent to those of the Member States, and the European scientific cooperation organisations and those of the acceding countries will be able to participate on the same footing as the bodies established in the Member States. I am also pleased to see that the organisations in third countries will be able to participate fully in the projects in the framework programme. This is particularly important for our group, which wants to intensify research with developing countries and with the countries of the Mediterranean and of Latin America. Taking into account the new management provisions – provided, in particular, by the new tools – it will certainly be necessary to optimise operations during the implementation of this programme, but without, however, opting for formal conciliation procedures. With this in mind, we should like to thank the Council, as represented by Mr Marimón, who has devoted a lot of attention to this matter, for having agreed to our proposal intended to speed things up. This is why we would be happy to maintain regular contact between Parliament and the Commission, which will in fact be possible thanks to the kind competence of Mr Busquin, in particular with a view to the possible updating of the evaluations at the halfway point, in 2004.

 Madam President, on the subject of fisheries, this report does not carry out a detailed analysis of the overall advantages of the structural funds and of the amounts allocated for each programme, for example the management of fishing fleets, decommissioning, fish farming etc. The Green Paper asks whether the FIFG has contributed to the sustainability of fish stocks or whether it has introduced a distortion into the industry. Have all the resources allocated to the restructuring of the fleet contributed to the creation of a fleet which has selective fishing methods, high-quality products and a maximum employment rate, or have they simply had the effect of speeding up the process of industrialisation, squeezing out the small vessels and turning them into large vessels, with all the social and economic consequences that that implies? The Commission will have to try to answer this question during the current debate on the common fisheries policy.

 Mr President, I am going to be presenting the non-nuclear section of the report on the Joint Research Centre (JRC), which represents two thirds of its budget. In the Sixth Framework Programme, the Joint Research Centre will be refocusing its activities so as to strengthen its organisational role and participate usefully in the European Research Area. Its work programme has three distinguishing characteristics: concentration, openness and networking, and consumer-orientation. To this end, the Joint Research Centre has restructured its non-nuclear activities around two main areas, supported by specialist skills: food, chemical products and health, and sustainable environment and development. These areas will be supplemented by horizontal activities: technology foresight, reference materials and measurements, and public security and anti-fraud. The total budget allocated to the JRC’s activities stands at EUR 760 million. Its decision to adopt this new strategy and restructure its services was inspired by a report published last year by a high-level working party chaired by Étienne Davignon. These changes are intended to make the Joint Research Centre better adapted to the needs of political decision-makers and privileged users: the Council, Commission Directorates-General and Parliament. The JRC will also be active in giving impetus to the European Research Area and the Sixth Framework Programme. It will work on setting up a Community system to harmonise measurements and will participate in European and global networks. The JRC will be a high-profile player throughout the implementation of the Sixth Framework Programme, in terms of participating in both networks of excellence and integrated projects. It will be able to make an active contribution to developing the new European citizenship by providing a common knowledge base of scientific and technological references and by facilitating dialogue between scientists and decision-makers. It will also be expected to help with the ‘operational’ implementation of the new tools, including the stairways of excellence – as far as it is competent to do so, of course – and with integrating research into local development. In certain thematic areas, proposals from the Joint Research Centre would appear to be essential for specifying the public contracts that may be awarded, for example in the sustainable development sector. This sector encompasses all of the issues relating to ecosystems. For example, the JRC has spent more than a year and a half working on establishing the criteria for ecosites and will help to set up a European network. This also applies to food safety, where the JRC will help to establish a reference and standardisation system, and to the protection of individual privacy in information and communication technologies. The Joint Research Centre’s role as an advisor on European policy needs to be enhanced. It is improving networking and cooperation with public and private institutions in the Member States. It is also finalising a human resources and mobility plan, which involves in particular training young scientists and arranging exchanges with national research institutions. The point is not that it should become a research centre competing with other centres to research the scientific questions at issue in several Member States, but that it should ensure linkage between these centres when it comes to implementing the results and achieving the objectives of European directives. In the same way, the Commission must be able to turn to it for the most rapid response possible. It therefore needs to have teams that are capable of adjusting readily to requests made and reacting immediately. To do so, they must have knowledge of their fields permanently at their fingertips, keep up to date with upstream research, and even carry out additional research in areas that have not been covered by the national institutes. The JRC has an important part to play in the process of opening the programme up to the accession countries, to the countries of the Mediterranean region and to those involved in international cooperation under the MEDA and TACIS programmes. Let us not forget either the role of mediator that the Joint Research Centre has been called to play in the risk-management sector, on issues such as risk exposure, impact assessment, damages, and nuclear safety and waste problems, creating synergy in particular with the initiatives launched under the EUR-OPA Major Risks programme. The Centre should further develop its work on implementing practical projects on saving energy, in particular in the construction sector, and on renewable energies. It must not confine itself to research on photovoltaic energy, but must also promote demonstration projects in other areas, such as wind energy. It might also monitor the assessment of the introduction of fuel cells. Given the growing popularity of organic food products and traditional, locally-grown produce, the JRC will develop methods to ensure their authenticity and quality. It will also study ways of optimising their impact on the environment and local development. Finally, to make it possible for us to provide better guidance and if necessary to refocus particular studies in accordance with political developments on science, I think that it would be desirable for a monitoring committee to be set up that is in contact with Parliament, so that we would be kept abreast of its activities on a more regular basis, which would allow us to build on the fruitful exchanges we have had so far. In conclusion, the Joint Research Centre’s main objectives will therefore be to remain close to its users – the European Parliament and the Commission – to develop its role as a recognised centre of excellence on issues of safety, health and the environment, and to develop its activities as a promoter of research networks. The Joint Research Centre can therefore be expected to make a success of its commitment to reform and to justify its unique position within the European Commission. I should like to thank Commissioner Busquin and his services for having done all they could to help us to prepare this report and its conclusions which we are presenting to you today.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as far as the common fisheries policy is concerned, we have been advocating vigilance and practical measures, stock management and the preservation of the marine environment for several years now. Most of the governments have not given a reaction to these proposals, which aim to sustain fisheries in the future. Now that we can see stocks are being exhausted – between one and two thirds of hake, cod and whiting have disappeared – we now have our backs to the wall. We must therefore thoroughly reform the instrument, which must become less aggressive and more selective, to avoid, in particular, by-catches which sometimes make up 80% of a haul, including juvenile fish. Each Member State will apply this European directive, which has been drawn up in the general interest, in the way it considers best. Instead of quite devastating industrial fishing practices, we, the Greens, are calling for coastal fishing that is more capable of safeguarding jobs. Considerably greater sums than those currently allocated to cover the social compensation of this policy will certainly need to be made available. We are not in favour of taking blind administrative steps. These must be determined in conjunction with the Regional Advisory Councils proposed by the Commission, made up of professionals, labour experts, scientists and civil societies that can adapt them to the specific problems on the ground. This should enable us not only to salvage something from this situation but, more importantly, to provide the fishing industry with a new impetus and the sustainable development that is essential to our economic as well as human stability.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to extend our thanks to Mr Caudron, our rapporteur, as well as to our shadow rapporteurs. Mr Caudron was very willing to listen to our views and it was a pleasure for us to work with him in drawing up the Sixth Framework Programme. As far as the Council is concerned, I must also thank the Belgian Presidency, represented by Mr de Donnea, who worked hard to include the proposals that Parliament, in particular, desired, and I would also thank the current Spanish Presidency. The fact remains, however, that the person who most influenced the Sixth Framework Programme was undoubtedly Commissioner Busquin. I would like to pay tribute to him and thank him, because he was always very open to our proposals. He considered them in a professional and sensitive manner. I would like to give him my sincere thanks for his contribution to the Sixth Framework Programme to establish the European Research Area – it was his idea – and the new instruments, such as integrated networks, networks of excellence, integrated projects and the stairway to excellence. We shall, of course, discuss the various themes. There is the difficult issue of ethics which I do not wish to tackle, as this is an area of concern for us. There appears to be a majority of Green Members in favour of rejecting the amendment on ethics. We are concerned by this serious issue and we must be aware that European scientists as well as the public look to us when we take decisions in this area. I recognise that the question of the use of embryos for research purposes is a very personal question, that there are Members in each group who are in favour and against their use. It is no secret that there are different opinions, even within our group. However, we must bear in mind that Parliament, at first reading, adopted an amendment whose aim was to restrict research activities in this highly sensitive area. It seems likely, at the current time, that Parliament will accept the Council’s proposal not to deal with ethics in detail in the Framework Programme and if we accept the Council’s proposal, we are essentially recognising that ethical issues must be dealt with by the experts, by scientists, by the Commission, and not by ourselves, the politicians. There may be good reasons for accepting the compromise and it is up to each of us to decide if it is better to avoid conciliation or to find a satisfactory solution to ethical issues. All I can say to you now is that when we meet the members of our groups to discuss the issue of ethics, we must not forget that the public believes that these are political issues for which we, as politicians, are responsible: we cannot delegate this responsibility. We have further reasons to welcome this Framework Programme: the theme of sustainable development has been included for the first time and has been given a substantial budget, more than EUR 2.2 billion; research into energy, within the framework of renewable energy, is on a par with research into nuclear energy; sustainable transport and research into urban and rural ecosystems, with, in particular, an ‘ecosite’ concept, are new themes which were accepted. We are also pleased with the appropriations which were added for international relations, particularly for the science/society theme. It is now up to us to optimise the Sixth Framework Programme through these very specific programmes which will be developed, as the Commission promised, and on which we shall report back very soon.

 With regard to the Kindermann report, we believe that it is vitally important and a matter of regret that this regulation is not included, like the four other proposals by the Commission, within the co-decision framework. The proposal for a regulation is based on Article 37, relating to the common agricultural policy and aims to put in place more rational legislation to avoid the contamination of farm animals by products of animal origin containing pathogenic agents. We all remember the food-and-mouth epidemic which recently struck Europe and the ensuing crisis within the agricultural industry, primarily in the United Kingdom. Initial enquiries confirm that the contamination was caused by food of animal origin from third countries, which was used for pig feed. As far as animal-health conditions governing the production and sale of Community products are concerned, we must carry out careful and regular monitoring of the health state of producing regions. Official controls and Community inspections must be carried out without prior warning. So that we have the resources required, we must consider – as Mr Kindermann said – how many vets are needed in the Member States, as well as at the European Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin. In addition, our legal mechanism must take into account the candidate countries and we must make penalties uniform. As regards imports from third countries, we must have the same provisions as for Member States. However, overly strict hygiene measures must not be perceived as barriers to trade. If that is the case, we should make adjustments but continue to bear in mind the original aim of the regulation. We support Mr Kindermann’s report, which provides the necessary clarifications to the Commission proposal.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance takes a positive overall view of the report by Mr Glante. It is not a question of deciding whether or not to approve the Galileo project. This has already been decided in the report by Mrs Langenhagen, as she herself has just pointed out, and I myself gave a favourable opinion on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. Our objective is now to decide how to manage the project’s development phase. We agree with the rapporteur’s proposal to create a Joint Undertaking whose shareholders would be the European Union and the ESA, an undertaking which would be dissolved once the development phase is completed. We also agree with his proposal to create, alongside that, a development company in which the private sector will participate. It will enable conflicts of interest to be avoided whilst drafting the specification and the tendering procedure during the deployment phase. The Undertaking will not therefore be judge and judged. We do not believe that the proposed monitoring committee will serve a useful purpose, since the Member States are already represented in the Joint Undertaking. However, we are in favour of setting up a committee with an ethical purpose, whose opinions will be consulted and which will ensure that Galileo is used properly and in accordance with the principles laid down by Parliament. Lastly, we do not agree with the amendments tabled by Mr Radwan, which reintroduce the concept of Galileo being used for military applications, even occasionally, on the pretext that this could be done for humanitarian ends. If this amendment received a favourable vote, we could not vote for the report thus amended. To sum up, if the use of Galileo for military applications is not reintroduced by any means whatsoever, we will vote in favour of the report by Mr Glante, in its current form, unless the monitoring committee concerned, which we recommended setting up in the first report, does not have an ethical purpose.

 I would like to emphasise the points that must be considered to enable us genuinely to take the Mediterranean into account in the common fisheries policy. We must introduce an integrated policy through genuine cooperation at international level, whilst striving hard not to give in to a lax attitude, which would have a detrimental effect on our work. This can be achieved by revising existing legislation, namely Regulation (EC) No 1626/94, and by adapting the regulation on minimum landing sizes, technical measures and fishing gear to each region. We must also carry out in-depth research to enable us to develop an accurate idea as to the potential of anchovy, mackerel, blue-finned tunny and other fish; in other words, how much fishing effort can be supported by the various species. We can do this by paying greater attention to the members of the Mediterranean-specific industrial tribunals and by stepping up the activities of the Regional Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean, which must be given effective jurisdiction and resources so that it can take action, both in terms of deep sea and inshore fishing. I would like to thank our excellent rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, as well as my colleagues, Mrs Langenhagen and Mrs McKenna, for visiting the Mediterranean coast, particularly Sète, Mèze and Port-la-Nouvelle, for supporting these proposals and for coming to find out what the situation is on the ground.

 Mr President, Commissioner, today being the anniversary of the sinking of the Erika
 on 12 December 1999, my group and I are pleased to see that conciliation on three sets of proposals has been successful. Concerning the Watts report, we are particularly pleased that the European Parliament’s delegation succeeded in making black boxes compulsory, which was not the easiest thing to do. This means that, from now on, a ship will be detained if it is not fitted with a functioning VDR system. With regard to Mr Ortuondo Larrea’s report, the question of the conflict of interests has been resolved in such a way that classification societies can no longer have any links with shipbuilders, shipowners, operators or charterers. Likewise, there is the question of the limits of the financial liability of these companies with regard to the financial balance of recognised organisations. There is also the problem that Mr Souchet mentioned of providing compensation payments from the IOPC Fund or from a European fund in a more efficient manner. It is also a matter of urgency, as Mr Hatzidakis said, to settle, at third reading, the problem of single hull ships, mainly in view of the 2015 deadline, as maritime safety issues cannot wait any longer – it is already two years to the day since the sinking of the Erika
. Intermittent spills and substandard ‘dustbin ships’, such as the one that recently sunk off the coast of Brest, are still all too topical and it is a test of the EU’s credibility to resolve this situation once and for all.

 Mr President, I would first like to thank Commissioner Busquin for the way these proposals were prepared, for listening to the views of others and for his excellent collaboration. I would also like to extend my sincere thanks to Gérard Caudron. He listened attentively to all the political groups and to the shadow rapporteurs, and others. We have worked very well together. I believe that he did everything he could have done. Although there have been differences of opinion on some conclusions, the work was completed to a high standard. My thanks also go to my fellow shadow rapporteurs. In my opinion, this report on the Sixth Framework Programme on European Research is the big report of the moment, despite its faults. It has European added value, it is innovative as the Commissioner wished, it has networks of excellence and integrated projects. We have a lot to do. We have also made significant progress on matters concerning young people, grants and women and preventing brain drains. We cannot ignore all the innovative proposals in the Sixth Framework programme. There are three issues of great concern to the Greens. Firstly, the ethical questions. We do not want the European Union to fund the modification of the human genetic inheritance and the creation of human embryos for therapeutic reasons. We also want to see a ban on financing research using supernumerary human embryos and the stem cells of supernumerary embryos. From what I have heard, I think all the political groups will reach a compromise on these points. Secondly, we would like to see an assessment of the effects of new technologies, like electromagnetic radiation for example, on populations, on health and so on. Thirdly, we would like to achieve a fairer balance between research on renewable energies and research on nuclear energy. I would like to reiterate the sentiments of Eryl MacNally. We do not want to see an increase in the nuclear energy or the ITER project budgets. That is very long term. We would however like research credits for renewable energy to be more on a par with those for nuclear energy.

Mooring services are a general interest service as recognised by the judgment of the Court of Luxembourg of 18 June 1998. Within this context, the port authority may require mooring services to handle any safety problems with no obligation for remuneration. Mooring services provide all ships with the same quality of service, due to an extremely extensive knowledge of the port in which the service is provided. The permanent nature of the service, the professional qualifications of the workers, their knowledge of the specific local features and the essential role played by mooring services in port and maritime safety make this activity an essential determining factor in environmental protection. The deterioration of the merchant fleet as a whole and the increasing over-use of frequently faulty boats and equipment show the extent of the essential role to be played by mooring service providers in years to come, due to their technical skills and wide knowledge of their place of work. Mooring services, like piloting, must therefore be excluded from the European directive, and that is why the group of the Greens has voted in favour of Amendments No 66 and 67 of this report.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we would like to give our opinion on the GALILEO programme, taking into account the decisions made, namely by the Stockholm European Council on 23 March 2001. At this Council meeting, great emphasis was placed on the need to launch this satellite navigation programme immediately. Our Committee acknowledges the benefits of such a programme, the main feature of which is that it is European as well as civilian in nature, and is therefore independent of systems developed by the military, such as the American GPS and Russian GLONASS systems, and that is reliable and has greater precision than these two existing systems. We are proposing, however, that the following points be implemented during the development and validation phase from 2001 to 2005, the deployment phase from 2006 to 2007, and the operation phase, which begins in 2008, essentially under the aegis of the European Space Agency and the Commission. First of all, we must accurately monitor the funding, initially estimated to be in the region of EUR three billion, as well as the partners chosen, particularly private industries, and their involvement. We must also carry out an in-depth analysis of the cost-effectiveness and the implications for the economy and employment. We are demanding the greatest level of transparency in this matter and to receive regular information from Parliament. Secondly, we stress the fact that the structures established during the development of the programme should be used solely for civilian purposes, and we point out that it is vital, in this case, to develop the use of space for purposes related to the general interest and public service. Thirdly, the GALILEO programme must not be applied in such a way that will jeopardise the right to or the protection of privacy and it must not under any circumstances be used for the surveillance of citizens. It must, in particular, be developed in order to protect and safeguard the environment, to protect the lives of citizens and natural resources, and ensure early detection and even prevention of natural or man-made disasters. It must also contribute to progress in European research, when drawing up the future Sixth Framework Programme. Lastly, we are proposing – and this is important – to set up an advisory ethics committee, whose task would be to ensure respect for the aforementioned requirements and which would assist the Commission and the European Space Agency in their decision-making duties. I want to emphasise – and I call on Mrs De Palacio to give us her point of view – the fact that it will be civilian organisations that set up the system. Of course, we cannot say that, ‘we will not vote in favour of GALILEO if it is used by the military in the future’, because, when we set up transport and communication systems, for instance, anyone can use them. What matters is that Europe is independent and that it is not dependent on the USSR or the US. We believe that these various provisions are realistic conditions, which must accompany and justify GALILEO, and we would also hope to hear Mrs De Palacio’s point of view on setting up the ethics committee.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the Commissioner, both for his statement and for the ongoing debate with us which he puts himself through, as we ask him a great deal of questions, but gradually we have what is needed in order to do our work, and I believe that the seminar due to take place on 5 June 2001 will provide us with further information. I would also like to emphasise the need to create a European Research Area, and the need for the innovation that this represents, to make the Sixth Framework Programme more flexible and easier to access. I am thinking, in particular, of the European added value, which we will find if there is more interaction between the countries of the European Union, namely through grants provided to young people so that they can go and carry out research and work in other Member States and discover more about themselves. We must also be able to maintain the values and the knowledge that we have in Europe and not just watch these go elsewhere. Lastly, with regard to the specific programmes, I would like to emphasise innovation, this time in the area of sustainable development. This is an important subject, which we discuss a great deal, but it is an area in which still too little is done. I would like to draw my fellow Members’ attention to the fact that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is organising a meeting on this issue in Parliament, in Brussels and this will take place next week on 6 June. We would like to invite all Members to come and share their views on sustainable development, energy, renewable energy, the environment and ecology in particular, so that we can take these into account and make some proposals in this area which is of great interest to us.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the most sought-after species of fish in the world are those which are referred to as “highly migratory”, including the commercially important species of tunas and billfishes (swordfish, marlin, sailfish). Large quantities of these species are caught: in 1997, 3.5 million tonnes of highly migratory species were taken in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans combined. The European Union was a very active participant in these fisheries throughout the oceans of the world. Vessels flying the flags of different Member States accounted for over 400 000 tonnes in 1997, second only to Japan. Several regional fisheries organisations have been established to regulate fisheries for these species: the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), covering the eastern tropical Pacific, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC). The EU belongs to both the ICCAT and the IOTC and has applied for membership of the IATTC. These international organisations adopt recommendations regarding, among other things, technical measures on minimum size and weight, time and/or area closures, restrictions on certain gear types or fishing practices and limits to the capacity of some fleets. At present, these measures are scattered throughout a number of regulations. The sensible aim of the Commission’s proposal is to draw together, in one regulation, all the technical measures relating to highly migratory species. Some of them have been in effect for many years while others were only adopted by the regional organisations at the most recent meetings held just last autumn, and we have taken these into account in our report. The simplest and most objective way to evaluate the efficacy of the technical measures is to look at the status of the stocks which they are meant to conserve. Many, if not most, of the important tuna and billfish stocks in the Atlantic are in bad shape. According to the 2000 Report of the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) of ICCAT, the spawning stock biomass of bigeye tuna has suffered rapid declines over the past five years and the current levels of fishing cannot be sustained – further declines are anticipated. Of the major stocks, only skipjack is not thought to be over-exploited. In summary, management of the tuna and billfish stocks in the Atlantic has been more notable for its failures than its successes and, as the most important fishing power in the region, the European Union must accept its share of the responsibility. Each of the three ocean areas are experiencing similar problems, which is not surprising considering the high mobility of not only the tuna and billfish but also the fleets which exploit them. The problem of excessive fishing effort has been noted, and catches of small fish must be monitored in particular. As regards excessive effort: some form of vessel register is being created in each area as an initial step to limiting capacity. These are new initiatives, so it is too soon to evaluate their effectiveness, and they will undoubtedly not be enough to have an impact on the extensive overfishing of stocks such as bluefin. As regards catches of small fish, the ever more popular practice of setting purse seines on FADs, rather than free-swimming schools of tuna, has led to high exploitation of juvenile tuna. The simple expedient of imposing a minimum landing size has been demonstrated in ICCAT to be totally ineffective. Limited closed areas and seasons may offer some protection but they have proved difficult to implement. The IATTC plan for compulsory retention on board may be more useful but that solution is not presently viable in other areas as it is only in the Eastern Pacific that all large seiners have observers. Finally, unless a way is found to eliminate fishing by vessels flying flags of convenience (FOC), all the other efforts proposed will come to nothing. In conclusion, I would draw your attention to two other comments which should be made. Firstly, the special attention which should be paid in order to also reduce by-catch, other than that involving juvenile fish, which is often the result of longlining and purse seining. ICCAT is taking action on this, and other organisations should also be addressing this problem. The final problem is that of authorising certain countries, which do not currently have quotas, to fish in their exclusive economic zone, their EEZ. They, quite naturally, wish to be allowed to fish the stocks within their waters, but in that case it would be logical for the European Union to reduce its share of the catch, which it has so far refused to do. The EU must be more flexible on this question.

 Madam President, the establishment of a European Research Area is a truly innovative idea, which Commissioner Busquin proposes to make a reality over the next few years. We are grateful to him for that and I want to congratulate him personally, just as I want to congratulate Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel on the excellent report she has drawn up on the subject. Of course, we are in favour of this idea, and we would like to point out the aspects that the Group of the Verts/ALE considers most important. First, we must move towards closer European integration in research. We want national programmes to be more accessible at European level. Point two, this European Research Area must focus on sound basic research carried out by public establishments and it must be accompanied by a European innovation area that is geared to enterprises, be they large, small or medium-sized. At each step, we must try to create a real European added value. Three, we must also consider introducing new tools. It is clear that the Sixth Framework Programme we are beginning to work on is the most important one. We must renew it and make it more accessible, more flexible and more legible. We must look into the idea of integrated programmes, of networks of excellence, but, at the same time, we must not forget the smaller entities, which can act as sources of discovery and innovation. Four, we are aware of the need to develop means of promoting exchanges, such as grants, to invest in young people and to create a balance, giving more time to research. Five, we must continue to promote pure science. We would like to see more attention paid to the subject of sciences and society and more support given to the human and social sciences. Six, the European Research Area must place more emphasis on sustainable development, by drawing up very concrete research projects, such as projects relating to the environment or to renewable energies. But we are not in favour of the inclusion of military research or research in the defence area. Finally, my seventh point, we are paying close attention to the international aspect, which is not just a question of competition with the United States or Japan and which must take account of the candidate countries and the cooperation programmes with the developing countries and the Euro-Mediterranean countries.

 Mr President, the concern of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy stems from the legal disputes with the United States and Canada concerning the European Union’s obligations in the context of the WTO and the application of the precautionary principle, to which we attach great importance. On the basis of the opinion delivered by the Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health, the SCVPH, we have called for moves to ban oestradiol 17β, a recognised carcinogen. In general, our amendments to the Commission’s proposals are designed to encourage the Commission to adopt a more dynamic approach by seeking and developing its own scientific information with a view to avoiding any impression that the EU is seeking only to gain time and intends to continue using the current lack of adequate scientific information to maintain its provisional measures in force indefinitely. It is therefore important that the provisional ban on the five other identified hormones, namely testosterone, progesterone, trenbolone acetate, zeranol and melengestrol acetate, should apply until the Community finds more complete scientific information from any source – particularly by means of a research programme of its own in this field – which could shed light on the gaps in the present state of knowledge on these substances and enable the EU to take a sufficiently well-founded decision to continue or lift the ban. As far as these substances too are concerned, we also want the Commission to accept the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee which was established by Article 1 of Decision 68/361/EEC and to make every effort to obtain further information in order to resolve this problem within a reasonable time. I must emphasise that these proposals are designed to promote a European agricultural system which is respectful of the environment, of animal welfare and of human health.

 Mr President, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has on several occasions made considerable contributions to the debate on the European Union’s Mediterranean policy and on reinvigorating the 1995 Barcelona Process. We played a major part in the discussion on the MEDA activity report that I presented on 5 September 2000, which was adopted almost unanimously by Parliament, as was, moreover, the amendment of the MEDA Regulation (MEDA II). We would have liked the meeting at Feira to refer to the MEDA programme, since it is the main instrument for implementing this policy and will be allocated a financial package of EUR 5.37 billion for the period 2000-2006, excluding funds from the European Investment Bank. Furthermore, we hope that this budget will be increased, as European Union Mediterranean policy should not have to suffer because of the appropriations that have been legitimately allocated to the Balkans. All the debates, regardless of the committee in which they are held, whether it be Foreign Affairs, Industry, Agriculture or Culture, or in Parliament, are unanimous in constantly reiterating the same recommendations. As far as we are concerned, we would like to stress, first of all, the need to define a Mediterranean strategy, in conjunction with third countries. Secondly, the need to develop decentralised cooperation that aims to enable contracts with local authorities and civil society, particularly NGOs, for both cross-border regions and in the South-South context, as well as for regional integration. Thirdly, we should like to highlight the decision of Parliament and the Commission to carry out an annual assessment of the human rights situation in signatory countries. My fourth point is to stress the urgent need to adopt the Charter for Security and Stability so that we can play a more active role, particularly in restoring peace in the Middle East. We consider it particularly important to encourage local measures and sustainable development, although this was omitted from the Feira Council conclusions, and to carry out progressive evaluation in this area, to implement major programmes on the environment and water, to reinvigorate the Start programme, and for third countries of the Mediterranean region to take part in the Sixth Research Framework Programme of research and technological development. The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy gave its unanimous opinion on this range of questions.

 Mr President, European Union fisheries policy is a vast subject. I would like to tackle it from the point of view of globalisation and in relation to the specific problem of Guinea-Bissau. As far as the Group of the Greens is concerned, I would remind you that we are in favour of a fisheries policy that respects the natural balance, in favour of developing offshore and inshore fishing, which creates jobs, and in favour of selective fishing, which takes account of available stocks. This is a question of achieving economic growth to satisfy businesses as well as protecting social aspects. We are against granting subsidies that encourage excessive industrial fishing, which catches everything indiscriminately, to the point of wiping out species and harming food safety and biodiversity, a fisheries policy which allows fleets to grow out of all proportion, and so forth. Because of this, we consider that untrammelled market forces represent one of the factors leading to such over-investment and that these issues should be taken into consideration in the next round of WTO trade negotiations on liberalisation. We therefore request that the Commission present appropriate proposals, both on the issue of the future direction of the subsidised sectors and on social aspects to the other members of the WTO. Furthermore, we are, generally, not particularly in favour of the bilateral fishing agreements between the European Union and third countries, often small countries, whose entire budgets are occasionally no larger than the subsidies granted them. It is essential that we remain as integrated as possible. However, we accept that a reserve of EUR 6.5 million was allocated to Guinea-Bissau, given that it is assigned to an action programme which will support the local fishing industry, infrastructure and controls and that a detailed report on how these funds are being used will be submitted to Parliament.

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, this first package of directives on maritime safety is without doubt one of the most important actions our House is going to implement in the course of 2000. France may have been especially hit by various maritime disasters, in particular by the recent wrecks of the Erika
 and the Ievoli Sun 
off the coast of Brittany, nevertheless what is at stake is the responsibility of the entire European Union, which managed to draw the necessary conclusions. The European Union has demonstrated its willingness to accept responsibility by putting forward strong proposals aimed at avoiding a recurrence of such serious accidents. I thank Mr Gayssot who, on behalf of the French Presidency, has shown great conviction and skill in dealing with these issues effectively. Nonetheless, we must be aware that these proposals which, as highlighted by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, are essentially a response to the legal requirements which have been identified in the areas defined by their respective objectives will only be effective insofar as they are correctly implemented by the Member States and monitored by the Commission. I would therefore like to highlight the points which, I feel, cannot be ignored if, following the adoption of these regulations and this directive, the expected progress is to be achieved. First of all, the action of Member States must be translated into action integrated at European level. We must deploy adequate numbers of properly trained people, used to cooperation, whatever their country of origin, and to using similar equipment. I am convinced that this will mean, in the longer term, the establishment of a European coastguard. I expect a great deal from the second series of proposals and from the establishment of a European maritime safety agency. It is at this level that, in one way or another, this indispensable European cooperation must be found. In the meantime, we must, at all costs, eliminate ships whose characteristics give cause for the gravest concern, and this means we must demand transparent intervention on the part of the inspection authorities, who must take measures against ships in a poor condition, irrespective of their age and structure, in line with a significant minimum target factor. We must refuse to permit ships to transit the 200-mile exclusive economic zone if they are not equipped with an IMO-compliant voyage data recorder (VDR) intended to provide information for the purposes of inquiry in the event of an accident. Nor let us forget, as Mrs McKenna said, that a large percentage of marine pollution is due to practices coyly described as ‘operational’, that is, tank cleaning and other deliberate spills, against which the arsenal of deterrents must be intensified. I know how much attention Mr Gayssot pays to the action of Equasis and now to Galileo, which we must implement. Vigorous action must be taken on the question of flags of convenience, including that of the Kerguelen Islands in the case of France, and against ships which fly the flag of states with above average detentions and delays during the 36 months preceding the adoption of these directives, which are blacklisted in the annual report of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding. Attention must also be paid to the complicated financial set-ups based on ‘brass-plate’ companies. My thanks go to Mr Watts for the specific proposals he has made in this connection. I thank the rapporteurs and I urge my fellow Members in the European Parliament to take these proposals into consideration. They seem to me such as to make significant progress possible, which is crucial for the effectiveness of the legislative resolutions we are going to be voting on, which must not remain dead letter terms throughout the territories and waters for which Europe is responsible. I have in mind not only the Atlantic and other oceans, but also the Mediterranean Sea, where disasters such as we have been experiencing could be irreversible.

 Mr President, we presented the MEDA report at the beginning of September, and while this report, admittedly, allowed us to note some shortcomings, it was also, more importantly, an opportunity to proclaim loud and clear the determination of both this House and the Commission in Euro-Mediterranean matters. Commissioner Patten, I read your article in today’s issue of Le Monde
. I concur completely with it. What Mr Moscovici has just said is precisely what you stated yourself. The fact, moreover, that we carried the motion in this House, with the enormous majority of 502 votes in favour and a paltry 17 against, shows that we are all unanimously in favour of renewing and boosting the Euro-Mediterranean Process. There are a number of points I would like to clarify, now that the Marseilles Conference is about to take place, in order to ensure that we get some answers, as it is not enough to repeat ritualistic phrases, given that we are all in agreement. We also need to take practical action and to get specific answers. Indeed, on Thursday evening, I assessed the situation with Mr Josselin, the French Minister responsible for these matters, and I know that the French Presidency is wholeheartedly behind the idea of promoting the process as we see it. I should like, first of all, to discuss the budget. Where do matters stand in this respect? We have been told that roughly EUR 8 billion have been earmarked for the period 2000-2006, but this amount seems to fluctuate. So what, in the end, is the budget for 2001? It seems that at least EUR 1 billion is needed annually, but for the moment this sum has not been allocated, and at the same time there is talk of EUR 200 million to be taken, supposedly, from the margin relating to appropriations for Kosovo and Serbia. It is far from clear. We do not need to create competition between all these various needs but to find new resources. I am in complete agreement with Commission Patten that, in order to do a proper practical job, the appropriations must be made available. I strenuously urge all my fellow Members to set aside the appropriations needed for us to be able to take action and to be able to consider the projects. Secondly, I should like to point out that we must give a boost to decentralised cooperation, which seems to be in a bad way. This is a major concern of local communities and non-governmental organisations. The forum that was held in Marseilles on 12 November made that quite clear. Next, we must increase the amount of appropriations for regional development in order to encourage relations and trade between regions, but also environmental protection, the fight against terrorism and drugs trafficking, emigration and integration, and to make progress towards human rights, as we have requested. We would ask what action the Commission intends to take in order to invite proposals for projects, with the involvement of civil society, and in order to process and monitor these projects. These are the important practical questions I wished to ask, and I should like to thank Mr Brok for allowing us to have this debate just before the Presidency and the Commission are due to discuss these issues.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I, too, would like to congratulate our colleague, Mrs Elisabeth Montfort, on the quality of her report on the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship for 2001-2005. She has studied the proposals with great care, and she has taken the trouble to consult with the many parties concerned. That approach has been an asset in defining and optimising the implementation of this programme. Here I want to stress some of the strengths we need to build on to improve Europe's contribution to business in the new ‘knowledge-based’ economy. How can we make a better contribution to Enterprise Europe, as President Prodi called it in a recent speech? First, every business must be included. Of course there are large businesses, involving several thousand people, say. We need to recognise not just what they contribute to the market economy, in terms of jobs and profit, but also their contribution to knowledge through their support for applied research and to the creation of hosts of businesses around them. Through their contacts with – often public – research laboratories they undoubtedly supplement public funding, which frequently needs supplementing, and enables discoveries to be made. So it is important to make sure our action here is positive. Turning now to SMIs/SMEs and micro-enterprises. As Mr Caudron said, these represent 98% of our economic fabric. Our greatest potential for adaptation resides in them. They are the true economic and innovation vanguard, in the front line and openly exposed to the risks inherent in this domain. We should take special care of them and make sure there are concrete measures which they can assimilate easily. Secondly, and without going through the measures set out in the report, which are, anyway, the result of an assessment made last year, you will note, all the same, that we are taking up the same old essential points: simplification of the assistance formalities, which are still too cumbersome, and even stifling for SMIs; help with finance and risk capital to ensure greater stability; aid for research into new technologies; establishment of a European standard through the BEST process; aid with communication and information. These businesses need buttressing within their geographic or technological environment. We must encourage them, promote local development using local resources, both material and human, and foster their relations with local communities. Here we should not only be helping businesses with a traditional structure, but also public-private partnerships and cooperatives which are increasingly contributing, among other things, to improving stability and creating jobs. Thirdly, we must look for European added value. This could involve, in particular, the installation of a European network, both physical and electronic, which every SMI can join, where they can find information, exchange knowledge through appropriate mechanisms with appropriate ethics, and benefit from the prime advantages the European Union decides to establish for their support. It seems clear to me that Brussels cannot run everything in this domain. We need operations in the field, regional delegations the Commission, Parliament or the Council can control, as the Majo report recognised just recently. Certain intervention issues must also be selected. They are easy to find: in the information society especially, in that sustainable development we hear so much about, in the fields of the environment, clean technologies, eco-technologies, new energy sources and new materials. The hallmark of this European aid network should be a number of centres, like the Euro Info Centres. For an SME/SMI, working with this European network would undoubtedly mean that, where synergies exists, it would not have to form a consortium with several other businesses in different Union countries, which often results in an artificial set-up with masses of paperwork and endless complications. I really hope the Commission will set up a working group on this topic, involving interested Members of Parliament. Fourthly, there are the proposals for the European research area we are beginning to construct. In parallel, we propose to introduce a European innovation area, and I am grateful to Mrs Montfort for having agreed to include that proposal in her report. We must take account of the results of and follow-up to the work of the Science and Governance Conference held last week in Brussels under the auspices of the Seville Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, because there is plenty of overlap with the subject we are dealing with today. Finally, I am sure it is time to create a proper parliamentary office for scientific and technological options assessment within the European Parliament, to assist in decisions and monitoring. These exist in the national parliaments and ours would match theirs. Our President, Mrs Fontaine, is asking us, because we are responsible for STOA, to send a message of support today to the EPTA, an organisation specialised in technological assessment in Europe, founded under the aegis of our colleague Mr Barón Crespo, which is meeting in Berlin on 10 November. But STOA is not really that kind of organisation and we have specific proposals to make on the subject. Mrs Montfort, our group will give your report its wholesale support.

 Mr President, what I have to say relates to Kosovo because it was the Commission communication on Kosovo that you were supposed to talk about today, which somehow got transformed into a communication on Serbia. I understand this, given that there is a new leader, President Kostunica, and that it is necessary to be involved in the process with him so that things can go ahead properly. Last week, I was in Pristina. I met a lot of people and, in particular, I met Bernard Kouchner for a working session. I also saw the enormous problems that exist there. You spoke about the Danube, but it is simply not enough to carry out studies. Urgent action must be taken because the Danube is being polluted by stockpiles of sulphuric acid and from sources in Mitrovica. There needs to be a risk control plan not only for this region, but also for the town of Pristina and for other towns in Kosovo. Whole populations live in destitution. Attacks with enriched uranium warheads have polluted the town of Pristina and the other areas that were hit. The destruction of the sports stadium released asbestos into the air, which spread throughout the town. There is a very serious health problem. I would therefore like to draw your attention to this and to tell you that there is a social problem. This aid must go on social concerns, the widows and orphans and so on. Urgent measures need to be taken. I must insist on this.

Mr Busquin, thank you very much for your Communication, which shows that you are being very swift in giving effect to the proposals for guidelines that you have set out with regard to the common research area. I would like to ask you whether you consider that it will be possible to launch, as early as 2001, pilot actions regarding the preparation of the Sixth Framework Programme, and, in particular, the networking of research that you have talked about. I would also like to ask you to award particular attention to the relations between the STOA Unit 
and matters that concern your Directorate for which you have responsibility, because problems exist in this regard. Many research-related matters selected by the STOA Unit are then poorly received by the Commission departments. This issue should therefore be discussed with you, particularly in connection with the Joint Research Centre (JRC). Lastly, I would like to ask you whether we could quite rapidly develop research activities within a Euro-Mediterranean context, since you recently had a meeting at Capri with the Research Ministers of countries from both sides of the Mediterranean, and because this is an issue of great concern to Parliament.

The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is satisfied that, at the suggestion of the rapporteur, who is a member of the group, tighter controls are going to be placed on the establishment of port reception facilities for ship-generated waste. In particular, it is important that a tax is imposed on each ship to cover at least 30% of the cost of these facilities. It is not a question of creating ‘ecological boats’ that are able to treat all their waste at sea, essentially by means of incineration. Such conduct, which cannot realistically be controlled, in fact enables antipollution legislation to be bypassed: allegedly incinerated hydrocarbons and domestic waste are discharged into the sea; there is no selectivity and this only adds to the greenhouse effect. These proposals are in line with the proposals of the next marine pollution control Directive, for which I shall be drawing up the report on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. Furthermore, they provide for the homogeneous behaviour of ships within European maritime space, and they go some way to establishing the necessary facilities in European ports and to financing these facilities. These provisions must be accompanied by rigorous control and the behaviour of ships must be monitored using the Equasis and Galileo systems, the speedy implementation of which the French Presidency has resolved to promote.

I am pleased that there has been a satisfactory outcome to the conciliation procedure with regard to the important report dealing with numerous technical issues on water policy, an outcome which we owe to the persistence, competence and motivation of our rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann. Over the next quarter-century, we will make more progress in this field in the protection, good management and renewal of this resource than in the discovery and exploitation of new deposits. I would like to make two points to emphasise the importance of integrated water management: - firstly, I would like studies to be carried out on the establishment of a federal “water and environment” management system in the various countries at European Union level, - second, we must ensure that the proposals of the directive are implemented and encourage them, not only at European Union level, but also in the aid that we give to third countries in the form of "water" projects, the impact of which lies in a hydrographic ecosystem affecting the countries of the European Union, but also those that are part of the MEDA agreements, for example, which must be taken account of in the MAP projects and even in others, like the Upper Nile basin or Switzerland.

 Mr President, MEDA represents the practical implementation, the instrument of our Euro-Mediterranean policy, as defined following the Barcelona Convention in November 1995, followed by a number of forums, particularly those in Malta, Naples and Stuttgart. We are now presenting the first progress report, or annual report for 1998, but which, in fact, summarises the initial implementation period, 1996-1999, and prepares the way for the implementation of the actions for the second period, 2000-2006, in the form of the regulation proposed by our fellow Member, Mr Valdivielso de Cué. Given that this report is subject to the Hughes Procedure, we have included all the proposals adopted unanimously not only by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which was chiefly responsible, but also those of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. The context is this: approximately EUR 4 billion over the last four years, plus the considerable appropriations contributed by the EIB, have been allocated. The Barcelona Agreement signed by 27 countries, those of the European Union plus the 12 countries of the southern Mediterranean: Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey. The three main objectives involve the political and security dimension, the economic and financial dimension and the social, cultural and human dimension. The following observations have been made: this is a programme still in its infancy which has experienced implementation problems and has suffered from various administrative problems, as highlighted by the European Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control. There has been particular criticism of sub-contracting associations such as RTM. In the final analysis, implementation has been virtually paralysed and, despite the almost 100% commitment of appropriations, only 26 % have been paid to date, and that only with difficulty, with payment taking, on average, four years. We presented the ins and outs of the matter in sufficient detail in our report, so I am now able simply to summarise our conclusions, which are as follows: firstly, there is a need to simplify the regulation in order to enable the process to be speeded up, while ensuring greater transparency by providing the resources necessary for the Commission to plan the programme and for the Council to monitor it. Above all, the European Parliament must take part in the process and must be kept informed more regularly, particularly through the Euro-Mediterranean forum. It would be appropriate to speed up the signing of the association agreements, which to date have been signed only with 7 countries. This particularly concerns Lebanon, Algeria, Syria, etc. Secondly, project selection must be more democratic and must, to a greater extent, involve greater participation by civil society and NGOs, who continually expressed this desire, especially at the European Parliament round table held in Brussels on 29 June this year, entitled ‘Towards a sustainable MEDA’. Thirdly, respect for human rights must be monitored more carefully, for cooperation is not only targeted at economic progress, but is fundamentally related to democracy, freedom, peace, the eradication of inequality, and sustainable development. We would therefore ask that a report on the human rights record of each of the signatory or candidate countries be presented to Parliament annually to be taken into consideration in the selection of projects. Fourthly, we consider that the 10% of appropriations allotted to regional cooperation are inadequate as compared with the 90% allocated to bilateral cooperation. We must therefore comment on the volume of appropriations dedicated to regional schemes which, we acknowledge, are harder to negotiate and implement but which correspond to the objective of efficiency, particularly in improving South-South relations and, above all, in safeguarding more extensive action for decentralised cooperation, which we all consider to be an important goal. Fifthly, on the subject of the six priority areas of partnership, the environment, water policy, industry, energy, transport and the information society, we think it essential to reactivate programmes disregarded until now, the SMAP adopted in Helsinki in 1997 on the environment. At least EUR 10 million must be allocated annually for water. Action must be undertaken to promote renewable energies and to provide support for SMEs and for transport. We should support each country’s sustainable development plans. We therefore consider it absolutely essential to implement the proposals for regulations suggested by Mr Valdivielso de Cué, particularly those on simplifying procedures in order to increase the transparency, efficiency and speed of payments and on deploying more Commission staff in order to ensure better administration of the programme, which must cease to be a poor relation in comparison with the cooperation programmes for Asian or ACP countries. At this point I should like to thank not only the many participants, particularly the countries concerned and the NGOs that helped me to finalise this report, but also our European Commissioner, Mr Patten, who has a clear overview of the situation and whose external relations departments should contribute towards improving Mediterranean projects from now on. Thanks, too, to Mr Patten’s colleagues, especially Mr Patrick Laurent. I should also like to stress the interest which Commissioner Busquin has taken in our work, reactivating Mediterranean cooperation in the field of research, particularly at the forthcoming informal summit on Capri, on 29 September. Thanks are also due to all our fellow Members of Parliament, particularly Mrs Terrón, Mrs McNally and Mr Sami Naïr who are working on this issue. It is crucial to implement our proposals in order to achieve the necessary revitalisation of the Euro-Mediterranean process. Above all, the appropriations for 2000-2006 should not be penalised because of the programme’s earlier problems. Instead the programme must be the spearhead of our policy, which we shall be discussing again at the Marseilles Conference in November. We wish the French Presidency every success. I know that they are extremely concerned to resolve all difficulties and determined to achieve their objectives. (Applause)

 Madam President, first of all I should like to thank my fellow Member, Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, for his efforts, particularly with regard to consultation: he took a good number of our proposals and amendments into consideration. The JRC’s nuclear activities present us, however, with a twofold problem: that of reducing this type of activity, on the agenda now more than at the time the JRC was set up under the aegis of Euratom, and the problem of the historical liabilities from nuclear activities involving the matter of decommissioning, at an estimated cost of more than EUR 500 million, all told, though there is every possibility that this gross figure has been underestimated, as is generally the case in nuclear matters. Moreover, although four JRC sites are concerned (Ispra, Karlsruhe, Vienna and Petten), there are still six of the fifteen Member States (Ireland, Luxembourg, Denmark, Greece, Portugal and Austria) that do not benefit from this research. This whole business has a past history, a historical context which, as the very title of the report indicates, merits serious analysis, both of the origin of the research and of the transfers effected from various countries to the JRC. This is why, in the first place, we are not in favour of dealing with the problem of cost as a side issue. Using appropriations that have not been used may prove an incentive not to use all research appropriations in order to be able to invest them in decommissioning. Secondly, a serious reassessment must be made of the research appropriations and the cost of research in relation to decommissioning and of the consequent impact on the cost of nuclear energy, which must also be re-evaluated. Thirdly, we are therefore in favour of Kathalijne Buitenweg’s proposal to set up a specific budget line and to determine this by a trialogue. We should like, however, to draw the Commission’s attention to the fact that problems exist not only in terms of the budget, but there are also technical problems, and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has useful points to make in this trialogue. Decommissioning operations are not compatible with the principle of annual budget payments and all the countries have appropriate internal procedures. The objective of the trialogue is therefore to reach an agreement between the three institutions on an appropriate regulation which will serve as a legal basis for financing the operations. Only on this condition, which must lead us to make proposals for the 2001 budget, will we accept the interim measures for the current budget.

 Mr President, it is, of course, essential to develop a European research area, but this must not operate simply in areas neglected by the Member States. It must be built openly, sharing competences and resources at as early a stage as possible, in order to ensure optimum synergy. I wish to thank Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel for her very dynamic work on this report. We must naturally consider the economic impact and job creation, as our fellow Member, Mr Desama, said. In the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we do not give priority to the pursuit of competition and competitiveness at any price, or to the commercialisation of research. Both fundamental and applied research must, above all, retain public support and a public dimension. We are opposed to the areas of biotechnology focused on genetic manipulation or patenting the living organism. On the other hand, we are in favour of research focusing on sustainable technologies, particularly in the areas of the environment and health. As the Committee of the Regions advocated in Mrs Blandin’s report, we wish to emphasise support for decentralised research, the formation of networks, collaboration with the regions. For example, the cooperation which has developed through the ecosites, in the field of ecotechnologies, according to the criteria of sustainable development, is appropriate to local development and to supporting SMBs and SMIs. Europe may be a significant driving force in this field. I should also like to stress the aid which we wish to provide for new information and communications technologies by developing virtual laboratories for data collection, analysis and diagnosis, and prevention in the area of major risks. There is here a potential which can only be realised fully at European level, in collaboration with universities, centres of excellence and the authorities. Finally, I should like to flag the interest we have in the Joint Research Centre, a subject that is well worth thinking carefully about. Its nuclear bias, which was topical when it was set up because of the involvement of Euratom, must now be reconsidered. It is not a matter of duplicating the installations or the research carried out in some European Union Member States but instead of developing, as Mrs McNally suggests, a shared system of technical and scientific references for political applications. In this respect, there is also a need for serious thinking about the STOA. In conclusion, I wish to thank our Commissioner, Mr Philippe Busquin, for undertaking, as soon as he arrived, this investigation into a European research area which we support. He did not neglect the areas of schemes on behalf of young people and the participation of women in research and, in continuing liaison with the Member States and with Parliament, he is working towards developing a knowledge-based Europe in the latest fields, without neglecting social and human aspects.

 Mr President, the basic economic instrument for the implementation of our Mediterranean policy, resulting from the Barcelona Process, is undoubtedly the MEDA programme, on whose activities it is my task to report, and for which my fellow Member, Mr Valdivielso de Cué and I are currently involved in amending the regulations. Let me draw the attention of our fellow Members to these reports which are currently being discussed in committee and which are to be presented before the House in June. At this juncture, I should like to highlight two important points: firstly, MEDA is a good programme, a young programme, which has to date suffered from inefficiencies in its implementation. Less than 30% of the total appropriation in the order of EUR 3 500 million for the last four years has been paid to date, what with delays in payment, observations from the Court of Auditors on the examination of the files and excessive time periods. The regulation must be amended and Commission staff must be increased. We shall have proposals to present to Parliament to this effect in order to ensure better examination of the files. Next, 90% of the appropriations are reserved for bilateral cooperation, but only 10% for regional cooperation, which is of great interest to us. This must be increased, decentralised cooperation must be stimulated and the participation of civilian societies must be utilised. Secondly, this programme does not focus solely on economic matters and free trade. There is also the definition of a common area of peace and stability, and the concern for rapprochement of peoples by means of a social and cultural partnership. Finally, it plans to bring third countries up to par in terms of respect for human rights and, in this regard, in many countries the situation is showing no signs of improvement. We therefore request that the Council and the Commission publish a report annually, or every two years, on human rights in the countries participating in the Barcelona Process, which could be used as a basis for the implementation of cooperative operations between the European Union and third countries. Tunisia, which Daniel Cohn-Bendit has just mentioned, has alone received 10% of the MEDA appropriations, almost all of which have been paid. This is something that we must take into account specifically in order to ensure that it is the European Union which is actively directing the projects and that the projects are not just decided according to …  (The President cut the speaker off

 Mr President, our sympathy and our solidarity go out to those people and regions stricken by the disaster, but good intentions are not enough, there must be compensation for the damage and losses covering both the restoration of the environment and the shellfish farms and fishing equipment. We are pleased to hear the Commissioner announce the urgent need to act and to offer compensation, and for this to be backdated. We also deplore the excessively lax application of vessel inspection, and we are in favour of creating a European coast guard authority, and also, in particular, of introducing more binding regulations and making double hulls mandatory. We further deplore the system of flags of convenience with regard to both merchant vessels and fishing boats. Finally, we were shocked to learn that the cargo was extremely carcinogenic, with a polyaromatic hydrocarbon content of more than 1 000 parts per million. This means that the 15 000 tonnes of cargo released into the sea include 15 tonnes of highly toxic products. This is not acceptable. We only found out too late and, as a result, medical inspection must be provided, paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment. Finally, we think it absolutely essential to pay particular attention to preventing such risks, as well as to scientific research work in order to avoid and eliminate damage. A great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation. Solutions cannot be found at the last minute, when the disaster is already in progress. Consequently, the bulk of the action must be taken beforehand.

 Mr President, I do not agree with this chorus of satisfaction expressed by my colleagues, who are delighted about the relaxing of a directive that respects the principle of precaution and which takes measures to protect consumers’ health. This infectious salmon disease is caused by an orthomixomicrovirus which breaks down the blood of salmon, causing death. It spreads very easily through mucus in saline water, etc. Under the 1993 directive, not only the diseased fish can be culled but also the farmed fish where individuals are affected, exactly like the case when one cow is sick in a herd and the whole herd is culled according to the principle of precaution. What we currently propose is to relax this directive, so that we do not cull all the fish, but only the fish that are found to be diseased. For the others, well, we would have time to see what would happen, according to local circumstances. I think it is a very serious matter that we act in this way. I would particularly draw my colleagues’ attention to this fact as we cannot make do with saying that a temperature of 27° has every advantage for the human race and that, consequently, there is no risk to men. What about women? Nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard. There is also a risk to the environment, because we know that there is an incubation period in salmon and that, consequently, if they are eaten, they can be carriers of this virus and present a risk. There is another risk to the environment as well, because this disease is transmitted to wild fish, as we have seen. For this reason, together with my colleague, Patricia McKenna, we have tabled amendments against the proposals made by the Commission.

Mr President, I very much appreciate this report by Mr Katiforis on fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment. Let us not forget that fish are at the very basis of our food chain and that the first ‘environmental’ disaster, Minamata disease, occurred in 1958 in Japan owing to the fact that fish were polluted by mercury. We should therefore very carefully monitor pollution from industrial activity, but also from domestic activity. I do not believe that ejecting emissions at sea, and particularly in a closed environment like the Mediterranean, when we want to clean up purification plants, is a good way to clean up water. We should pay particular attention to telluric pollution, to development, to the urbanisation of coastal areas, etc. But we should also think about restoring the environment and, for example, solving the problems associated with caulerpa taxifolia
, and the areas of posidonia that are disappearing and which must therefore be protected. They say that if you want something done, it is best to do it yourself and so the users of the sea, the fishermen, must be very attentive. It will certainly be necessary to reduce the amount of fish caught and the elimination of the surplus capacity between 30 and 40%, as proposed by the Commission, has been very greatly watered down by the Council, to between 5 and 10%. It will also be necessary to undertake selective fishing and, together with my colleague, Nol Mamre, who is also a former Member of the European Parliament, we would request a moratorium on the use of deep-sea trawlers in Community waters in the Bay of Biscay, to the south of the 47th parallel north, because we have had enough of seeing dolphins being washed up and dying on our beaches, particularly at the moment. So we must practise selective fishing. Aquaculture should also be monitored. Read Mr Katiforis’s report again, in which he says that in Scotland, for example, 17 000 salmon are infected by the disease that I just mentioned, and impact upon the environment. Let us therefore take great care with work in a closed environment. The Council of Europe is coming before the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 22 March to speak about the research work that must be undertaken, particularly in the marine environment and, more precisely, the scientific and economic challenges of exploiting the oceans. Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to come and take part in this discussion.

 Mr President, I want to speak along similar lines to Mrs De Veyrac. The catastrophic floods which have occurred in the south of France have levied a very heavy toll with 39 deaths and widespread chaos in the region. In the four départements
 affected by the floods of 12 and 13 November, namely Aude, Hérault, Pyrénées-Orientales and Tarn, the bill will be in excess of EUR 0.7 billion and compensation to individuals will amount to EUR 0.5 billion. The damage to public services is estimated at over FRF 1 billion because of the extensive damage to roads and railways, power and telephone lines, buildings and public facilities. All sectors have been affected, with over 200 craftsmen having been caught in the disaster, 260 businesses having suffered serious damage and 1,518 employees having been affected. I would draw Parliament’s attention to the fact that this is indeed a natural disaster for these floods and this rain were twenty times greater than normal. This is not therefore the result, as we would sometimes like to believe, of carelessness in local development. This is truly a natural disaster. This is why I would urge Parliament to act in this region.

We are grateful to Mr Valdivielso de Cué for the work carried out in this report. However, we decided to table a number of amendments, some of which were accepted by the Commission. At this point I should like to stress the points which we would like to have accepted but which have not been incorporated for the moment. First, we agree fully with Amendment No 51, tabled by Mr Krehl on behalf of the Liberals which, in view of the war which the Russians are waging on Chechnya, seeks to grant aid only for democracy and social development.  Secondly, insofar as we are allocating appropriations for the restoration of nuclear power stations, we would like them to be conditional upon the closure or replacement of these power stations, as we do not wish their lifetime to be extended. Consequently, we have tabled Amendment No 48, the wording of which, as set out here, has been accepted by the Liberals.  Thirdly, we wish to support integrated projects with environmental implications which are on a more modest scale than national projects and which retain a local or regional dimension, so that the appropriations granted can be better controlled.  Finally, we consider that earmarking 25% of appropriations for investment is excessive and we would like to see this capped at 2% for investments in pilot projects, with a larger percentage going to projects of an experimental nature. We trust that you will give these proposals your due consideration.

Madam President, I am delighted to be making my maiden speech today in this House, as I am a new Member of Parliament, and I am happy to do so with regard to fisheries and the excellent report by Mrs Fraga Estévez, because I am the mayor of Mèze, in the French department of Hérault, in the south of France, which is a small town, one of the main Mediterranean coastal fishing ports, near Sète, which is the principal fishing port. I should tell you that since yesterday and again today, all the fishing ports along the Mediterranean coast have been on strike because the fishermen are protesting against the price of diesel oil and the collapse in the prices of bluefish, tuna, sardines and also eels that are not sold any more. A real market problem exists and it is the whole of this profession that is being ruined. And they are protesting against the European directives that they find too restrictive. In the context of discussions like these, we need to show our support for the fishing trade. I will raise three points with regard to Mrs Fraga Estévez’s excellent report: firstly, traceability. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is in favour of detailed labelling on the products, from first sale to the last, so that people know where the product has been caught, how and also whether it is a product of fishing or aquaculture. We wish to go even further than the proposals made by the Commission. Secondly, on the questions relating to withdrawal and destruction, a reference price, a guide price, is fixed and subsidies are granted when the fishery products are not sold. Subsidies are also granted to conserve and store products. Our group is in favour of this when it is a matter of conserving products and not wasting them, but if it is a matter of increasing the amount of fishing undertaken only to then destroy the fish, we are not in favour. We believe that the producers’ organisations should be made aware so that the fisheries plan is well established throughout the year and so that intensive fishing is not favoured only to subsequently destroy the fish. It is very important and perhaps requires an increase in the reference price and, in the end, a whole procedure, but we should like the resource to be well managed. Finally, I will conclude by saying that as far as the customs duties are concerned, we are not in favour of these duties being systematically abolished. An impact study should be undertaken, as Mrs Fraga Estévez proposes, and objective criteria should be established before deciding which customs duties will be abolished. Our group supports Mrs Fraga Estévez’s report and Mr Gallagher’s report.
