 Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I first of all commend our rapporteurs’ work on this telecom package, which is to be put to the vote tomorrow, because it is a good text. It takes into account all the aspects of this revolution in communications that we are living through: telecommunications networks, regulation, economic aspects, consumer rights and access to the Internet. However, on this last point, I have to say that the Democratic Movement’s delegation was disappointed. The compromise reached last week on Mrs Trautmann’s report on this particular issue is unsatisfactory. The weakness of this draft lies in the failure to take into account the case law relating to Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights. This draft in fact only legitimises the French Government’s attempts to impose its concept of a high administrative authority, the infamous ‘Hadopi’ law. There are people who are afraid of the Internet, people who do not understand its development or its interest. These people often say that the Internet is a lawless area. It is precisely in order to prevent the Internet from becoming a lawless area that the Democratic Movement’s delegation considers that terminating Internet access should not be an administrative decision but a judicial decision. The Internet is a wonderful tool for exercising one’s fundamental rights. Some people believe that administrative management is the solution. That tells us how much importance they attach to fundamental rights. The rules that ensure freedom of communication between people are timeless and do not depend on one medium or another. The right to a judicial process must not be called into question on any pretext.

 Madam President, what are they trying to make us swallow? A mixture of red and white wine in the guise of rosé? Our citizens are reacting very negatively to this Commission initiative, which has the agreement of the Member States, including France. I have noticed two types of reaction: firstly, our citizens are wondering why the European Union is meddling with rosé, when there are so many other issues to worry about, particularly the serious issue of the economic crisis. Secondly, producers of traditional rosé wines, which are produced by rapid maceration and delicate pressing, see this as a serious attack against the ‘rosé’ designation and against the image of quality, developed over so many years, of wines such as these rosés from Provence, which still retain the aroma of the land and which have ensured the success of rosé wines in general. During the last meeting of the ‘wine’ intergroup, we finally understood the motivation of the European Commission and Member States. Consumption of rosé table wines is increasing throughout the world and accounts for nearly 30% of wine consumption. Third countries are producing blends. The European Union market is starting to be targeted by these third-country blends. The UK market is particularly dominated by wines from the United States. It is well-known that traditional rosé has a short shelf life. It is so much easier to produce rosé wine on demand by using stocks of red and white wines. For the Member States, it is therefore a question of adapting the production of rosé table wines to the international market. Unless other oenological practices for making rosé wine can be discovered, we might for example be inspired by Pierre Dac, who said: ‘Graft roses onto vines to get natural rosé wine!’ This cannot be. Like many of my fellow Members, I think that the European Commission and the Member States must go back to the drawing board, work on the ‘rosé wine’ designation, and ensure that the name ‘rosé’ is exclusively reserved for wines produced using traditional methods, whether in the European Union or in third countries. In the meantime, Commissioner, I invite you to discover one of these little rosés from Gaillac, with a thousand colours of the Tarn, to be enjoyed responsibly, of course.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the plenary session of January 2009, we adopted two legislative texts on the sustainable use of pesticides and on the procedures for marketing plant protection products. The negotiation of these texts has been passionate and has allowed real advances in the protection of human health and the environment. Those two texts would be nothing without this one, however. This regulation is, in fact, the enforcer for the other two. You will recall, Commissioner, that these statistics are needed to reveal how many new products are coming on to the market, and also how their use is growing, and above all to calculate the risk indicators defined in the report on the sustainable use of pesticides. I would also stress that, in my view, we have not only struck a balance between the necessary transmission of data and the confidentiality of the latter, but also established proportionate administrative requirements, since this is a concern for the users. As regards biocides, it is important to stress that this text should, in time, cover them in accordance with the results of an impact study. We have studied the non-agricultural commercial uses of pesticides. For the moment, any assessment of their volume can only be intuitive. For this reason, the pilot studies due to be carried out by the European Commission will be very enlightening. I wish finally to thank our rapporteur, who supported us throughout the negotiations and made a major contribution to our reaching an agreement.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in September 2007 the European Commission presented its third energy package in relation to the operation of the internal market. Very quickly, the debates began to focus on the important, though not exclusive, issue of separating the activities of producing and transporting energy. The issue of network ownership, which in my view was insufficiently dealt with at first reading, seems to have been taken more seriously. The coexistence of different options, including the infamous third way, now enhanced and clarified, strikes me as being a good thing – which is an obvious statement given that I was co-author of this amendment. Fortunately, however, summing this third package up as ownership unbundling would be a mistake. The progress made is real: more rights for consumers, more powers for regulators, more cooperation among regulators, 10-year investment plans, more transparency to facilitate the development of renewables, more technical cooperation among network operators, and also tools for better consumption, such as smart meters. This is a further step towards European solidarity. The ‘third-country’ clause, despite appearing less sensational than that initially drafted by the Commission, does explicitly state that a Member State has the right to refuse to certify an operator if certifying it would jeopardise the security of its energy supply or that of another Member State. I do perhaps have one regret concerning the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators: our wish would have been to create a strong, independent agency that is capable of taking decisions without the support of our body. We came up against the infamous Meroni judgment. Let us not delude ourselves: the construction of a true European energy policy will require yet more advances, and institutional ones in particular. The security of supply, the fight against climate change, the regulation of markets: all of these objectives should be pursued with a pragmatic, not dogmatic, approach. What European citizens expect is not the application of economic theories, but concrete evidence that the opening up of markets will benefit them, by giving them the freedom to choose their suppliers, and reasonable, stable and predictable prices. I am grateful to my fellow Members, to our commissioner and to the Council for this constructive effort.

Mr President, my group fully supports the aim of this directive, which is to establish a Community framework to ensure and maintain the continuous improvement of safety in nuclear installations within the European Union. Our Parliament has always stressed the urgent need to implement clear and rigorous legislation and to adopt practical measures at Community level in areas relating to nuclear safety, radioactive waste management and the decommissioning of nuclear installations. Our debates have raised the issue, among others, of training and knowledge. It is vital for Europe, which has nuclear expertise, to preserve this knowledge, not least by ensuring that safety inspectors within nuclear installations are trained and qualified. Finally, I am satisfied that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has accepted an amendment to the legislative resolution calling on the European Commission to consult the group of experts, in accordance with Article 31 of the Treaty. I repeat: we demand transparency, and we want clear and rigorous legislation. I am grateful to our rapporteur, Mr Hökmark.

Madam President, as my fellow Members have reminded us, this storm has exacted a heavy toll. There are victims in France and Spain and this evening we think of them and their families. 200 000 hectares of forest have been destroyed in the south west of France. In fact, this storm has ravaged 60% of the Landes forest. 1.7 million homes were without electricity at the height of the storm, and 3 200 of them in the Landes are still without electricity. Thousands had their phone lines cut and also their water supply disrupted. Many roads are still impassable due to obstacles such as fallen trees, power lines, floods or landslips. The services are endeavouring to restore everything as quickly as possible. While I am pleased that the French Government has formally committed itself to submitting an application so that the areas of France affected can benefit from this fund, I deplore the fact that the French Presidency did not deem it necessary to press for a review of this fund. This fund, as you, Commissioner, and my fellow Members have said, is still blocked by the Council of Ministers. As far as Parliament is concerned, it is about covering any major natural disaster which causes serious harm to the population and the environment, like floods, fires and droughts. However, we are going further by also including man-made phenomena, like catastrophes caused by terrorist attacks. Our Parliament has also declared itself in favour of lowering the threshold for assistance. Now, if we question whether this Solidarity Fund is working for the affected regions, we can see that we risk being below the damage threshold. Now, this is a situation where, ultimately, several countries are affected. Therefore, I think that this threshold should also be reviewed to show that European solidarity really can exist. As you have said, Commissioner, and my fellow Members have underlined, this sort of event will be repeated due to the results of climate change. The Commission has already announced a Communication on adapting to climate change. It is important from now on for this Solidarity Fund to be a genuine European instrument for protecting citizens. It is time Europe showed that, in tragic situations, it is there to protect its citizens.

Madam President, nine days ago the regions of Aquitaine, Midi-Pyrénées and Languedoc-Roussillon were hit hard by Storm Klaus. The damage is extensive, and I call for these regions to receive emergency European aid. I have in mind, in particular, the European Union’s Solidarity Fund, but also the Structural Funds and the Rural Development Fund, and I am also thinking about the authorisation of state aid. I should like to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to the fact that, in May 2005, the European Parliament adopted the report by Mr Berend on the reform of the Solidarity Fund, in order to extend its scope. The matter is currently at a standstill within the Council of Ministers. It is imperative that there be a positive outcome to it soon. European citizens expect the European Union to protect them and to offer them practical assistance. Allowing these French regions to receive emergency aid, but also seeing through the reform of the Solidarity Fund, would represent, in the eyes of Europeans, cast-iron guarantees that the European Union’s duty and purpose is to be at their side in difficult situations.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our debates on this Second Strategic Energy Review have of course been marked by this new gas-supply crisis between Russia and Ukraine. This crisis has brought to light shortcomings, the fragility of the interconnections and the European Union’s difficulty in reacting and in speaking with one voice. It has revealed, for the third time, the need for a common energy policy. However, I must say – and our Commissioner has just pointed this out – that we are now seeing progress and more cooperation and solidarity among Member States, and thus hopes of a solution with which to manage these crises. I should like to thank the Members who have done a great deal to enrich this report, which we drafted quickly, since we were informed of the communication in November. I am not going to explain in detail everything that we set out in this resolution, but I shall perhaps instead point out what messages the Committee on Industry, Research and Industry wished to put across with it. The context is as follows: the climate constraint is going to get tougher, the European Union’s security of supply is being threatened by ever more serious and frequent crises, and its competitiveness may be harmed. This implies the need to think differently about energy consumption and use within the European Union, to think differently about our energy resources, and to allow ourselves to exploit this considerable source of jobs that exists in the energy sector, jobs that are so crucial in the context of the economic crisis that we are going through. What are we proposing? There is the short term: promoting the 3x20 by 2020 vision of the energy and climate change package so as to turn it into European energy policy. This is a joint action at several levels – global, European, national and local – which means that the main priorities that we have indicated are of course energy saving, energy efficiency and the development of renewable energies, since the European Union’s potential in this area is great. In particular, the objective of 20% energy efficiency will have to be made binding. Secondly, the European Union’s security of supply will have to be improved through investment in the networks and, in particular, in the interconnections. Solidarity among the Member States means that the networks must supply regions that are isolated and highly dependent on a single supplier. This also means that the Directive on the security of the gas supply will have to be revised in order to make it a European crisis management tool. Improving the security of supply also means strengthening and structuring the dialogue with transit countries and producer countries. These energy interdependence relations need to be developed, particularly those with Russia and the Mediterranean area. Thirdly, having an internal market is a crucial factor in terms of the security of supply. How, though, can a Member State be supplied via another Member State if the interconnections are weak or non-existent? Fourthly, we need to identify the best practices at international level. In this regard, let us strengthen our exchanges of information with Japan and the United States – California, in particular – but let us not delude ourselves: our relations with these energy-consuming countries are founded on both cooperation and competition, especially in terms of energy technologies. Then there is the long term, which is very important. The task is to predict the future of the European Union’s energy supply. We should be able by, say, 2010-2020, to write road maps on a scenario basis for the European Union’s supply in 2050. To do this, ambitious objectives must be set with regard to the fight against climate change. Our committee is proposing a reduction of 60-80%, but perhaps in future of at least 80%, in CO2
 emissions, a 35% increase in energy efficiency and a 60% share of renewable energies, to be achieved by 2050. Our Parliament is calling for this road map to envisage developing the share of the different energy sources so that investments can be planned in means of production, interconnections, and research and development. In the energy mix for 2050 the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has confirmed the share of nuclear energy alongside the other energy sources, such as renewable energies, as well as the desire to develop means of energy storage and to use solar energy, which is an infinite resource.
 Anne Laperrouze,  
rapporteur. − (FR) 
Mr President, Mrs Reding, Mr Piebalgs, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your exceptionally valuable contributions; they show how vast this energy field is and that energy really is a basic need. In our debate and in the report, which moreover reflect the discussions that we have had among ourselves in the various political groups, I have noted a broad consensus on the need to strengthen the networks and the interconnections, to use information and communication technologies to make the networks intelligent – as Mrs Reding just explained – to strengthen relations with producer countries and transit countries – that was in particular the aim of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, with our rapporteur, Mr Dimitrakopoulos – and also to reach an agreement on energy efficiency, energy savings, and the development of renewable energies. In conclusion, improving energy efficiency, developing renewable energies, diversifying our sources and lines of supply, consolidating the dialogue with producer countries, but also ensuring that the 27 Member States speak with one voice and, above all, that we effect a change in our lives is the consensus that we have achieved. All these dimensions are vital ways to guarantee this common energy security that we all want. The differences of course relate to the composition of the energy mix. What are the energy sources? I should like to respond to my fellow Members from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and then also to other Members who have spoken out against nuclear energy. I wish to say that we do need to be careful. There has been a great deal of exaggeration in what has been said. I believe that we have set some very ambitious targets for 2050. Mention has been made of an 80% reduction in CO2
 emissions and of a 60% share of renewable energies. It is quite clear that a large share has been allocated to all renewable energy sources. In terms of nuclear energy, it is acknowledged in this report that it is part of the energy mix. In this regard, I should like to conclude by simply reminding you of the objectives: a CO2 
concentration of 450 ppm, which has been set in order to guarantee this limit of a 2°C rise. I should like to remind you that, in these efforts that have been announced, we are talking about a 9% share of nuclear energy, 54% energy efficiency, 35% renewables and 14% geological carbon capture and storage. All that is for 2030. Thus, nuclear energy is part of the mix, and coal too. I for my part am not a fan of coal, I am not a fan of nuclear, but we need to have the broadest possible range of energy sources. I would not like to have to choose between coal and nuclear for 2050.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we find ourselves, I hope, on the verge of adopting this pesticide package. The two compromise texts that will be put to the vote in this House seem to me to be balanced and worthy of our support, and this for several reasons. The advances for producers and users are significant: the simplification of the authorisation procedures through, among other things, a division into three zones and the mutual recognition that goes with it. I should have liked to have had only one zone, to guarantee even more consistency on EU territory, but the Member States proved to be a little overcautious. Increased training requirements for sellers and users alike – teaching them how to understand and handle pesticides better – are guarantees not only of better health protection but also of economic gains. The advances for those who protect animals are also significant, not least through the pooling of data derived from animal testing. The advances for health and environmental protection are very significant; in the long term, the most dangerous substances will be replaced by less harmful ones. I must address the very controversial issue of endocrine disrupters. Until now there has been no definition of these. No legislative text dealt with this question. The compromise gives the European Commission four years in which to draft science-based proposals for measures intended to define endocrine disrupting properties. This scientific definition will enable products to be classified according to their disruptive or non-disruptive effects and, in fact, will provide the industry with the scientific legal framework that it requires. The compromise text also takes account of the issue of bees and of their crucial role in the ecosystem. I believe, in fact, that the wording found in the compromise, combined with the European Commission’s declaration, represents a major step forward. The effects of active substances not only on the overall development of bees, but also on nectar and pollen, will be taken into account. I should like to reassure certain stakeholders who have cast doubt on the availability of active substances and products. This compromise takes account of their fears. The three-zone system guarantees Member States the possibility of authorising a larger number of products. There is also the possibility of derogations. As far as minor uses are concerned, Parliament has fought to have the Commission draft proposals in the short term to establish a European fund. There is also the review clause, which calls on the European Commission to analyse the impact of this legislation on the diversification and the competitiveness of agriculture. Last but not least – and this has been pointed out by my fellow Members – we are encouraging pesticide manufacturers to develop new and effective products that respect human health and environmental protection. To conclude, I should like to point out that plant protection products are medicines for plants and thus should be used only in a controlled and judicious manner. These texts recognise and are going to further accentuate the importance of integrated production when it comes to sound and sustainable agriculture. The two texts that we have arrived at manage to strike a balance between health and environmental protection and the availability of products for farmers. I should like to conclude by saying what a pleasure it has been working with you, ladies and gentlemen, on this very sensitive matter. Our work has, I believe, been an exercise in listening, mutual understanding and cooperation. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and well done in particular to our two rapporteurs, Mrs Klass and Mrs Breyer, who were excellent negotiators in the search for a compromise with the Council.

Mr President, as much as I support the idea that the European Union should encourage the development of demonstration plants for CO2
 capture and storage, I also have doubts about the development of these technologies on a large scale to combat climate change. I am particularly concerned about the significant development of coal-fired electric plants on the pretext that, in the long term, we will know how to capture and store CO2
. We must, in my opinion, remain very cautious. My concern is increased by my disappointing assessment of the energy and climate package. We have confirmed the ambitious targets in order to show the whole world that Europe has engaged in an ambitious process of combating climate change. However, when we examine the content, in other words the tools that will enable us to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, I have the feeling that it will not be possible to achieve the targets in 2020 due, for example, to the climb-down on vehicle emissions and derogations for energy producers in particular. What is left for achieving the targets in 2020? Carbon storage, the development of new clean technologies? Too soon. Fortunately, what remains is the involvement of European businesses and citizens, who are certainly more prepared than the politicians who are governing them to commit to saving energy, using green energy and converting to new modes of transport. We still need to give them the means to do so.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems that we are all in agreement here on the fact that space policy has become an essential component of the future of our society. We could sum up three important strands to this: security and defence, protection against environmental crises and the supply of new services to human activities. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we must, as Europeans, recognise that space is taking on a strategic defensive dimension. I know that some of my fellow Members dispute this. Yes, the observation of the planet must be assured in the long term so as to study its slow, dynamic variations and, in particular, those caused by the actions of man that affect the global climate, natural resources and biodiversity. At the same time, a large number of public policy groups and economic activities need information and forecasts from observation systems based in space. This, in particular, is the importance of Europe’s GMES in the world GEO process. Yes, space policies are having a growing impact on scientific research, technological innovation and, beyond that, on the stimulation of imaginations. In this respect, space and planetary exploration programmes have an essential role to play from now on. Telephony and television, GPS, but also weather forecasting or even long-distance medical care have dramatically changed our way of life. We can no longer imagine what would happen if satellites stopped working. The experience acquired in space technologies – notably through the success of the Ariane rocket – in itself justifies implementing a real European space policy. To respond to our ambition of independence, it will be necessary to achieve not only good governance, but also, of course, good funding. In conclusion, the space policy that Europe pursues will demonstrate its willingness, either to remain an influential actor on the world scene, but one that is more or less reduced to a partner role, or to be a strong Europe, a major player in world governance capable of resolving the key problems facing the future of humanity.

Mr President, at the beginning of the 2000s we set the financial framework of the common agricultural policy (CAP) until 2013. Farmers have made investments based on those figures. Now, will we decide, half-way through the campaign, to reduce the payments that they are entitled to expect? This is unfair. I am against modulation as recommended by the European Commission or the Capoulas Santos report. The CAP is intended to support and give structure to agriculture. By way of example, we are seeing a general slump in livestock farming in favour of imports of sheep from third countries. Livestock farmers need a CAP that supports them. Ewe premiums are required, then, as well as environmental bonuses for keeping pastures and national reserves to deal with the ravages caused by outbreaks of disease, particularly bluetongue disease. Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, farmers are counting on us!

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the lively debates that we have had recently about energy show that energy is a valuable asset, a basic need. Well, what about water? This is even more precious. We are conscious of the scarcity of water in developing countries. Well, what about in Europe? Water is also a valuable resource for Europe. Let us stop wasting it; let us conserve this resource. The report that will be put to the vote tomorrow is a comprehensive report that deals with technical aspects, such as leakage from distribution networks, as well as political and societal aspects, such as usage and raising awareness about the efficient use of water. Our responsibility for water is both individual and collective. This report also addresses the issue of problems arising from the scarcity of water and drought, problems that are both immediate and long term in the context of climate change. I would like to point out that it is important to share good practices, since Europe is affected to varying degrees by the scarcity of water, or drought, and therefore the practical experience of all regions is crucial if we are to avoid these phenomena or resolve them. I will even go further by saying that lessons can be learnt from both good and bad practices. I am also satisfied that a link has been made between the availability of water and the quality of water. In fact, Parliament attaches a great deal of importance to this issue of water quality, through texts such as environmental quality standards or the current debate on pesticides. The solution to the scarcity of this resource has many different angles: we need to encourage research and innovation, we need to improve technical and agricultural use, we need to change individual behaviours. Let us act now and disprove the old English adage that ‘you never miss the water till the well runs dry’.

 Mr President, Mr Borloo, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the increase in energy prices is having all kinds of negative effects, the most obvious being the rise in the cost of living for our fellow citizens. This again illustrates just how reliant we are on energy. Various actions are needed if we are to reduce energy price fluctuations and, more especially, drive down prices. I have three proposals to make in this regard. The first course of action concerns the economic management of energy prices. This is something that has to be done right away, in other words the Member States need to develop financial mechanisms whereby the factor of rising prices can be deleted from company budgets and from household budgets too. They also have to promote social measures aimed at combating energy poverty in low-income households. The second line of attack is to work on the prices being charged for imported energy. What are you proposing that will enable the European Union to speak with one voice when dealing with the producer countries – and people are always talking about ‘speaking with one voice’ – so that all these neighbourhood policies and partnership agreements can at last take proper account of the energy dimension? Allow me, perhaps naively, to put forward a solution that might help ease relations in our negotiations with Russia. Why not interconnect the Nabucco gas pipeline operation with the South Stream project? Perhaps this would help calm things down a bit. The third course of action is to reduce imports, or even stop them completely, which would be the ideal solution. To achieve this we need to break the symbiotic link between increasing growth and increasing energy consumption. It is really important that growth should not automatically generate a proportionate rise in energy consumption. Of course we need to develop renewable and low-CO2
 forms of energy, and the report presented by our colleague Mr Turmes is a step in this direction. Being efficient in energy also means saving energy, which is something we are not doing sufficiently at present. The texts that will be tabled here are therefore well overdue. We need to focus on physical and technological energy storage capacities and indeed on those elements that are acting as vehicles for energy consumption. Could you tell us, Mr Borloo, if you have high hopes of the energy-climate package being adopted at any time in the weeks ahead? What would need to happen before an ambitious package of measures is put in place to meet these various objectives?

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate Mrs Sartori, our rapporteur, and the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups. I think the work we have done, though not easy with a text of 2 000 pages, has brought real progress. I will speak first of all on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, for which I was draftsman of the opinion, and then I will speak on behalf of my political group. The Committee on Industry has adopted various amendments, and I am briefly going to mention the main ones. The situation of SMEs had to be taken into account: they expressed their interest in this matter during the preparatory consultation by the Commission. Out of 360 companies, 45%, employing fewer than 250 employees, responded to this online consultation held by the Commission between 21 August and 21 October 2006. Our Committee was keen to highlight the fact that apart from providing necessary information, the purpose of the GHS is also the protection of consumers and the environment. Our Committee called upon the Member States to introduce a procedure that helps all suppliers, particularly SMEs, in certain sectors of production, to determine the correct classification, labelling and packaging of these substances and mixtures. Our Committee was also keen on consistency with REACH and therefore tabled amendments concerning tonnage. Lastly, out of more than just a desire to avoid the duplication of legislation on packaging, our Committee wanted to anticipate the possibility of disputes over the interpretation of the Regulation’s requirements, in this case between the supplier and a Member State and the need for a procedure to ensure classification is harmonised. I now come to my role as shadow rapporteur for the ALDE, and will outline some of the guiding principles of our approach. Of course we welcome this initiative. A global approach is totally consistent with the objective of protecting health and the environment more effectively while allowing for trade in products. Since it is a global system, it is important that the future regulation does not introduce constraints on European firms that do not apply to their international competitors. It would be desirable for the proposal to be consistent with REACH as regards both timeframes and a tonnage-based approach, and where the annexes are concerned, not least Annex VI. As regards the information affixed to finished products, given that the European Commission has chosen to include post-manufacturing, the guiding principle has to be the quality and relevance of information and not the quantity. Our group felt it was important to recognise the existence and value of other sources of information, particularly NGOs and industry, but also the importance of tools for communication such as the internet. The confidentiality of some information must also be protected. Lastly, this legislation must not generate an increase in animal testing. Because of the tight schedule, but also the complexity of the annexes, I recall that MEPs decided not to amend them. The aim of this was also to facilitate the negotiations. This was a major concession by Parliament. However, we have noticed in this case that one of these annexes raises a serious problem of immediate conformity and implementation for the industries concerned. Annex VI is a list of substances with harmonised classifications at European level. A similar list already exists, however, and the industry uses this existing list to classify and label mixtures. But when the transfer took place, modifications were made to this list and it will have to be applied as soon the GHS comes into force, though in the case of technical adaptations, the timeframe for this is at least 18 months. Many SMEs are concerned about this change. It is essential that we reach agreement in the first reading with the Council, and stop publishing provisions as soon as possible to give the industry and users time to adapt to the new system and make it operational by the end of 2008. Consequently, I am asking the Commission to put forward a solution that gives the industry sufficient time to bring itself into conformity with the regulation’s requirements, without having a disproportionate impact. Following the trialogue, apart from the problem with the Annex, the text being put to the vote seems like a good one to me. I would just like to highlight a few salient points. We have talked a great deal about PBTs. They are not covered by the United Nations GHS. Parliament has secured agreement from the European Commission to push for their classification at United Nations level. Parliament has also secured the removal of the division of the ‘eye irritation’ category into sub-categories, which would undoubtedly have led to an increase in the number of tests on animals without adding any real value. We can also report that tests on humans for the sole purpose of this regulation are banned, and that the UN’s GHS is a dynamic process; a mechanism has been found to enable changes to the UN GHS to be taken into account by the European GHS. Confidentiality is protected in a balanced way. Consistency with REACH is guaranteed and Parliament has accepted a zero threshold for inventory and notification, though originally we wanted a threshold of one tonne for certain categories of products. This zero threshold was accepted because substances and mixtures exclusively for R&amp;D purposes are excluded from the scope of application. I think we have done a good job and I am hoping for a good vote and for the GHS to be applied properly.

Mr President, I would like to highlight two elements in relation to the gas market. The first concerns long-term contracts. This type of contract is an important tool for consumers, be they domestic or industrial. It gives us a long-term view of the market and thus ensures that it operates in a more stable and efficient manner. The second concerns the security of systems and, above all, the security of gas supply. Gas transmission networks are of even more strategic interest than electricity networks. The question of ownership is vital in relation to the configuration of the European model, characterised by high dependence on producing countries, which are outside the European Union. For these reasons I support the amendment in favour of the third option, which guarantees non-discriminatory network access. In addition to this, as it did for electricity, my group proposed creating a single European transmission system operator, which would preserve our strategic interests. I would like to reassure my colleague Claude Turmes in this respect. This directive on the gas market does not seek to protect national historical operators but to provide them with the opportunity to be Europe’s great energy champions.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my speech will focus on the issue of ownership unbundling, although I do not think that this is the most important issue. Actually, I think that we have wasted too much time on this issue. To unbundle or not to unbundle, that is not the question. Managing a network requires industrial expertise. Electricity cannot be stored; the frequency and voltage of the grid must be maintained according to market demand. With ownership unbundling, the Commission still faces the risks of speculative or political system operation. The question of ownership, industrial management and network security has not, in my opinion, been sufficiently analysed. That issue aside, we have managed to promote the role of one of the key players in the functioning of the internal market: the regulators. They must be given real powers so that they can exercise their rights and responsibilities. Through the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, regulators will have a pivotal role when it comes to cross-border issues and the harmonisation of technical codes to ensure that our networks function better and are more secure. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has tabled three amendments: the first is to underline that the functioning of the internal market must hinge on the interests of the private and industrial consumer. This is self-evident, but it is still worth repeating. The second concerns long-term contracts which are subject to compliance with certain principles. These should be seen not as a barrier to competition but as a stabilising factor. It should be stressed that this is requested by industrial consumers. Finally, the third is there to provoke discussion. It is a question of the Commission, in consultation with all the market players, contemplating the move to a European transmission system operator. This may be a long way off, but it is an interesting point to consider. The future of the internal electricity market could be guaranteed with a European electricity transmission network.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I want to pay tribute to the work done by our rapporteur, Caroline Jackson, and by Mojka Drčar Murko, rapporteur for our ALDE Group. The question of hazardous waste raises vital issues of traceability, non-dilution, homogeneous storing of information on waste movement over a long period, i.e. five years for all parts of the chain; yet all those issues have been treated rather lightly. That is more than regrettable in terms of health and the environment. In regard to by-products, I am most disappointed. I am not against the concept of by-products: on the contrary, I recognise their importance; but I do feel that the definition given in the Council’s common position does not offer enough guarantees and that at the end of the day it risks destroying the very concept as a result of the possible abuses. Other questions, such as the status of end of waste and the recovery of waste, seem to me to have been sacrificed in the name of an agreement at second reading.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are presenting today at second reading is the outcome of teamwork, thanks to which we have reached an agreement with the Slovenian Presidency and the European Commission. For me, it was a real pleasure to work on seeking a compromise with my co-rapporteurs from the political groups. I was fortunate to have competent and experienced colleagues, who listened carefully and were present at the negotiating meetings. I would like to offer them my warm thanks, and I also want to thank the secretariat of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the political group advisers and my assistant, Sylvain Maréchal. I am using the phrase teamwork because we did excellent work together with the representatives of the Slovenian Presidency, who took account of Parliament’s recommendations, and with the representatives of the European Commission, who gave us answers that made it easier for us to understand this proposal for a directive. I think we can all recognise the fruits of our cooperation in the compromise amendments that will be tabled for the vote tomorrow. So I thank everybody for having helped me in my job as rapporteur on this technical dossier. I come now to the substance. The framework directive on water sets out a strategy to combat the chemical pollution of water. This proposal for a daughter directive aims, by establishing environmental quality standards, to guarantee a high level of protection against the risks that certain substances pose to the aquatic environment. Let me highlight the main advances of this compromise text. We have introduced two major principles: the polluter pays principle and the principle of priority correction at source. The most significant aspects are practical ones. For example, the transitional areas of exceedance – redefined as mixing zones – are no longer simply zones that are established but now serve as a tool for underlining a problem, and it follows that it is up to the Member States to describe the corrective measures. The main object of this directive was to harmonise standards at Community level. As a matter of course, it would therefore be up to the Commission to define the guidelines for harmonising inventories, emissions, discharges and mixing zones. We achieved that. We have also managed to ensure that more account will be taken of the situation of transboundary surface water bodies between Member States but also from third countries. In regard to additional substances, Parliament had hoped to add a consistent number. On the basis of a preliminary filtering, the Commission has selected 13 substances it regards as giving cause for concern. The compromise clearly stipulates that on the basis of scientific data the Commission will have 24 months to pronounce on the final classification and to propose the relevant limit values. That represents fairly considerable progress, because in the main these substances are PCBs, free cyanide, EDTA, dioxins and bisphenols. On the thorny question of sediments and biota, in the absence of scientific consensus, the compromise provides that Member States must monitor them in order to assess the long-term trends of the substances that accumulate there. Finally, surprised that the proposal contained no new measures to monitor emissions, MEPs secured the compromise that stipulates, in Article 7, that the Commission shall, on the basis of reports from Member States, evaluate the effectiveness of existing legislation and progress in the reduction of the extent of the mixing zones, and then make amendments or propose the relevant legislation. In view of those advances, I would ask Members to support this compromise package.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your contribution to this debate. You may ask what our final objectives are with this directive. They are, of course, to improve the quality of bodies of surface water. We do not want to find any more lead, cadmium, nickel, mercury, solvents or other highly toxic and carcinogenic substances such as PCBs in our waters. Mrs Lienemann referred to a news report a fortnight ago that showed that PCBs were bio-accumulated in fish and that man then ate those fish. We can no longer accept such a situation, and I believe that the citizens of Europe may also expect Europe to send out a strong signal that it is protecting our environment, protecting our health. I believe that we will be able to get that European message across if we respect this framework directive on water, together with its daughter directives. Some Members have said that not enough substances were listed, that Parliament had backtracked in relation to the first reading. At first reading we had proposed 33 + 28 substances in total, i.e. 61 analysed substances. At second reading, we have a total of 33 + 13, i.e. 46, but we must point out that these are hazardous substances of particular concern that should no longer occur in river waters today. The other point of interest in this directive is that it allows us to check compliance with European legislation – I am thinking here of the implementation of the REACH regulation and of the IPPC. We now have an instrument to verify that. The Commissioner has heard my colleagues say that if the Council and Parliament approve this text, the ball is in its court. It has an enormous amount of work to do, it has a great many analyses to conduct and inventories to draw up. I wish it all the best. In any case, we will continue to monitor this legislation.

 Minister, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, for experts in the aerospace sector, the name Galileo may conjure up not only an Italian astronomer, but a US space probe designed by NASA to study Jupiter and its dunes, due to be launched on 18 October 1989 from the Atlantis space shuttle. This launch was significantly delayed following a freeze on shuttle flights after the Challenger accident. Ultimately, the success of the Galileo mission within the Jupiter system was spectacular. There are similarities with the European Galileo programme. The programme has experienced setbacks. However, I hope that our programme will prove just as successful. What I hope for above all is that from now on, the name Galileo will be associated with the success of the European programme. Thinking back to the difficult times linked with the failure of the public-private partnership, we need to join forces to get this project off the ground. The European Parliament wanted to learn from the mistakes of the past and to assume its responsibilities as joint budgetary authority. The fact that the European Parliament has finally agreed to keeping a supervisory authority seems important. Expert supervision is in fact necessary, particularly because the Galileo programme is a first for the European Union. This is the first time that the European Union has invested in its own infrastructure. The European Commission will be owner and the European Space Agency will be manager. These responsibilities must be clearly defined and allocated, but also properly monitored. Since Parliament is closely involved in the project, it seems only right that it should be involved in supervising the programme. Therefore, I welcome the creation of this Interinstitutional Monitoring Group, which will be composed of representatives from Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and will allow each institution, particularly ours, to take ownership of the project. The project must succeed. The credibility of the European Union on the international stage and, more importantly, with its citizens, depends on it. To achieve this, I believe that the ESA must rely on the network of European experts, surround itself with the necessary expertise. It will be a case of coordinating the companies building the various parts, to ensure the system’s safety and to control costs. I would like to take the liberty of mentioning a personal view concerning the military use of Galileo. The European Parliament has been forced to severely curtail the possibilities of military use. This is a shame, although perhaps once the programme has matured, it will show that there is a place for careful military use of this tool. Galileo made scientific advances, but also indirectly brought about progress in philosophy and other areas of thinking. Galileo will have huge implications in terms of application, in terms of the independence of our continent, but also in terms of the commitment of the Union.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the effects of climate change are evident and are only going to become more pronounced. We now know that despite the implementation of an ambitious policy to combat climate change we can only stabilise the phenomenon, and we therefore have to adapt to its consequences. Adapting to climate change will require ambitious financing in many areas, and in my view the most important of these are: health, agriculture, water protection, housing and population migrations. To this end, our policy on support for European research should give priority to these areas. Combating greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change should become compulsory conditions for the allocation of European funding. This is a global problem; we thus need global responses. The European Union must make every effort to establish at global level a policy on adapting to climate change. This policy should take account of the growing number of natural disasters when drawing up health and agricultural plans. This policy should focus above all on the most vulnerable countries, i.e. the poorest countries. Just as we can hope to benefit from the fruit of European research, we must ensure that the developing countries benefit from it too. We should transfer our technologies to third countries without necessarily expecting any recompense. However, adapting to climate change does not just mean making greater use of technologies. We also need to look at some of the practices we have inherited from previous generations. For example, in my region, the south-west of France, the old farms face directly to the south: the inhabitants had realised that the direction in which the house faced protected them from the easterly and westerly winds, and made them lighter and warmer in winter and cooler in summer thanks to shade from the trees. They were bioclimatic houses. Today such practices are neglected, and yet they are so simple. We must go back to these simple, sensible actions and continue to encourage research into better housing. It is in this sector that we need to find solutions to avoid, for example, the use of energy for air conditioning in houses. We need to emphasise how important it is for buildings to be energy efficient. Finally, we must move from raising awareness among the public to education and training. We must pass on to the younger generations the appropriate and considered actions and, of course, our generation must learn them too. I would like to finish by congratulating Mr Sacconi on his excellent and polished report.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, research efforts in the steel sector are necessary to protect the European steel industry and therefore the European economy. However, my approach to the coal industry is more guarded. James Hansen, climatologist and research director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, recently declared that the scale of climate change had been underestimated but that we have various tools at our disposal, one of which is the closure of all coal-fired power stations by 2030. One gas-fired power station emits between 300 and 400 kilograms of CO2
 per megawatt-hour, a latest generation coal-fired power station emits 800 kilograms and a power station running on lignite emits 1 000 kilograms of CO2
. How consistent is the European Union being if, on the one hand, it is developing an ambitious plan to combat and adapt to climate change and, on the other, it is supporting coal as a clean energy source? Humanity has gone from the wood age to the coal age, then to the oil age. Today, Parliament has the choice of supporting a return to the coal age or being consistent with the climate package and therefore not establishing coal as a clean energy source. For this reason my Group intends to support some of the amendments by the Verts. In conclusion, allow me to give you a wonderful quote from Alphonse Karr: ‘A lover is almost always a man who, having found a glowing coal, puts it in his pocket believing it to be a diamond.’ Love is indeed passion. For energy, let us opt for reason instead.

 Mr President, I would like to point out four dimensions in which the CAP should evolve. The maintenance of direct aid, which is an essential element: it has been proven that no economy in the world lets its farmers make a decent living without financial support. The environment, which shapes agriculture as much as agriculture shapes the environment. It is therefore important to maintain the conditionality criteria for obtaining aid. Any agreement in the WTO should deal with the issue of protected geographical indications, animal wellbeing and the state of health of imported products, for reasons of fair competition and because health problems do not stop at borders. Finally, it is necessary to define agriculture’s contribution to climate change and sustainable development. I invite the European Commission to examine more closely the question of how much arable land in the European Union can be turned over to biofuels and green chemicals. I welcome this resolution, which is a good reflection of the future challenges for agriculture, both in terms of producing food and in terms of protecting our environment.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this report by Mr Tabajdi. Energy sources are different but they do not all have the same potential, or the same impact on the environment. Regarding the fight against climate change and the wasting of natural resources, it is very important that we do not miss any out. Biogas is one form of energy that should be encouraged. 	 It is important not to create competition between the production of biogas and the production of foodstuffs. To do this, the production of biogas from manure, sludge and municipal, organic and animal waste should be encouraged as a priority. As regards the production of biogas from waste, I would like to stress that this would in fact be to benefit from waste, or pollution, in other words. Make no mistake, however. Above all we need to reduce the volume of waste. Furthermore, I believe it is important that biogas is used not only to produce electricity, but as a priority is used locally, under guaranteed health conditions, to supply natural gas networks. Consequently any technical constraints should be addressed to allow access to the grid. Research and development should also be increased in all aspects of the sector: sources, facilities, distribution and use. A review of the legislation is therefore necessary to take account of the reality and benefits of biogas.

 Mr President, when I spoke in this chamber on this same subject in July 2005, I said that the lessons we would learn from the textiles crisis would eventually help us to maintain and develop other sectors of the European economy. I think we have made some progress, but not very much. Here we are, still demanding more research and development and asking the Commission to make sure that intellectual copyrights are respected. These are decisive factors but they are not enough. It makes me think that, instead of being a factor of the growth of trade and economic development, the WTO and its rules act as a brake. Trade is obviously a source of growth, but in order to be so, it needs to work in both directions. The textiles issue in fact throws up two fundamental problems: the absence of an EU industrial policy and the question of the European interest. As regards the European interest, I welcome with some satisfaction the Commission communication entitled ‘The European Interest: Succeeding in the age of globalisation’, published in early October, which says that we need: ‘to have ground rules which do not impinge on our capacity to protect our interests and to safeguard our high product standards relating to health, safety, the environment and consumer protection’. We will not tolerate third countries that want to operate in the European Union bending the rules applied to the internal market. Commissioner, let us start by applying these principles to the textile industry.

 Commissioner, I hope you can hear the message from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which has made significant amendments to your reform proposal. I support the refusal to allow the automatic liberalisation of planting rights in 2014, particularly for wines protected by designations of origin and geographical indications. For other wines, the decision to liberalise planting rights ought to be taken only after the effects of the COM reform have been gauged. As far as chaptalisation is concerned, I feel that we should not waste our energy on this issue. What matters is maintaining the oenological practices that give European wines their quality and identity. I would particularly like to mention table wines. The Commission’s proposal offers the possibility of referring to a specific place of origin: for example, wine from the coasts of Provence, wine from Andalusia, wine from Tuscany, etc. This will certainly confuse consumers and lead to unfair competition between quality designations of origin, which comply with strict specifications, and table wines, which have much freer production criteria. Let us therefore retain the current legislation, since the only reference ought to be the country in which the wine is produced: Spanish wine, Italian wine, French wine, etc. As to the issue of the information to be provided on the label, I feel that it is important to mention the type of bottler: whether it is an independent winemaker, a group of producers, or some other format. The winemaking profession as practised in France has an extremely positive image, which is not necessarily the case for wines produced in other parts of the world. Therefore, I feel that it is important to provide some information in this respect. Finally, I wish to congratulate our rapporteur, who has largely managed to unite the Members on a compromise text amid a debate which often aroused great passions, sending out a clear message so that the EU remains the world’s leading wine producer, guarantees a future for over one and a half million wine companies, and retains its ranking as leading exporter.

Mr President, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that a number of Member States have already initiated measures to reduce pesticide-related risks, but trends in pesticide use differ from one country to another. For example, certain substances, the use of which is banned in some Member States, are none the less on sale in those states because their use is permitted in other states. There is a clear need to harmonise the rules here in order to ensure that the same conditions apply throughout the Union. The ALDE Group advocates strict control of pesticides, whilst recognising that their use is both a necessity and a reality. We have a number of amendments that are intended to make the text more easily applicable, while sticking to the principle that safer or non-chemical alternatives should be encouraged. My group is keen to focus the volume-reduction targets on dangerous substances. We co-signed an amendment to Article 4 on national action plans, setting as the EU-wide target a 20% reduction in frequency of application within 10 years and 50% rates of reduction for dangerous substances by 2013. Some may think it paradoxical that my group has tabled a further amendment, also to Article 4, offering Member States the option of an approach based on risk reduction. This is, in fact, a more realistic approach but the calculations are more difficult than they are with volume reduction. We thought it was important to put forward this amendment because the question is one that we would wish to see addressed in the interinstitutional discussions after the vote at first reading. I should now like to consider a few specific points. For the protection of watercourses it would seem more logical to take measures tailored to the geological environment, rather than fixing a minimum buffer-zone area. It is legitimate to seek to protect specific living spaces such as parks, children’s playgrounds and school areas because the use of pesticides in proximity to such areas should be restricted to the minimum necessary, or indeed be prohibited, and non-chemical methods should be prioritised. On the fraught question of aerial spraying, the European Commission’s proposal – for a ban in principal with exceptions that must be justified – made a lot of sense. The text from the Committee on the Environment is, however, acceptable. Whilst I understand the need to notify the public of pesticide spraying, I think it has to be left to the Member States to determine the nature and extent of the notification and the means of giving it. We are dealing here with so many different types of terrain and so many different approaches that any attempt to standardise seems unrealistic. The ALDE Group is thus seeking to achieve a balance, the essence of which is that no single party, whether user or manufacturer, should be penalised but rather that rigorous and consistent legislation should be introduced: allowing pesticide users to protect their crops; allowing manufacturers to sell products that will gradually become less harmful; and allowing consumers not only to eat safe food but also to live in a safe environment.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Reul’s report is a very good and thorough report and I congratulate him on it. I am astonished, however, at the space it devotes to coal. Coal is undoubtedly an abundant energy source. It is also the world’s most widespread source of fossil energy. I am concerned, however, at its increasingly predominant role in electricity generation. The impression is given that carbon capture and storage technology will solve the problem of greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power stations, but I must confess that I am sceptical. There are coal-fired power stations all over the world: is it possible to equip them all with carbon capture systems? How will we manage to prevent CO2
 emissions from the so-called ‘clean’ coal-fired plants? Is there not a risk that, having already experienced the eras of wood burning, coal burning and oil burning, we might now be taking a backward step into another coal burning era? To conclude on a more optimistic note, the report’s strength lies, in my opinion, in its proposal for the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan. The plan needs to address the necessary diversification of energy sources by 2020, 2030 and 2050 and it must also reflect the importance of resource use at regional level.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Vidal-Quadras on his work: on a thorny issue and in return for a large number of amendments, he has managed to ensure that the text to be adopted by Parliament lists the options that will enable us to steer the direction of the debates to come this autumn. Through this report, the crucial role of the national regulators has been reaffirmed. Independence, convergence and increased harmonisation of their powers are crucial not only in terms of transparency, communication and responsibility, but also in terms of relations with the transport network managers. We must overcome the technical and regulatory disparities that are hindering cross-border trade and the interconnection thereof. In my view, the regulators should approve the necessary investments on the proposal of the network managers and ensure that such investment takes place. The desire of the European Commission to have national regulators cooperate more with each other is therefore along the right lines. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe welcomes the fact that this House has highlighted the need for different approaches for the electricity sector and the gas sector. The gas sector needs specific solutions taking account of the differences between upstream and downstream markets. Thus, gas producers are for the most part located outside the European Union and do not abide by the same rules as those of the internal market. Ownership unbundling of the networks could make European gas companies more fragile. With regard to regulated tariffs, we think it necessary for the Member States gradually to do away with their application, but to keep the option of last resort tariffs so as to protect the most vulnerable consumers. I shall conclude with the point that has provoked debate: the issue of ownership unbundling. As far as the ALDE Group is concerned, the objective of having all operators treated in a transparent and non-discriminatory way by network managers is a crucial element of the proper functioning of the internal market. On this issue, my point of view differs from that of some of my colleagues, because I do not believe that this ownership unbundling is the key element that will enable the internal market to be completed. After it has been imposed – if this option proves to be the wrong one – the damage could harm European companies and, ultimately, the security of supply. I feel that it is more important to establish a code of good conduct for network managers, to make the necessary investments and to increase the power of the regulators. We need both great European energy champions and competition for the market to work. What we need to do is to regulate price transparency and to prevent excessive pricing, because, as needs go, energy is a vital one for Europeans and for the European economy.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you pointed out just now, Commissioner, that the chemical pollution of surface waters was a threat to the aquatic environment, the ecosystem and, hence, human safety. You said, in fact, that the aim of this daughter directive of the water framework directive was to combat the spread of toxic substances in surface waters. To this end, an inventory of emissions, discharges and losses is to be implemented with the aim of verifying whether the objectives of reducing or phasing out emissions and losses of pollutants have been met, in accordance with Article 13(7) of the framework directive, the deadline for the phase-out objective being 2025. In fact, this directive will result in the abrogation of the existing daughter directives that are cited in Annex IX to the framework directive. This directive therefore sets limits in terms of the concentration in surface waters of certain types of pesticides, heavy metals and other chemical substances that endanger aquatic flora and fauna and human safety. The impact studies that have been carried out by the Commission have resulted in the definition of environmental quality standard levels, expressed as an annual average offering a level of protection against long-term exposure and as a maximum allowable concentration, for protection against short-term exposure. However, some of the EQS values are still subject to debate, not least those relating to benzene and cadmium, hexachlorobenzene and hexachlorobutadiene, mercury, nickel, lead and poly-aromatic hydrocarbons too, because some impact studies have not been finished, a state of affairs that has, in spite of everything, hampered us in our debates. The amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety highlight the desire to establish common methodologies aimed at guaranteeing an appropriate level of protection and at preventing distortions of competition among the Member States. We also wondered about the possibility of authorising transitional areas of exceedance. Indeed, if we deleted this paragraph, would we be any further forward? What matters, in fact, is the area of analysis. If we did not define any transitional areas, there might be a perverse effect, whereby we avoided controls in those areas and, therefore, were unaware of what was going on there. We have therefore proposed to allow the Member States the option of establishing transitional areas, but with the obligation of reducing these areas in order to reach the environmental quality standards in the long term. We also mentioned the special case of port areas where, due to the mixing of bodies of water caused by the dredging of rivers and estuaries, the quality standards and analysis methods appear unsuitable. We discussed at length the advisability of adding highly toxic substances to the list of substances initially proposed by the Commission. A compromise was finally reached on this matter. We call for the Commission to carry out an analysis of these new listed substances and for it to give its opinion on their final classification, as priority substances or as priority hazardous substances, and to do so at the latest 12 months after the entry into force of this directive. Our compromise relates to new emission control measures. We would emphasise emissions control. While the Commission is in fact relying on the existence of other legislative provisions on chemical pollutants, such as REACH, IPPC or indeed the Pesticides Directives, we call for the Commission to carry out a thorough assessment of the consistency and effectiveness of all the legislative acts that exist and that are liable to have an impact on water quality and, if necessary, to adapt or propose new acts. To conclude, I should like to thank the Commission representatives and the various people who helped me to draft this report and, of course, my fellow draftsmen of the opinion, for their constructive cooperation on a very technical matter. I must say that it was a pleasure to work with them. I now call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to endorse this report so that we obtain a text that makes it possible to monitor the effectiveness of EU environmental legislation, that is to say, a text that makes it possible to know whether, by 2025, we will have succeeded in eliminating the emissions from these substances that are highly toxic for human beings and for the environment.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report that is to be put to the vote tomorrow is a balanced one, one that has avoided the pitfalls that traditionally imperil debates on nuclear energy. In reviewing the present state of play, it sets out where nuclear energy fits into the range of options available and takes a neutral line on what future it has in Europe. The Euratom Treaty is a means of putting the use of nuclear power in Europe into a legal framework without being the means whereby it is promoted. Taken as a virtual whole, its chapters are living and useful, and that is one reason why it must not be broken up; the other is that it constitutes a coherent framework for controlling the use of nuclear energy in the European Union and ensuring that it is to the benefit of all the Member States. It makes it possible for new Member States to take on board a solid acquis communautaire
 covering every aspect of nuclear energy – research, the sharing of knowledge, security, waste management, protection against radiation, joint projects, materials management, the Supply Agency, relations with external bodies - and, while it is for each Member State to decide for or against nuclear power, the Treaty comprises numerous useful provisions for the states that have not opted for it, including the protection of workers and the strict control of nuclear materials in the European Union. As regards its future direction, the report calls for European legislation on nuclear safety and waste management, while also highlighting the democratic deficit of the Treaty and suggests ways in which this might be remedied. While acknowledging, then, the usefulness of a legal framework applicable to the use of nuclear power in Europe, it is open to certain adaptations, without prejudging the means, but I nevertheless want to say that there are those in my group who would like the report to mention that the intergovernmental conference is the preferred option when it comes to reducing the democratic deficit and, in particular, to giving this House the power of codecision on certain chapters. I will conclude by saying that I endorse this report and would like to congratulate Mr Maldeikis on being such a good listener and on doing such a good piece of work.

 The A380 is expected to be a success, and evidence of that is the fact that the city of Los Angeles, in competition with New York, has just asked Airbus if it might be the first to welcome the European jumbo; yet the company is in crisis due to a lack of proper management, the well-known consequence of which is the ‘Power 8’ plan for economies and restructuring. Airbus’s managers have lessons to learn from the industrial mismanagement that caused delays in the delivery of aircraft. The Member States, for their part, need to give the European aerospace industry a secure future, while those of them that are shareholders need to do something about the company’s management by reviewing the dual organisational model and renegotiating the shareholders’ agreement. They must also act in solidarity by maintaining and developing the European aerospace industry, which means, among other things, making additional loans available for research, placing public orders, advancing funds for the investments needed in industrial sites or, indeed, increasing the States’ shareholding – this being exactly what the American state did with Boeing. What the industry now needs as a matter of urgency is the renegotiation of the ‘Power 8’ plan with the unions, taking on board their arguments about strategy. How, after all, can one accept the unbalanced way in which this plan proposes to share out work between the French and German sites? How is one to accept the idea that Toulouse, on whose two production lines twenty planes a month can be produced, should be limited to fourteen a month, with the construction of the other A320s being moved to Hamburg, necessitating investment in a new production line? How is one supposed to accept the effect on jobs at suppliers and sub-contractors, the effect on regional economies and the loss of know-how and expertise if sites’ activities are moved elsewhere? How are people supposed to entrust innovation and development to others? Airbus has orders for 2 589 aircraft on its books, so it has a full work programme for many years to come, and the quality of the aircraft it builds ought to see it through this crisis, but, in fact, there is only one thing to aim for: the promotion of Airbus as a European project creating jobs, achieving innovation and excellence in the eyes of the whole world and built by the men and women of Europe.

 Commissioner, Mrs Batzeli, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union's wine-growing sector represents an extremely important economic activity, particularly in terms of exports. The European Union is the world's premier vineyard. Global wine consumption is on the increase, and yet the European wine sector is in crisis: it is a very paradoxical situation. We here in Parliament have been working passionately on the outline of a reform of the common organisation of the market in wine. Wine producers are using their know-how to keep traditions going in modern viticulture. These men and women are passionate about their work, and it is our responsibility to be passionate in defending them, in helping them to face economic realities and in showing them our support. The Commission's response to passion, however, is a cold 'large-scale grubbing up, liberalisation of planting rights and abolition of distillation mechanisms'. In my opinion, this report on which we will be voting on Thursday shows that Parliament is responding with a proposal for reforms, admittedly, but progressive reforms. I think we need to leave the Member States, and particularly the regions, considerable room for manoeuvre in this matter: no one can deny that, in some regions, nothing grows except grapevines; nor can anyone deny the contribution that wine producers have made to the structure of the countryside. Through their competences in town and country planning, the Member States and the regions therefore have the necessary capabilities to assess plantation or grubbing-up policies, in close cooperation with producers and representatives of the sector. It is true that some of the instruments in the current common market organisation are now inappropriate, or are not being used properly, but I nevertheless expect the Commission to take the time to work with the Member States to analyse the consequences of the abolition or replacement of those instruments, particularly distillation mechanisms. I expect the Commission to propose instruments to regulate the market and to manage potential crises. The recipe is simple: quality wine, and promotion. Global wine consumption is on the increase, and the economic and cultural boom in certain countries is being accompanied by an interest in drinking wine. It is important for the Community's wine sector to be made more competitive, by means of actions instituted at all stages of production and marketing. In terms of œnological practices, the new wine-producing countries have more flexible regulations. I think we need to be careful to avoid the character of our wines becoming globalised. We certainly need to relax the restrictions imposed on European producers and enable them to adapt to demand and improved competitiveness. I support a ban on the vinification of imported grape must, and on mixing it with Community must. I would like, by way of conclusion, to remind you, Commissioner, that wines have a flavour of the land on which they are grown, the colour of the seasons and the spirit of the wine producers. They have the flavour of the country, of the European Union. It reminds me of an anonymous quotation: 'to make a great wine, you need a passionate fool to grow the vines, a wise man to regulate them, a lucid artist to make the wine, a lover to drink it and a poet to sing of its glory'.

 Mr President, thinking ahead to 2030-2050, will fossil fuels have run out? Will the ITER project have kept its promise on fusion? Given the huge growth of China and India, will energy resources be sufficient? What will the effects of growth be on the climate? We do not necessarily have all the answers to these questions, but what is clear is that we must act within the framework of a European and world strategy, because energy is a fundamental need and the phenomenon of global warming must be stopped. I welcome the ambitious objectives consisting of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2020, because the EU must send out a strong message that behaviour and mentalities must be changed so that innovative solutions with global impact might be found. I also welcome the measures proposed by the Commission, but they must be accompanied by political action. Accordingly, more must be done to force the Member States to take more proactive measures, for example in connection with the use of biofuels and renewable energies, and to take taxation measures to foster energy saving and to promote the energy efficiency of buildings. Moreover, without wishing to be alarmist, a European communication campaign should be launched, with the support of the media, in order to present the citizens of Europe with simple things that anyone can do to help protect the climate. The future we desire will come about through fundamental technological development, as well as through actions that we can all carry out, starting today.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will allow me to make a few comments on the various topics that we are discussing this morning. In the report on nuclear safety and security assistance, the European Union gives itself the task of improving nuclear safety and security worldwide by proposing an instrument for cooperation with third countries. The European Union's responsibility is not to prevent the construction of new power stations or to demand that existing plants be shut down, decisions that fall within the sovereignty of the States, but to promote a culture of nuclear safety. I therefore find the two amendments from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which recommend more than the minimum, regrettable. It is early intervention, before plants are put into operation, that will make it possible to lay down what safety measures need to be taken. This morning, Parliament is also proposing an ambitious report on biomass and biofuels, which are important elements in energy independence for the EU and in the fight against climate change. It will, however, be necessary to keep a close eye on the overall energy yield of biomass. Finally, I would have liked to have seen a stronger message from Parliament with regard to the European Commission's Green Paper, particularly in terms of the effort needed to reduce energy consumption in buildings and in transport. To take another example, we have once again glossed over the debate on nuclear power. We have to acknowledge that nuclear power is part of the energy mix, that it helps to combat climate change and, what is more, that our expertise in this field is recognised worldwide. I would also remind you that we need to encourage the network managers to get together to draw up a European code, in order to control the safety of energy transport networks. Finally, now that private consumers are going to be faced with the opening up of the energy market, it is high time to consider the role of the regulators and to adapt the directives on the internal market with a view to keeping prices under control. Energy is an absolute necessity, and it is vital for European citizens, particularly the poorest, to have access to this universal service.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, water is one of the most abundant resources on the planet: the oceans and seas cover 70% of the Earth's surface and produce three quarters of the oxygen we breathe. However, we can only actually use 1% of this water, and many human activities are putting a major strain on the resource. Polluted water, regardless of where the pollution comes from, gets back into nature one way or another, and is therefore liable to harm human health and the environment. This proposal for a directive is a step forward for the protection of groundwater and in preventing its deterioration, because it provides for compliance with the precautionary principle, specifically in Article 6. It will now be the responsibility of the Member States to take the necessary measures to prevent and limit the discharge of hazardous substances by defining zones to guarantee the protection of the bodies of water in question. Farmers will be able to obtain compensation to cover the loss of revenue attributable to the obligations imposed in the protection zones, particularly in drinking water catchment zones. Parliament will also be more deeply involved in future decisions, because it will be able to oppose amendments to the list of pollutants. I would therefore like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, and Mr Florenz and Mrs Roth-Behrendt for the tenacity they demonstrated during the negotiations with the Council and the Commission. Parliament's delegation succeeded in toughening the obligations imposed on Member States with regard to the protection of groundwater. Under these circumstances, I recommend that we adopt the joint draft at third reading.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, rapporteurs, I hear my fellow Members express their disappointment. However, the compromise that is before us this week is in my view an acceptable agreement, since it has been reached on the basis of reciprocal concessions. I would like to highlight the work of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in this regard. So far as substitution is concerned, this had to be included in the debate on authorisation, as it is ultimately aimed at eliminating highly dangerous substances. Mandatory substitution was a fine objective, but not a realistic solution from a technical point of view. I can see one consequence of the compromise that has been reached here: undertakings will have to compete to develop substances with safer properties. Those that discover such alternative substances will therefore occupy a more favourable position on the market and the search for alternative substances will therefore become a challenge for them. I believe Article 137 of the compromise, on review, is important. An evaluation of the application of this mammoth piece of legislation after the first few years is essential. We will in fact already be in a position to assess how far we have come. At the same time, I think it will give us an opportunity to clarify the treatment of certain products, the intrinsic properties and uses of which have been known for a long time, such as lime and batteries, on which we have just adopted legislation. I do not believe these products are dealt with adequately in the present text. The fact that substances present in the natural state are treated in the same way as substances that are entirely artificial is a matter of particular concern to me. Another thing that concerns me is how this legislation will be put into practice by SMEs. When I last spoke in this House, I said we would have succeeded the day we adopted a system that was balanced, simple, effective and that enterprises could use. I rather doubt that we have achieved that. For that reason, I would like the Member States, trade associations, and NGOs, too, to create a climate that will allow SMEs to meet the requirements of this legislation, thereby helping to achieve its objectives. Moreover, since this legislation applies to imported products, it will have to gain acceptance in third countries, which will also have to begin to design and develop chemical products that do not harm human health or the environment. I believe this is an extremely important point. Finally, I hope that, at the forthcoming round of World Trade Organisation talks, where it might be expected that the European Union will raise non-tariff customs barriers, the EU will promote REACH as legislation necessary for the survival of the human race and the natural world.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to pay tribute to the excellent work performed by my fellow rapporteurs and, more generally, by the three institutions to pave the way for the rapid adoption of this research package. The Seventh Framework Programme is the key instrument for the creation of a European research area in which the aim is to devote 3% of GDP to research. It must serve to make national research policies cross-pollinate and complement each other and to promote consistency between the priorities of the Member States and the main aims to be defined by the European Research Council. In spite of a budget that is less substantial than the Commission and Parliament had hoped, this Framework Programme should be appreciated for its leverage. In view of the need to overcome difficulties in accessing finance, particularly for SMEs, the introduction of a funding mechanism and of risk-sharing is a step in the right direction. This mechanism must serve to increase the number of loans granted by the European Investment Bank and the financial institutions, to commit greater sums of money and to support riskier projects. As far as the Euratom rules of participation for the Seventh Framework Programme are concerned, my strategy was to work in close collaboration with Mr Busquin, rapporteur on the rules governing the conventional Framework Research and Development Programme, in order to preserve the similarity between these two drafts and thereby benefit from the codecision procedure. This is why the compromise amendments proposed to you are the fruit of discussions between the Commission, the Council and Parliament on Mr Busquin's report, adapted for the realm of nuclear energy. Two amendments, however, diverge from the Council's position. In fact, we wanted to specify, by means of Amendment 58, the selection and award criteria, such as scientific excellence, the ability to carry out the action successfully, relevance to the objectives of the specific programme, the critical mass of resources mobilised and the quality of the plan for the utilisation and dissemination of acquired knowledge. May I also draw your attention to Amendment 88 of this report, for which some Members have requested a separate vote. This amendment is not incompatible with the choice of Barcelona as the seat of the joint undertaking. Indeed the location of the seat is firmly enshrined in Council Decision 2006/458, and we approve of the choice. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the other activities envisaged within the thematic area of fusion energy are implemented and managed separately from the joint undertaking so that the researchers can develop their creative potential. This separation would thus serve to maintain the integrated approach and the close involvement of the fusion associations, particularly through the European Fusion Development Agreement. This point was raised during the trialogues with the Commission and the Council on the rules of participation with a view to clearly defining the roles of each. The aims of this report on the rules of participation are to provide European support for research activities in the field of atomic energy in the hope of undoing the technological locks in the nuclear domain and particularly of fulfilling the promise of fusion for future energy production. I wish to express my very sincere thanks to Mr Busquin, who put his skills and experience at my disposal and who involved me in all the meetings at which the compromise amendments were negotiated with the Council and the Commission. Let me now conclude my remarks with a few words on the specific programmes that I have monitored more closely on behalf of my group. As far as the direct actions conducted by the Joint Research Centre are concerned, it is worth noting that the Centre's expertise has been extended into areas of considerable political and public interest, such as the development of alternatives to animal testing, social welfare, sustainable agriculture and protection of the environment. In the realm of nuclear energy, we would like the Joint Research Centre to play a greater role in fostering public awareness and providing training. It is also our wish that the Joint Research Centre should lend its expertise to the effort to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The specific programme on cooperation must help to address social, economic and environmental challenges by focusing on areas such as health, energy or the environment and climate change. The lengthy catalogue of amendments tabled by the European Parliament is akin, in some people's eyes, to a shopping list, and its very length indicates above all that a great deal of research is expected. Let us bear in mind the place and role of the European Union in the world but more especially in the lives of its people. A successful Framework Programme would be proof that the European Union is moving forward.

Mr President, I must explain that I am speaking on behalf of Mrs Fourtou, who has been dealing with this matter for our group but has been prevented from attending by other commitments. Mrs Fourtou wishes to express her special thanks to Mr Hasse Ferreira for his work as well as to her honourable colleagues from the other political groups. She found it agreeable to work in an atmosphere where everyone was prepared to listen and to operate in complete transparency. She took part in the various trialogues and fully supports the rapporteur's approach. She regrets, however, that a Council amendment removes the obligation on Member States to draw up correlation tables. In fact, since the conclusion of the interinstitutional agreement in 2003, the three institutions have been committed to better legislation and have acknowledged the importance of these tables. The Council, apparently, no longer wishes to honour that commitment. Be that as it may, Mrs Fourtou thanks the rapporteur and the Finnish Presidency and notes that both of them tried to defend the correlation tables. Not wishing to block the procedure, she persuaded our group to vote in favour of the compromise amendments and of the report.

Thank you for your communication, Commissioner. It is imperative that an extensive and rigorous investigation be carried out into the causes of the power cut that affected a number of EU countries. Should this breakdown be attributed to a lack of information? To a failure to comply with procedures? To a network fault? To a shortage of investment? To a fault in the maintenance of the network or to a commercial cause? Some Europeans view this breakdown as a disastrous consequence of the liberalisation of energy; others view it as the product of inadequate interconnections and of an inadequate trans-European energy network. As you pointed out, one might also take the view that the management of this breakdown demonstrated the Member States’ solidarity towards Germany, deprived as it was of electricity, and that the power cut procedures were implemented in order to prevent far more serious consequences resulting from a European black out. If the breakdown was a commercial one, the Member States' regulators must together define and review the applicable rules in order more effectively to control the electricity market. If the breakdown was due to technical problems, or to a procedural fault, then the power distribution network managers need to be coordinated more effectively, as they are the operational links in the chain of free flowing and secure energy exchanges. The creation of a European Centre for Energy Networks would enable us to implement a European code of networks aimed at harmonising the standards and procedures of the Member States’ networks. To conclude, I am delighted that the Commission has launched this investigation and I hope – allow me to emphasise this point – that it communicates the results with all due transparency so that we might make progress in preventing any incidents of this kind.

Mr President, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Hegyi, on the work he has done. We have here a report that asks the right questions and that offers some good answers. This report highlights the need for consistency and cooperation, something that some Members call the ‘integrated approach’ and that the European Commission communication echoes. We need an overall view so as to better understand the urban environment challenge, particularly in social, cultural and environmental terms. I approve of the emphasis given in this report to a number of fundamental points: exchanging best practices and promoting the training of local players; controlling the growing volume of traffic and decoupling transport growth and GDP growth; encouraging people to save energy and improving the energy efficiency of buildings; making the implementation of sustainable urban management plans and sustainable urban transport plans compulsory for every urban area with more than 100 000 inhabitants; and, finally, proposing a per capita target in relation to green areas in new urban developments. I believe that we do, however, need to find the right balance between giving instructions to the Member States and giving the power of initiative to local players, because they represent a breeding ground for innovation, having, as they do, first-hand experience of the realities of urban life. Our aim must in fact be to create a framework that will give rise to local initiatives by leaving the choice of targets and solutions up to local decision-makers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support the aims of this directive, which forms part of European environmental policy. As a member of Parliament’s delegation to the Conciliation Committee, I advocated a degree of flexibility, especially for accumulators that allow safety requirements to be met. The wording proposed by the Conciliation Committee not only allows ambitious rules and targets to be retained – especially in terms of collection and recycling – but also allows account to be taken of reality and of the efforts being made by the manufacturers of accumulators, especially for industrial use. Distributor take-back is in fact adopted as the default method of collection, but schemes that are already working can be retained, provided an assessment, which must be made public, shows that they are at least as effective as distributor take-back. This guarantee of equivalent effectiveness in terms of collection seems to me to be crucial for a flexible but non-permissive system. Moreover, appliances must be designed in such a way that used batteries and accumulators are easy to remove and they must be accompanied by instructions containing information for consumers. However, these provisions will not apply where, for safety, performance, medical or data integrity reasons, continuity of power supply is necessary and a permanent connection between the appliance and the battery is required. Once again, flexibility is closely circumscribed. I nevertheless remain sceptical about capacity labelling of portable and automotive batteries and accumulators; and while I understand this concern for consumer information, I think that too many variables, such as conditions of use and usage, affect the life of such batteries and accumulators. Finally, the joint text that is being put to the vote seems to me to bring balanced responses to the different institutions’ demands. I therefore invite you to vote in favour of this text, and I thank our rapporteur for the quality of his work.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like some of my fellow Members, I signed this oral question on the use of wood chippings as an œnological practice for European wines. I signed it because I wonder whether, and hope that, guarantees can be given to ensure that the quality wines we are producing in Europe are and continue to be recognised as quality wines. It would not shock me at all if this practice were to be recognised and authorised. The wine production sector has been waiting for this recognition because it will allow some producers to meet the expectations of international consumers. Furthermore, there will be no compulsory expansion of this practice: the Member States will still be free to lay down restrictive legislation for quality wines produced in specified areas. Nevertheless, I think we need both guarantees regarding the provision of information on wines that have undergone this practice and also quality guarantees. I would like to emphasise that the recognition of this practice, which has been imported from countries outside the European Union, does not legitimise other practices that do not seem to provide the necessary quality guarantees both in terms of health and in terms of identity. Wine is a very particular product that conveys an identity and a whole way of life, so let us not move too rapidly towards the practice of 'patchwork' wines. Finally, I would like to take advantage of this debate to lay the emphasis on the forthcoming Common Market Organisation (CMO) review, which should give European viticulture a real solution for the future. European wine producers need to get the benefit from the worldwide growth in the wine market, and this needs to be ensured through a redistribution of the financial aid from the CMO. The decoupling of aid could be the solution that will enable us to give greater responsibility to those active in the sector, with the benefit that all the wine produced will have outlets on the consumer market. We need to re-examine the distillation conditions – for potable alcohol and crisis distillation – as part of a system based on a degressive guide price over the course of the campaign. Equally, we need to encourage the use of vine-based products to enrich wines, for example using grape must instead of sugar. In order to ensure that European wines retain their position as world leaders, the European Union must use the new CMO to construct a policy for promotion, marketing, research and development and training, and it also needs to establish an economic observatory. There is absolutely no doubt that we need to reform the restructuring, planting and grubbing up systems in order to respond to the needs of the market over the medium to long term, but we also need to preserve the surface area of vineyards – in other words, we need to preserve the European Union's wine-growing potential. It is quite inconceivable for European vineyards to disappear from our landscapes, from our history and from our rural and cultural heritage, which has been shaped over so many years by wine producers on land uniquely suited to growing grapes. What will become of this land and of those who live off it, those who have worked to improve their art for the great pleasure of consumers, or perhaps I could say gourmets.

 Mr President, my contribution to the debate on this Seventh Framework Programme on Research and Development will relate to two subjects: the stem cells issue and the budget. Research in the field of embryonic stem cells has enabled medicine to make a great leap forward. A lot of hope is pinned on this research, particularly in connection with the treatment not only of cancer but also of genetic diseases hitherto regarded as incurable, as well as in connection with the perfecting of medicines. The European Union needs to make cautious but definite progress in this area. That is why it has put in place the world’s most advanced monitoring and evaluation system, involving the agreement of the programming committee, analyses by independent experts and by national and European committees on ethics and, not least, the obligation to respect the legal frameworks of the Member States in which the research is carried out. It is vital to fund research on embryonic stem cells for a number of reasons: to monitor activities in this area, to ensure that our ethical values are respected, to facilitate and protect scientific advances made by European researchers and to enable us to go on competing with third countries. That is why it is the amendment adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy that should be voted in favour of next Thursday. With regard to the budget, I can only join the previous speakers in deploring how little it amounts to. I would nonetheless warn against the temptation to draw on funds from areas such as agriculture and energy, which are in need of money while other sectors appear to have been funded too generously. In this connection, I think it imperative to hold a debate on the funding of the Joint Research Centre. At the same time as commending our rapporteur for his excellent work, I very much wish, in conclusion, to emphasise how crucially important this programme is. By putting in place a European Research Area, we reduce the risk of those who develop innovative projects going and looking for their sources of funding elsewhere. It is a way of giving a dramatic boost to growth and competitiveness. The Seventh FPRD is one of the means that will enable Europe to move forward and our people to benefit in everyday life from the fruits of European research.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me most sincerely to thank my fellow draftsmen from the other political groups, in particular Mrs Ayuso and Mr Swoboda, who have supported me throughout my assessment and who have contributed a great deal to the text that is presented to you today and that will be submitted for your approval tomorrow. I should like to thank the representatives of the European Commission and of the secretariat of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their listening skills and their responses to the issues raised. I should also like to highlight the positive role played by the Austrian Presidency, which has endeavoured to find wordings that, being based on Parliament’s first reading, would win the support of the Member States.  I believe that it is worth pointing out the objectives of this proposal for a decision. It is a question of guaranteeing a European label for the Olefin transport networks, thereby enabling them to lay claim to loans from the European Investment Bank, of adapting the guidelines to the shape of a European Union composed of 25 Member States, of authorising the funding of projects of common interest, of enabling an internal market in gas and electricity to be created and, above all, of ensuring the security of supply, thanks to interconnections between Member States and neighbouring countries: countries in South-East Europe, Mediterranean countries, Ukraine and Belarus. Whereas the Council common position, which was communicated in January, proposed a different approach to that of Parliament in that it rejected the declaration of European interest and the appointment of a coordinator, the work at second reading enabled compromise amendments to be drafted during informal trialogues, which involved Parliament, the Presidency of the Council and the European Commission. These compromise amendments entirely correspond to our objectives at first reading. Among other things, they define the projects of European interest as a series of projects on priority axes which are of a cross-border nature or which have significant impact on cross-border transmission capacity. It will thus be possible for these projects to be considered as priorities for funding under the category of trans-European energy networks and to receive special attention under the category of other Community funds. The delay in implementation will be looked into, and the joint coordination meetings will address, in particular, the evaluation and the public consultation procedures. These amendments will also provide a better definition of the role of the European coordinator, who it will be possible to appoint when a project experiences significant delays or problems to do with implementation. This coordinator will promote the European dimension of the project, will help coordinate national procedures for consulting the populations concerned and will submit an annual progress report on the project. Commissioner, allow me, however, to express two regrets. On the one hand, the low level of funding available for trans-European energy networks, which is probably only just enough to fund a few feasibility studies. On the other hand, you are aware that Parliament did not want to question the legitimacy of the projects featuring in the annexes to the report. Nevertheless, it seems to me that priority ought to be given to projects that help secure the supply of as many States as possible, thereby promoting this European dimension. I am thinking, in particular, of the Baltic States, whose gas networks are by no means enough to provide them with a secure and sustainable supply, bearing in mind that priority was given to the Russian-German gas pipeline as a result of the agreements made between Mr Schröder and Mr Putin. I call on you to encourage the implementation of the infrastructure needed in order to supply all States. In view of the recent crisis between Ukraine and Russia and of the statements made at Hampton Court, a European energy policy is essential. This text therefore provides the European institutions with the opportunity to demonstrate their desire for such a policy. The new provisions introducing the declaration of European interest and the opportunity to appoint a coordinator are tools crucial to creating a genuine internal market in gas and electricity and to guaranteeing the security of supply. This European network can only be achieved, however, by increasing the number of interconnections. Ladies and gentlemen, I call on you to support the common position as amended by this compromise package. Our vote will enable us to provide the Union with one of the tools needed in order to attain the objectives that it has set itself.

 Mr President, innovation in the field of ICT is progressing so rapidly that there is a risk that the European Union, which invests only EUR 80 per capita compared with the equivalent of EUR 350 in Japan and EUR 400 in the United States, will soon be left behind. The EU must therefore increase investment in research and urge the Member States to do the same. On the other hand, the fast pace of innovation means that there is a risk that the digital divide, and therefore social divides, will widen, to the detriment of the social and territorial cohesion that we are working towards. It is therefore vital that we build an information society based on inclusion, and on broad take-up of information and communication technologies in public services, SMEs and households. The success of the i2010 strategy requires the European Commission to put forward proposals to make these technologies accessible to all citizens, taking account of the crucial role given to the regions, to safeguard the principles of freedom and pluralism of the media, and to set out clear actions to protect against illegal and harmful content and to protect minors and human dignity, while also protecting privacy. The Commission also needs to put the emphasis on effective use of ICT in public services, particularly in health and education. Finally, although I am in favour, in the medium term, of opening up the market following a period of transition towards the implementation of general competition rules, I would point out that the Treaties define the rules for free competition, and at the same time call for economic, social and territorial cohesion. Freedom of competition in the field of ICT must not result in the private sector refusing to invest in unprofitable infrastructure. The role of states and regions will therefore be a determining factor in encouraging the development of the necessary infrastructure. It is up to us to make ICT a real tool for economic development and for social and territorial cohesion in the European Union. I would like to thank Mr Paasilinna for the high quality of his work, and my fellow Members for their contributions to the debate.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is a balanced one. Although it does not endorse the idea of a common forestry policy, it does stress the need for coordination. The report acknowledges that Member States vary in their definitions of what is meant by the word ‘forest’, which makes it difficult to offer a definitive assessment of important Community forestry measures. I, for one, am disappointed that the proposal to set up a European observatory has not been adopted. Such an observatory would have led to the use of reliable, retrievable data. That aside, I support the proposals calling on the Commission to improve coordination between the various Directorates-General concerned with forestry issues and to strengthen the role of the Standing Forestry Committee. I tabled an amendment calling on the Commission to make proposals to the Member States based, in particular, on tax arrangements and designed to encourage forest owners to plant indigenous species in order to maintain biodiversity and reduce fire risks. The spirit of this proposal was echoed in the report, which recommends the adoption of measures for the prevention of fires and desertification, afforestation with native species, the promotion of diversity, the sustainable management of natural forests and the promotion of environmental services, particularly with a view to protecting water systems and combating erosion. The implementation of these measures entails investments on the part of forest owners. As they provide benefits to society, they deserve to be duly compensated. Lastly, the report takes account of my hopes and fears for the sector. It sets out the priority axes for a policy that will be global, yet will cater specifically for each region, taking account of the economic, social and environmental potential of the forestry sector. Thank you, Mr Kindermann, for your work, which I believe will secure a large majority in tomorrow’s vote.

Mr President, a simple ban on nickel-cadmium accumulators seems appealing to me at first glance, but a more in-depth analysis prompts me to recommend real derogations in terms of the industrial use of these accumulators. In particular, these accumulators are used in the security and transport sectors – in aeroplanes and trains, for example. These accumulators are much sought-after for their operational reliability in critical conditions, which makes it difficult to introduce alternative products. The rules are already very strict. The risks connected to the end of life of this type of accumulator are controlled, not least by means of the producers taking responsibility for the collection and recycling of their accumulators. Ladies and gentlemen, I draw your attention to the definitions adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which give precedence to the physical characteristics of the battery over the way in which it is used. Certain batteries would therefore, in all likelihood, become de facto casualties of the ban, such as those used in breathing apparatus systems employed in toxic atmospheres, lamps for individual or collective use in the mining sector, and so on.

Mr President, like most of the speakers before me, I very much welcome REACH, which should guarantee that the substances we use in daily life do not present risks to human health and the environment. The authorisation of a harmful substance must, in my view, be an essential stage in the regulation. How is the product used? How can it be identified? How can we prevent its use by an unsuspecting public? How, too, can we draw up a study plan with a view to the substitution of a dangerous substance? REACH must also extend knowledge on chemicals by forming a European database and stimulate innovation by encouraging the substitution of substances of concern. REACH will be a good regulation if, based on the knowledge and expertise of the chemical industries, it gives rise to new technologies, new substances and new businesses. We will have succeeded if we adopt a proportionate, simple, effective system that is practicable for business. We will have succeeded if, on Thursday, we adopt a balanced text that enables businesses to retain their leading position at a global level and that protects the health of people and the environment.

 Mr President, yet another business in the south-west of France has just announced that it intends to cease production. As a result, 54 textile workers specialised in the production of luxury cloth are at risk of long-term unemployment in an already devastated region. The situation we are experiencing is catastrophic. Large numbers of jobs have been lost in this sector since the start of 2005. The recommendations from the high-level group prepare for the future but what will happen in the short term? Commissioner, you say that we have a respite period of two and a half years, following the agreements that you have signed. However, we must act fast, and I would suggest a number of paths worth considering: authorise the Member States to use the Structural Funds reserve to assist businesses suffering cash-flow problems, and to help them to innovate and restructure; assist businesses in creating consortiums so that they can form a true commercial force able to conquer the Chinese market; impose social and environmental criteria; require product labelling that indicates the country of origin; and, finally, as the speakers before me have already said, create true European labels.

Mr President, the challenges of the wine market are huge. The United States remains a key market for the European Union with 60 million wine drinkers and an average level of consumption that has grown from 8 to 13 litres per inhabitant per year over the last ten years. Last year, the volume of the US market increased by 5.6%. France is ranked third among exporters to the United States, behind Italy and Australia. In this context, we must welcome the agreement on wines which has been made between the European Union and the United States and which concludes the first phase of negotiations that were begun 20 years ago. Using blackmail, the United States threatened to subject European exporters to an onerous certification procedure. This autumn’s Beaujolais nouveau, 
therefore, would have been first in line. It would have been subjected to additional analysis and certification checks. This agreement has also enabled progress to be made in the area of wine-making practices. European producers, however, consider these control standards to be insufficient. They oppose practices such as flavouring, which is aimed at infusing wine with the taste of fruits. The changing way in which we define wine is at stake. They also emphasise the protection of geographical designations. Commissioner, it is necessary, therefore, in the second phase of negotiation, to ensure that the commitments undertaken by the US authorities are observed: to cease using semi-generic terms, such as Burgundy, Chablis, Champagne and Port, and to improve the level of protection of geographical indications, as well as improving labelling. In this global wine market, which is often controlled by the large US wine traders, the type of vine has become a brand name. I am not against the globalisation of the wine market, but I am against copies. I am against the standardisation of flavour: I do not want a McDonalds-style Chardonnay wine. Wine goes hand-in-hand with cuisine; it is the mark of the region where it was produced, it carries the flavour of the cultivated soil and it is the symbol of festivity and of living together. The diversity of the designations reflects the diversity of the wines, our cultural diversity. Mutual recognition of the geographical indications, that is to say the designation of the soil from which the wine is produced, will contribute to preserving our respective cultural identities, to boosting our trade with the United States but, above all, to encouraging European wine growers who, for years, have constantly improved the quality of their production in order to satisfy our demands, and serve our enjoyment, as consumers.

 Mr President, the LIFE + environmental programme is crucial for supporting the implementation and development of environmental policy. It therefore has to act as a stimulus for implementation and as a catalyst for innovation and change, and thus enable action to be taken across the board at European level on the priority areas. Based on our successful experience with the current LIFE programme, LIFE + has to be the vehicle for assessing and monitoring conservation status, for drafting action plans on the recovery of species and for actions linked to the operation of the Natura 2000 European network. Demonstration projects concerning the establishment and protection of Natura 2000 should continue to be funded since they provide European added value. Environmental policy, however, amounts to more than just Natura 2000. That is why I am against Amendment 35, which proposes allocating 90% of the LIFE + programme to the funding of Natura 2000. LIFE + should actually adopt an approach that provides proportionate support for the four crucial subject areas in the Sixth Environmental Action Programme: climate change, the preservation of biodiversity, the environment and health, and the protection of natural resources. Finally, I should like to say that I share the rapporteur’s opinion that projects must continue to be selected at Community level to ensure that they provide European added value.

 Mr President, I sincerely welcome the outcome of the European Commission’s negotiations with the Chinese authorities. This will provide companies affected by the huge rise in imports with some respite in this extremely serious crisis for the textile and clothing sector. It is now necessary to monitor the implementation of the safeguard clauses and to evaluate the effects of these measures. I should like to put three questions to the Commissioner. How do you intend to respond to this resolution by the European Parliament on the future of the textile and clothing industries? How do you intend implementing the High Level Group’s recommendations, which have been received very favourably by Parliament? And what actions do you intend to take to enable companies to have access to the market? For example, might the European Union support trade strategies common to those small- and medium-sized European enterprises that might wish to form consortia with a view to conquering new markets such as China’s? Fellow Members have already said this, but the current crisis in the textile sector was foreseeable, and crises in other sectors of industry are foreseeable in the context of a globalised economy. We must all work with ingenuity and tenacity to safeguard the textile, clothing and leather industries, for the lessons we shall learn from this crisis will, in the long run, help us to maintain and develop other sectors of the European economy.

 Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his kind remarks. Ladies and gentlemen, let me also express my deepest gratitude to my fellow rapporteurs for their opinions, which have been in my mind throughout my considerations and which have made a considerable contribution to the report that I am presenting today. I would also like to thank the representatives of the European Commission and the representatives of the Council for their attention and for their answers to the many questions we have raised. Finally, my thanks go to the secretariat of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and to my assistant for the help that they have given me. Commissioner, you recalled the objectives of this proposal for a decision. They are to adapt the guidelines to the shape of the European Union of 25 Member States, to authorise the financing of common-interest projects, to make it possible to create an internal market for gas and electricity and, principally, to ensure that there is security of supply via interconnections between the Member States and with neighbouring countries: south-east Europe, the Mediterranean countries, Ukraine, Belarus. This approach to the trans-European energy networks corresponds, in fact, to the approach taken for the trans-European land transport networks. A majority of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy supports the new ideas introduced by the European Commission to define the action priorities, particularly the description of projects of European interest located on high-priority routes and the appointment of a European coordinator, provided, however, that this is limited to complex projects that present particularly difficult implementation conditions and that it occurs in consultation with the Member States. Parliament must also be consulted on the appointment of the coordinator, which is the aim of the amendment proposed by my group. The report voted for by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy encourages the Member States to cooperate amongst themselves when this is made necessary by the implementation of transnational enquiry procedures taking into account decisive criteria, such as security of supply, the project’s impact on the environment, the opinion of the inhabitants of the territory concerned, and so on. On the basis of information provided by the Council, the Committee on Industry felt that the Council’s recommended approach was consistent and made it possible to simplify the Commission’s original proposal. Thus, the report voted for by the Committee on Industry establishes a hierarchy of projects: common-interest projects that form the basis of the trans-European projects are listed in Annex III and priority projects described as projects of European interest are listed in Annex I. The Committee on Industry did not want to call into question the projects established by the Member States, because it felt that it did not have sufficient competence or information to assess the choice of projects. Nevertheless, following comments made by some of my fellow Members, I would like to ask the European Commission to verify the validity of the projects when this decision is applied. By way of example, our fellow Members from the Baltic States think that it would be more appropriate to have a gas transport network crossing the Baltic States to supply them, rather than an offshore network in the Baltic. As another example, the EHT line between France and Spain is giving rise to very forceful protests from the inhabitants of the region. That is why the financial package allocated to these projects should be increased to EUR 60 million, which would make it possible, for example, to respond better to environmental constraints, which may require more thorough feasibility studies. It is a matter of validating the projects, of coordinating the procedures for consultation between the Member States, of finding the most appropriate technical solutions. Before I finish, I would also like to stress the fact that the Committee on Industry views the inclusion of the transport of olefins in this text as justified not only in view of the importance of such networks in Europe for the European chemical industry, but also in view of the gains in terms of safety and the environment that would result from a reduction in road transport. Besides access to the European Investment Bank, the reference to olefin-related projects guarantees a symbolic European label. It does not, however, enable these projects to benefit from European subsidies under the budget for trans-European networks. I think it is also necessary to consider the integration of the trans-European energy networks into the European corridors that have been proposed for the land transport sector.

 Mr President, I welcome, as Mrs Schierhuber does in her report, the creation of a single fund to finance the rural development policy and stronger strategic guidelines. With regard to the allocation of funds for 2007-2013, I find it regrettable that the financial perspectives propose a reduction in resources. It is also regrettable that the proposal for a regulation no longer provides a period of grace for young farmers, as was the case during the 2000-2006 programme. That is why I support a return to the previous instrument. One solution, when compliance with standards requires investment, could be to allow a period of five years after setting up for this investment. During this period, young farmers could continue to benefit from investment aid and would not be penalised for failing to comply with the standards clearly identified in the agricultural development plan. Finally, as I am convinced that rural areas are becoming more and more attractive, I have presented some amendments that aim to make this regulation more favourable to rural development, particularly by adding impetus to its non-agricultural component, including craft trades and micro-enterprises.

 Mr President, my fellow Members have already pointed out that the consequences of lifting the quotas has been immediate, and the threat facing the European textile and clothing industry is indeed a real one. By way of example, I would also like to refer my own region, which has been seriously affected by the decline of the textile industry. The district of Castres-Mazamet acquired its industrial nature from the wool pulling and leather industry. For many years now, the SMEs in this sector have been closing down one after another. Some of them have been able to switch to other fields, thanks to skills developed in international trade, industrial technology and the development of new products. But do we have the right to write off those who want to ply their trade in textiles and clothing? Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, do we not have a duty to protect the European textile and clothing industry? Pending implementation of the High Level Group's recommendations, on which Parliament will state its position, the European Union has defined a strategy for coping with changes resulting from the end of quotas, which translates, it would seem, into specific commitments: producing a draft protocol on the rules of origin, adopting guidelines regarding the textiles-specific safeguard clause for China, putting in place the Community preference system, the likely establishment of a 10% threshold with the aim of preserving the market share of traditional providers of the EU, negotiating at the WTO in order to obtain substantial concessions from emerging countries that maintain high tariffs, as well as erecting non-customs barriers in the textiles and clothing sector and, finally, adopting strategic plans at local level to improve the allocation of public funds. I have in mind in particular funds from the flexibility reserve within the framework of the structural funds and of the 'regional competitiveness and employment' Objective. Within what timeframe and following what timetable are you planning to apply these specific measures?

Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your communication, and for having broadened our debate on the Thyssen situation into a debate on the steel industry in general. Following the restructuring measures and mergers within the industry, we are very concerned, for several reasons, by the loss of entire sections of the production structure in Europe. There is the chronic loss of jobs in the industry, the risk of losing technological know-how and the knock-on effects on other economic activities, such as vehicle manufacturing, aerospace, energy production and the construction industry. There are also consequences for research: how can we develop the new materials vital for the technology of tomorrow if our steel industry disappears? Accordingly, the European Union must have a duty and a right to intervene in the activities of the steel industry, by using public funds, where necessary, to support steel companies’ research and development activities, by monitoring public investments to ensure that they help to safeguard or develop employment and to modernise industrial plant and processes, by adopting a more resolute strategy on industrial restructuring and its social impact, by supporting moves to restructure the steel industry or to switch to manufacturing products with high added value, by creating favourable conditions, especially for cutting-edge, high-tech sectors, through the allocation of EU funds under the seventh framework R[amp]D programme Practice makes perfect or, as the French proverb says, forging makes a blacksmith. In short, we must keep forging if we are to keep our blacksmiths and steelworkers, and we must keep forging to acquire more know-how and invent the steels of tomorrow.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate and thank Mrs Estrela for her report and the quality of it. It is time for the Commission and Parliament to take up this issue. Measures are urgently needed to protect pregnant women and women who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding, and it is essential to ensure that their rights are respected. From this point of view, the report is well balanced: it deals with the regulation of night work; protection against dismissal; rights linked to social protection and employment contracts and the defence of such rights, in particular those concerning maternity pay. However, I do not agree with Mrs Estrela’s proposals on obligatory paternal leave and the length of maternity leave. It cannot be denied that motherhood is still a hindrance to young women’s careers. The very important part on mothers returning to work must therefore not be neglected. Maternity leave must not penalise women. Maternity leave that is too long will, inevitably, result in fewer chances for women to return to good conditions in the employment market. This is why the Commission’s proposal to set maternity leave at 18 weeks, and accompany it with realistic measures, is an excellent one, because it takes the situation of both workers and employers into account. If we want to fight discrimination and defend women’s rights, we need to ensure that women must not resign themselves to saying goodbye to their careers, that doing so remains an active lifestyle choice. We need to expose the hypocrisy of the idea of free choice, which is often a direct result of inequalities in the salaries of men and women and insufficient childcare facilities. I do not think that paternity leave has a place in this directive. However, if it must remain part of it, it must be more flexible. The vote in committee for the compromise of reducing paternity leave from four to two weeks is a step forward; but why should paternity leave be obligatory? I agree that fathers should have a role, but it should not become a poisoned chalice and, if we want the presence of both the father and the mother to benefit them and their baby, we need to preserve the notion of choice. Reconciling professional and family life is at the heart of the European social project and such an important cultural change should be freely agreed upon before it is approved.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as an artist, I am saddened, I am very shocked by the lack of interest shown in the cultural sector by Mr Lambrinidis’s report. I would stress that we should at all times safeguard and protect individuals’ rights as a whole, in accordance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and should guarantee the rights and freedoms of all parties concerned. The information society is an increasingly important economic sector, but also a major source of innovation and creativity that underpins the modern-day economy. This means, among other things, that access for all to a diverse culture and to education must be guaranteed within a context of respect for Community law and that the value of the creative work of authors and performers, including in the digital economy, must be duly recognised. However, such recognition means remunerating them for all the ways in which their creative contribution is used so that they can make a living from their profession and can be completely free to devote themselves to it. In this context, intellectual property rights must not be seen as an obstacle but indeed as a driver of creative activities, especially in the context of developing new on-line services. On the other hand, I believe that, even on the Internet, racist, hate-filled or revisionist discourse must be prosecuted. Freedom of expression must be exercised responsibly. The right balance must be struck between freedom of access to the Internet, respect for privacy and protection of intellectual property. I therefore call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to endorse my Amendments 2 to 6.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, careers in the performing arts are not immune from the continuing existence of major inequalities between men and women. As I have responsibilities in the arts, this is a subject close to my heart, as discrimination against women in the performing arts is still rife, particularly when it comes to senior positions: there are so few female directors in theatre, dance, opera and so on. For example, it is important to widen the practice of holding auditions behind a screen in recruiting orchestral musicians, by analogy with the existing business practice of viewing anonymous CVs, partly because it is the only way that women will get jobs as orchestral soloists and also because it is a good way of combating racial discrimination. Moreover, the balance between professional and family commitments is even more difficult for women in this sector, due to the unusual working hours connected with their profession, hence the need to have specific opening hours for crèches that meet the needs of artists. Ladies and gentlemen, Europe, as the ancestral home of culture, cannot continue to do nothing in the face of these problems that make it suffer.

 I wish to congratulate Mrs Hieronymi and Mr Guardans for their splendid dialogue with the Members and for the quality of the reports that they drew up with the Council which have led to the presentation of this extremely consensual report at second reading. The Council has accepted a large number of Parliament’s requests and all the requests of my political group. I am pleased that two items particularly dear to my heart were included in the text: the country of origin principle and the protection of children in relation to advertising messages. Parliament has shown that it was able to conduct negotiations with the Council, with these having produced a much more elaborate text than before. It was not an easy task, but we have achieved our aim. I now hope that transposition into national law will be facilitated by goodwill among our governments.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say that I have had great pleasure in drafting this report and that I am grateful to all my colleagues and all the shadow rapporteurs. This report was unanimously adopted by the Committee on Culture and Education on 7 May. I am tabling two new amendments today that I devised with eminent colleagues who have been ministers of culture. I would emphasise the fact that the measures that they contain will be submitted to the Member States in their definitive version only when we have the results of a study that I request in my report and that will be entrusted to the Commission. In the light of the elements that will subsequently be communicated to us, we will have an opportunity to analyse together the advantages and disadvantages of these measures and to take the most appropriate decision. I should like to say that I was very shocked when, yesterday, a lobbyist, whom I find pretentious, woke up – even though he had had my report for two months – and took the liberty of calling my colleagues to ask them to vote against these two amendments. I find this attitude unacceptable and I hope that all those who have supported me on the occasion of this report will not let themselves be influenced. As I see it, our honour as MEPs is at stake, and I hope that you will put your trust in the artist that I am and that you will support the two amendments that give hope to European artists.

There was a time when all humankind spoke one language and used the same words. However, according to the biblical account of the Tower of Babel, people tried to build a tower that could reach the sky and put them on an equal footing with God. To thwart this plan, God multiplied the number of languages so that people would no longer understand each other and would disperse across the Earth. With this report on multilingualism, Europe is implementing an ‘anti-Tower of Babel’ project, insofar as it intends to promote and develop minority languages. In order to gauge the importance of multilingualism, we really must understand what it is all about. Cultural and linguistic diversity means showing respect for cultural identity, traditions and religions. By promoting the integration of a European society in which there are many different types of knowledge, Europe is implicitly acknowledging that language learning is a crucial factor in people’s ability to communicate amongst themselves. Multilingualism is also an opportunity for the future, and it has become Europe’s duty to safeguard it for its citizens. Faced with globalisation, which encourages monolingualism, the more linguistic diversity is recognised, the less we will be able to fall back on our identities.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to start with I would like to congratulate Mr Graça Moura on the quality of his work and to thank him for the favourable attention he always paid to our proposals. His report is excellent, which is hardly surprising coming from this Portuguese writer who is such an ardent defender of the Portuguese language. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would urge Parliament to give him its full support. This programme covers the following objectives: promoting the transnational mobility of people working in the culture sector, encouraging the transnational circulation of works of art and cultural and artistic products, and promoting intercultural dialogue. That said, one wonders how, with such a limited budget, we will be able to safeguard and promote linguistic diversity and encourage language learning and the teaching of music and performing arts. One also wonders how this programme will be able to promote and develop the European Union's external visibility thanks to the promotion of its cultural diversity and of the aspects common to all its cultures. I am therefore very disappointed that the Commission has not understood the vital role that culture plays in our European identity, and I find it particularly serious that it felt able, on the basis of the interinstitutional agreement containing the financial perspective for 2007-2013, to approve such a tight budget, amounting to only EUR 354 million, compared to the 600 million called for by the rapporteur and the 408 million proposed by the Commission. The budget for the 'culture programme 2007' for the period 2007-2013 now represents just 0.04% of the European Union's budget granted in the financial perspective. All artists in Europe will be amazed that the European institutions still consider culture to be the icing on the cake, as a luxury that takes second place to necessities. If promoting culture involves raising awareness levels and curbing obfuscation, this shrunken budget is not the way for Europe to set an example.

Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly thank Mrs Prets for the work she has done, and I will be voting in favour of her report. The report sharply underlines our shortcomings with regard to combating the trade in, and trafficking of, women, adolescents and children. The laws in Europe on paedophilia, sex tourism and organised prostitution are in fact so diverse that we really need to show courage and determination in order to reach a consensus. We need to act quickly if we are to stop the growth in these sordid – indeed Mafia-like – markets and to combat the traffickers and their accomplices, who rely both on the prostitutes’ distress and on the clients’ sexual deprivation. I am not offended by the fact that prostitution exists, and I do not deny that it satisfies a great deal of its consumers, but I do, however, take a firm stance against this attack on a person’s integrity. I do not want to support a form of pseudo-morality that punishes the sins of the flesh but, at the same time, I do not want to accept a lax form of tolerance that disregards the Charter of Fundamental Rights, particularly in relation to a person’s integrity, freedom and dignity. We must not, of course, imagine that we are going to eradicate prostitution, but we must make a clear distinction between tolerance and legitimation. I am in favour of criminalising demand. It is our duty to reflect together on the implementation of in-depth laws to stop the growth in these markets and to thwart those who seek out, encourage and try to put in place these kinds of activities. It is, in any case, crucial to arrive at a zero tolerance approach where cases of paedophilia and sexual exploitation are concerned, but we must also succeed in using information campaigns to raise clients’ awareness and to give them a sense of responsibility. In actual fact, even if the client’s role in all of this is a pitiful one, I am convinced that it should not be swept under the carpet. I am aware that it will be a long and difficult fight, but I do not want to be a party to a ‘least worst’ policy by supporting a lax form of tolerance that mainly benefits the organised prostitution rings, which garner huge financial profits and which also facilitate money laundering operations. I will conclude by saying that I am opposed to people being encouraged in any way to cast blame and to inform on others anonymously.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Graça Moura on the Culture 2007 programme for the period 2007-2013 wholly fulfils the expectations of culture professionals. It is balanced, consistent and demanding. It attaches great importance to the content of the proposals, it prioritises cultural diversity and it is committed to the development of European citizenship. I thank Mr Graça Moura for his listening skills and for the quality of the dialogue that we have been able to establish. I too am particularly delighted that it was possible for the cultural industries to be recognised in a recital of this report. I personally took a tough stand in calling for them to be included in this programme, and even if this result still falls far short of the mark, the progress made is by no means insignificant and deserves to be pointed out. I will continue to defend the position whereby the cultural industries contribute to promoting European culture: they generate employment and give economic added value to the cultural sector. There is even less reason to neglect the cultural industries inasmuch as they are the ideal vehicle for developing European culture and for underpinning its diversity. There is, unfortunately, a fly in this particular ointment. None of my colleagues in the Committee on Culture and Education will dispute the fact, because if there is, in truth, one point on which we are unanimously in agreement, it is that of the budget. I deplore the fact that culture should still be considered by the Commission as a luxury, secondary to the most crucial requirements. Is it really the case that culture is nothing but a luxury and that it is only secondary to the most crucial requirements? Violence exists; it is aimed at destroying culture. One form of violence is to argue that culture is pointless. I am therefore profoundly shocked by the meagre sum in the budget package allocated to culture. However, there remains a glimmer of hope in my opinion, Commissioner. The Unesco Convention, which has just been approved by a huge majority a few days ago, is a great victory for Europe and demonstrates once again that, when Europe is united, it is strong. It is also a great victory for European culture. With its diversity finally recognised, it now remains for Europe to assert itself on the international stage. However, it will only be able to pursue its role of ambassador if you give it the financial resources to do so. I will conclude by simply saying to you, Commissioner, that it is up to you to act in order to obtain a decent and respectable budget for culture, one that does not remain below 1% of the overall budget.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to repeat what a special and important place the ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive occupies within European integration. Through the impact it has, it creates a strong and clear link between all Europeans; it remains one of the essential factors of intercultural dialogue and contributes to developing our European identity. Mr Weber’s report not only refers to the application of Articles 4 and 5, but also to issues such as the revision of the Directive itself or media pluralism. Through my amendments, I was particularly keen to encourage assistance to be given to Europe’s special character so that cultural diversity, freedom, pluralism and independence of the media remain the crucial components of Europe’s audiovisual model. I also attached great importance to prioritising qualitative methods of analysing cultural content when confronted by the offensive of private or commercial production companies on the European markets. It is therefore crucial, in my opinion, to develop the special European character of content by establishing a link with funding methods. This precise point did not need to be developed in this report but it will absolutely have to remain a priority objective during the overall revision of the directive. In actual fact, nothing can be truly effective as long as the Member States do not commit to continuing funding public service television and to justifying the use of funds to the European Union. Obviously, it is impossible to talk about revising this directive without addressing the delicate issue of advertising. With regard to the latter, I considered that its content and regulation ought to be clearly defined, in particular for advertising relating to alcohol, which has a harmful effect on children and vulnerable people. I would even consider it crucial to extend the Directive to all audiovisual services made available to the public. I therefore hope that the new Directive can lay down legislation that genuinely implements the application of the penalties provided for as regards quotas and advertising. To conclude, I therefore ask you to vote in favour of this very satisfactory report proposed by our fellow MEP, Mr Weber.

I am extremely pleased that all the amendments I had tabled have been supported and adopted both by my colleagues in the Committee on Culture and Education and by those from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe; I would like to thank them very warmly for their confidence. This recommendation will undoubtedly give new impetus to European film production and help to drive the development of cinema in the new Member States. I have followed the drawing up of this document very closely, which is of very special interest to us, the French, since we invented the cinema. The Lumière brothers, in Lyon, were the first to perfect the technique of cinema and they inspired its documentary strand. A few decades later, Georges Méliès invented the cinema of spectacle and of the imagination. All of the films by the Lumière brothers have been restored by the French Film Archive and have recently been released on DVD. This is why I am convinced that, in order to ensure that nothing is lost, we should emphasise the requirement for the original prints of films to be deposited with a European body and for a database to be created at the European Audiovisual Observatory. What a joy it would be to be able, in that way, to relive the magic moments of L’Arroseur Arrosé; that is what I had in mind when I was working on this Council recommendation. I would also like to stress the role played by film criticism, a French speciality whose writings have encouraged works to be preserved. I am thinking of André Bazin, François Truffaut and Henri Langlois. I am therefore entirely satisfied with this report, which I would ask you to support. Cinema deserves a heritage policy, in the same way as buildings, pictures or books. The same goes for preserving that heritage, piecing together that history and making the link between the past and the future.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the last conference, which was held in Beijing in 1995, clearly identified a number of factors in female poverty and recognised the gender-specific dimension in the way governments deal with poverty. The chain of events that lead to poverty is always the same: unemployment, sickness, humiliation and then social exclusion. It is a vicious circle where women are more vulnerable than men. Indeed, they are constantly in a situation of inequality relative to men, in all areas of society. The number of women living below the poverty line has risen by 50% since the 1970s, while that of men has grown by 30%. What is behind what sociologists call the feminisation of poverty? No one can deny that poverty is fertile ground for prostitution. Moreover, the AIDS virus spreads more quickly in environments where women are kept in a state of sexual slavery. Europe cannot be indifferent to all that. It must continue to play a shrewd and uncompromising role in ensuring that all the underlying causes of poverty are dealt with and that the most degrading of its consequences, the trafficking of women for profit in a parallel market which reduces them to nothing more than a commodity, is eliminated.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is quite simply in my capacity as a European woman that I would like to speak today on the issue of ‘Women on Waves’. Like the Socialist Group in the European Parliament (PSE Group), I wonder whether the Portuguese Government’s decision to prevent the Dutch ship from entering its territorial waters was a breach of international law. I also, however, view it as a ban on the provision of care to fellow European women. Although in my opinion the ‘Women on Waves’ campaign is conducted in a somewhat provocative manner, I still believe that it is fundamentally legitimate. The association’s campaign is concerned with two women’s rights which to my mind are indispensable: the right to health and the right to dignity, both of which are included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. In many Member States these rights have been defended for decades by women who fight to win governments over to their legitimate cause. This is also why I personally am shocked to find out that even today and within the European Parliament there is a movement of women trying to question the gains won over a long struggle. I am not here to reprimand those Member States which have chosen to restrict, prohibit or punish the practice of abortion, but I believe that the event of which I am speaking today should be an opportunity for these Member States to reopen the debate on this difficult issue. Women often have to take the serious decision to end a pregnancy on their own, and it is always a time of great distress. It is a choice which is never made casually, but in all conscience, and accusations of guilt or even criminal guilt are not the right response. Only dialogue and information will make it possible to move public opinion forward. Incidentally, repression is a godsend to illicit businesses which exploit ignorance and social weakness. This type of network should have no place in our Europe of freedoms. It is the duty of the European institutions to set an example in this field and to ensure that individual freedoms are respected. If the Commission fails to take a clear stance, it will be seen not just as a social injustice for these women, but as an unacceptable setback for their fundamental rights. I would like to add that the problem does not affect women alone. I find it a pity that there are so few men in our Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, and I would like to express my sincere thanks to those who have realised that we must unite to defend our ideas and to demonstrate our commitment. Our duty as Europeans is to use our judgment and compassion to help the women of our Member States confront their problems. This is why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE/ADLE Group) calls on the Council and the Commission to adopt a clear and democratic position. (Applause

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I wish to congratulate Mrs Neris on the work she has achieved on a technical issue that is particularly difficult for non-experts like us. The aim of the regulation proposed by the Commission is to achieve a harmonised legislative framework, whilst retaining flexibility and reducing administrative overheads and costs. I do not know if we have always met this specification, but at least we have tried, with the rapporteur and the others shadow rapporteurs, to facilitate the work for second reading, since the Council has been unable to arrive at a common position. I will not go into the details, but I will take advantage of the time that remains to describe the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe’s position on the CE label, one of the crucial points of this report. On this issue, the ALDE Group is in full agreement with the Commission and has always opposed the proliferation of national labels. We will therefore vote in favour of making the CE label exclusive, of simplifying the procedures for acquiring this label, and of facilitation for micro-enterprises.

 In the context of amending Directive 2006/42/EC of 17 May 2006 on machinery with regard to machinery for pesticide application, we would like to stress that since the European Parliament adopted the machinery directive in 2006, we are stressing that the European Commission should revise the tractor Directive in order to secure a coherent approach. In our opinion, tractors do not fall under the scope of the definition of machinery as laid down in the machinery directive. The existing tractors directive could and should therefore be replaced by a less complex regulation.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when Europe is facing difficulties, with rising doubts and declining enthusiasm, we are about to celebrate an undeniable success, the 40th anniversary of the Customs Union. Between 1968 and 2008, customs have served as an example of resourcefulness and adaptability. You may remember the closing of border controls between Member States in 1993. Customs authorities managed to redeploy their forces and to do so in a modern way. They have a complex role to play because they have to respond to global challenges. While ensuring that the European Union and its citizens are secure, while ensuring that the logistical chain is secure, they must also maintain the right balance between controls and facilitating legitimate trade with a view to improving Europe’s competitiveness. In order to succeed in their task, customs managed to readjust radically thanks to a new customs code that is both simpler and more far-reaching as a result of the new technologies that will provide them with a paperless administrative environment, and also as a result of cooperation. That cooperation, which underpins the customs union, must apply as much to international bodies such as the WTO and the WCO as to the new administrations and industries. The results of that cooperation are particularly evident in seizures of counterfeits. Unfortunately, there are limits to international cooperation and at present we can only deplore the US Congress’s unilateral decision on 100% scanning of container cargo in EU ports. Customs need our support in order to engage in realistic discussions. We must listen carefully to the initiatives that have been announced in the strategy for the future of customs union and be prepared to support any measure that will make them even more efficient, especially in combating counterfeiting and organised crime. (The President cut off the speaker.)

Madam President, I must, of course, begin by thanking the rapporteurs, Mr Stubb and Mr Brie, and especially Ms Schaldemose for her efficiency – that cheerful efficiency which I think we have all appreciated. On the committee’s behalf, I would also like to thank Mr McMillan, for making himself so unstintingly available, and the Slovenian Presidency for injecting the impetus required to get this package through at first reading. The ALDE group is satisfied with the compromise that has been reached because our concerns have been addressed – the main points being importers’ liability and the CE marking system. We are all concerned to have a sound market, with sound economic operators selling safe products. So the ALDE Group supports the provisions requiring importers to be more attentive to product marketing, by giving them a share of responsibility for it with all that that entails. In relation to the CE marking system, we are satisfied with the distinction between the provisions of the regulation and those of the decision. On a personal note, I am sorry that we have not yet entirely resolved the problem of affixing national marks. This is a recurring issue. You will remember that when we voted on adoption of the Machinery Directive in February 2006, we asked the European Commission for a statement to the effect that it would ‘clarify the conditions for the affixing of other markings in relation with the CE marking, whether national, European or private’. The Commission has done what it undertook to do, but we – the Members of the European Parliament – and the Member States have, I think, lacked the political will to take a clear-cut position on the issue. We can only regret our failure to do so, but I do welcome Mr Verheugen’s announcement that the matter is to be the subject of in-depth study, for that is certainly what we need. The ALDE Group will support this compromise in its current form and we welcome the work that has been done on the text.
 Janelly Fourtou,  
rapporteur
. – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, now that we have come to the end of three years of hard work I am delighted at what has been achieved in respect of the key points in this document. The customs union is one of the pillars of the European Union and an essential element in the functioning of the internal market. The present Community Customs Code, which was drawn up in the 1980s and adopted in the 1990s, is now outdated. Our customs services are faced with new challenges. In 2007 world trade totalled nearly 16 billion dollars, or 31% of global GDP, and the European Union alone accounted for 20% of the total volume of global imports and exports. The customs services are therefore responsible for maintaining the smooth flow of trade and the controls that are needed to provide for this, while at the same time ensuring that the safety and security of EU citizens is protected. If a satisfactory balance is to be reached the control methods used have to be modernised and the level of cooperation strengthened between the different services and economic operators. The Code also has to be adapted to other radical changes that have occurred in the international commercial environment, mainly resulting from the growing and irreversible recourse to IT and electronic data exchange technologies. This particular subject was also the focus of a report that was drawn up by my colleague Mr Heaton-Harris and adopted by Parliament last December. The first reading of the modernised customs code was adopted on 12 December 2006 and the German Presidency managed to secure a political agreement on 25 June 2007. Parliament adopted 51 amendments to the proposal at first reading, 34 of which, mostly of a substantive nature, were taken over fully or in part in the Council common position. The main subjects of disagreement were the status of authorised economic operator, the right to act as a customs representative, centralised customs clearance and comitology. The status of authorised economic operator, which is directly related to the events of 11 September, was introduced by the so-called ‘security amendment’ Regulation, whose aim was to offer greater facilities to operators and hence offset the new burdens they had to shoulder in order to cope with security-related aspects. Your rapporteur is satisfied that the concept developed by Parliament at first reading has been taken over; this involves drawing a distinction between two types of authorisation, namely ‘customs simplification’, on one hand, and ‘safety and security’, on the other. This pragmatic solution allows for the different needs of the economic operators. Turning to the subject of customs representatives, emotions have been running fairly high in those countries which have had a long history of this profession. While the Council has not adopted Parliament’s proposals to the letter, it has nevertheless proceeded from the premise that customs representatives and authorised economic operators should interact along the lines we desired. Your rapporteur believes that the Council has arrived at a good compromise. Moreover, this solution has been accepted by customs representatives associations, even though they have lost their monopoly in certain Member States. As far as centralised customs clearance is concerned, we have another novelty in that the Council has introduced a new Article 106, taking the view that it is more logical and transparent for all of the provisions of the Code related to this concept to be encompassed within a single article. Henceforth all economic operators may benefit from centralised clearance on the territory of any one Member State. In cases involving several Member States they have to satisfy the eligibility criteria for authorised economic operator status. Finally, of all the areas in which this document has made significant progress we can also be very pleased that we have broadened out the comitology process to cover 44 provisions of the modernised customs code. For this reason I am calling on Parliament to support the Council common position without amendment.

Mr President, I would like to thank all those who have spoken and all those who have contributed to the drafting of this report. Since Mr Medina Ortega has spoken about smuggling I cannot resist the urge to bring up the subject of counterfeiting. Between 1998 and 2004 the number of arrests for counterfeiting rose by 1 000%. This just goes to show that the controls currently in place need to be updated and a new approach adopted as far as the duties of customs officials are concerned. I also wish to pay tribute to the professionals themselves, who have displayed a real openness of mind, and I would like to say to them that I still feel a debt of gratitude towards them. This will no doubt answer the concerns voiced by Mrs McGuinness. As far as the implementing measures are concerned, I will do my best to encourage dialogue between the customs authorities and the Community institutions, including the Commission, with which there has always been a good measure of close and productive cooperation. I therefore call on you to support the common position and would conclude by thanking you all for your attention.

In the Lehne report on the legal protection of designs, I decided to support and lend my signature to an amendment proposing an eight-year transition period before complete liberalisation of intellectual property rights on component parts of complex products, such as motor vehicles, used for the purpose of restoring their original appearance. So far, impact studies have not shown any significant reduction in the consumer price of these parts in the Member States where the system has already been liberalised. I am also convinced that the European Union is undermining its own interests here. Other parts of the world are engaged in protecting their manufacturing by means of industrial property rights, and the European Union – while declaring its desire to protect consumers and to combat counterfeiting – is making the wrong choice. The issues at stake are economic balance in the automotive sector and the safety of European vehicle users.

 Madam President, Mr Verheugen, Mr Lütke Daldrup, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to congratulate our rapporteur and also to thank him because Mr Toubon has worked in a spirit of complete cooperation with all his colleagues. Consequently, we have always been informed of his positions and of the progress of the dossier after every discussion with the Commission and the Presidency of the Council. Mr Toubon has sought our opinion, providing us in good time with clear, precise notes, which have enabled us to make up our minds with full knowledge of the facts. At the time of the vote at first reading, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe took a stand against maintaining packaging sizes insofar as these mandatory categories did not exist in the 27 Member States and these obligations could hamper innovation and competition by limiting consumer choice. The ALDE Group has, however, come round to the Council common position and supports the idea of transitional periods for certain categories of product. On the other hand, the ALDE Group did not necessarily want a revision clause to be entered into the actual body of the directive, as it felt that the reference to this review clause in a recital sufficed. Recognising, however, the persuasive powers of the rapporteur, the ALDE Group will support him on this point as, I might add, it will support his amendments as a whole. Aside from this vote, however, may I express my regret that none of the institutions has taken up the idea of concordance tables, which appeared in Article 8 of the basic proposal. In accordance with the ‘Better lawmaking’ interinstitutional agreement, the Member States are in fact encouraged to establish for themselves and in the Community interest their own concordance tables between the directives and the transitional measures and, above all, to make them public. This point is particularly important for the ALDE Group, which is very committed to improving information for consumers and, beyond that, which is fighting for better information for European citizens.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ‘modernised Customs Code’, ‘paperless Customs’, ‘Customs 2013 programme’, these three reports that we are discussing in this session demonstrate the growing importance of customs and their role in the European Union’s desire for competitiveness and efficiency. These three reports are closely linked but, in the interests of greater clarity, I shall first present the modernised Customs Code and then move on to the Customs 2013 programme. The Customs Code – as you said, Mr Kovacs – dates from 1992. It was legitimate to modernise it in order to adapt it to the evolving range of tasks undertaken by Customs and the radical changes that have taken place in international trade. It is a matter of rationalising customs procedures by laying the foundations of customs clearance systems that are accessible and interoperable within the European Union. That is why this proposal is accompanied by a proposal for a decision on electronic customs, for which Mr Heaton-Harris is the rapporteur. The new Code includes 200 articles and we have concentrated on the principal points, or at least the most controversial points, that is, the customs representative, the authorised economic operator, centralised customs clearance and comitology. Article 11 is concerned with the customs representative. Until now, national legislation has made it possible to reserve the right of representation to a professional category. In the context of the Single Market and the electronic environment, however, there is no longer any grounds for this monopoly. Furthermore, some businesses are able to have an integrated service that takes care of customs formalities. The right to customs representation, therefore, must be open to all. Nonetheless, in many Member States, using a customs agent is traditional and remains very useful for small businesses. That is why, without wishing to retain a monopoly, the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection adopted an amendment that, among the criteria for the status of customs representative, provides for recognition of the existence of practical standards of competence or professional qualifications in order to satisfy those Member States for whom the abolition of this monopoly is difficult to accept. We have not yet found the ideal solution and this question will certainly be raised again at second reading because certain delegations within the Council are still expressing reservations and going so far as to demand regulated access to the profession. The authorised economic operator was introduced into the Customs Code by means of Regulation 648 of 13 April 2005, known as the ‘security regulation’. This statute is not yet properly in existence because the provisions for its implementation have just been adopted by the Commission. The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has introduced a clarification, making a clear distinction between the ‘customs simplification’ Authorised Economic Operator, and the ‘security and safety’ Authorised Economic Operator. Centralised customs clearance is a facilitation that, in principle, has been well received but the Member States are wondering about the collection of customs duties. The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has adopted a fairly radical position in demanding that electronic customs clearance operations should be free of charge and that customs-offices should be open 24 hours a day. Indeed, in the interests of fair competition between national customs authorities, the rule must apply to all. It is necessary, however, to ensure that there is harmonisation of the checking processes. Finally, the provisions in the proposal make constant reference to comitology. This procedure is necessary because reference needs to be made to experts to establish the provisions for implementation of the Code. In accordance with the new interinstitutional agreement of July 2006, certain provisions of the Code are subject to the new procedure for comitology with scrutiny. Therefore, having sought the opinion of the European Parliament’s legal service, we have adopted, in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, amendments that are aimed at adapting the comitology procedure corresponding to the different articles. The Committee on International Trade adopted amendments for the codecision procedure for certain provisions that would normally fall within their competence by virtue of the strengthened cooperation procedure. We considered, however, that its position was contrary to that of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and we had to reject those amendments. Those then, very briefly, are the main points of the report and, as I said just now, it is very closely linked with the report concerning the Customs 2013 programme. Reading the mid-term evaluation of the Customs 2007 programme has demonstrated that this programme is well adapted to the needs of administrations and that it plays a crucial role in helping participating countries to share their experiences. This evaluation recommended strengthening the activities carried out in the field of training and information exchange. The programme has a budget of EUR 322.8 million over a period of six years and its aim is to help the customs administrations of the participating countries to encourage legitimate exchanges, to simplify and speed up customs procedures and to ensure the safety and security of citizens and the financial interests of the Community. The amendments adopted in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection are in line with the work of the Council and I wish to thank the Finnish Presidency in particular because, in order to satisfy the European Parliament’s legitimate budgetary demands, it has on many occasions negotiated with Member States and defended our position. Therefore, we shall be able, I hope, to conclude this matter at first reading. The reports concerning customs are eminently technical and complicated. That is why I wish to thank most warmly the various people I have spoken to within the Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union who have always responded to my every request and allowed me to tackle these subjects more easily. I thank also my fellow Members and the Chairman of our Committee for their help and support. At a time when trade is speeding up, when organised crime and counterfeiting threaten our security and our market, customs and economic operators need our full support.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on machinery we are looking at today revises a directive, as you said, dating from 1998. It is a highly technical subject, but it will have a major impact on the European engineering industry and on the European economy as a whole. I would like to remind you of the figures that Mr Verheugen has already quoted, which, in fact, are even better than the ones I had. I cannot resist reminding you that the annual turnover in the sector is EUR 402 billion, of which EUR 113 billion a year comes from exports to third countries. The first reading reflected a reasonable compromise reached after years of debates. I well remember that simply laying down the definitions of machinery and partly completed machinery took considerable commitment during the previous mandate. During the second reading, for my part, I paid particular attention to the provisions of that directive relating to CE marking, as I felt that the wording was insufficiently clear in legal terms. I am grateful to the Council for having accepted my amendment, but I am delighted that the Commission is working on this subject, which still needs to be looked into more deeply. I would like to thank the rapporteur for the way he led the negotiations. We were able to make considerable progress towards a common position thanks to the informal three-way talks he arranged, bringing together the chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the shadow rapporteurs, the representatives of the European Commission and those of the Council. We have reached a consensus awaited by all those in the industry. There are still some points that need to be clarified, particularly with regard to tractors, but I remain optimistic and I hope that the problems will be resolved by the effective implementation of this directive. As a consequence of this, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will vote for the compromise.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over many years, the mild climate, the beautiful countryside, the low prices and the warmth and friendliness of the locals have encouraged thousands of Europeans to buy property in the Spanish region of Valencia. In response to soaring demand and in order to discourage speculation, the Autonomous Government of Valencia adopted a land development law called the Ley reguladora de la actividad urbanística
 (LRAU) in 1994. The European Parliament has since received thousands of petitions against the application of precisely that law. The petitioners are complaining about improper encroachment, as they see it, on their property rights by urban amenity and land development projects. The criticisms relate both to the substance – legal, economic and environmental legitimacy of such projects – and to the form – poor information, lack of transparency, excessively short deadlines for lodging challenges and proposals, and too low a level of compensation. They feel powerless in the face of a situation that is highly complex, since it should be remembered that legal and political responsibility in this area is shared between the Spanish Government as regards land law, the autonomous community of Valencia as regards local legislation concerning planning rules, and the municipalities which, on the basis of both Spanish and regional legislation, implement the programmes which they deem legitimate. In order to familiarise itself with the situation on the ground, the Committee on Petitions sent two delegations, one in 2004 and one in 2005, to gather information from the various parties involved. As rapporteur, I was in the second delegation, and I was very impressed by the number of petitioners and found not only what they said but also their trust in Europe’s response very moving. I also valued the attention paid to us by the Valencian authorities and their willingness to cooperate. The Community of Valencia is aware of the problems, and is currently in the process of drafting a new law, called the Ley Urbanística Valenciana
 (LUV), which will address the complaints raised by the petitioners. In a spirit of openness, the Valencian Government has also invited the European Parliament to put forward any suggestions it considers necessary. Europe is often criticised for being remote from its citizens, and this is a good opportunity to show the opposite: the European Parliament, via its Committee on Petitions, is listening to the citizens. The problem, however, is that we cannot overstep our authority because we absolutely cannot give the citizens false hopes that will inevitably be dashed. With regard to the facts and Community competence, we therefore call on the European Commission to continue to ensure that the tendering procedure is followed and to monitor any breaches of the environmental directives. It already started to respond to our calls on 21 March, by opening infringement proceedings against the Kingdom of Spain for failure to comply with the directive on public procurement. We have insisted to the regional government and to the municipalities that they should provide everyone affected by the LRAU with assistance enabling them to plan a possible process of rectification and compensation. We are calling for the environmental issues so crucial to the future of Europe to be taken into account in all projects. I would like to thank my fellow Members who have shown such enthusiasm for this subject and who have improved my initial report, but I would remind them that we can only act within the bounds of our Community competences and that we have little room for manœuvre. Our response depends, and has depended, on our temperaments and on our commitments. Some tend to do a great deal, others not enough; I myself have tried to strike a happy medium, and it is in that spirit that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will table some amendments intended purely to refocus our efforts. I am tempted to tell the European citizens affected by the LRAU that we have heard them, that we are appalled by the situation and that we are here not to judge, but to try to bring pressure to bear to ensure that they are all listened to and respected, and that, in the end, a fair and balanced solution will be found. I hope that this report will be successful, that the situation will ultimately be made fair for everyone and that the Committee on Petitions will once again be able to show that we are an important link in the chain of the relationship between the citizens and the European Parliament.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Savary, ladies and gentlemen, we are here in a parliamentary assembly that is made for voting on texts, Commissioner, and we are above all in a parliamentary assembly so that texts are implemented. We note today that, after the excellent work carried out by your predecessor with regard to the Green Paper and to the 400-odd contributions that have followed it, work has barely moved on, to the extent that, as you yourself repeated just now, it was interesting that the European Parliament should have expressed an opinion. Indeed, nature abhors a vacuum, so when the European Commission does not do its job, it is Parliament that has to do it, and, in that respect, I must say – and you have said it too, Commissioner – that the work done by Mr Savary is very interesting since, in fact, he has provided you with all the material needed to draft the action plan. I do not mean that a role reversal is taking place between the Commission and Parliament, but we should note that, while the Treaty of Lisbon has yet to be adopted, Parliament is in fact seizing a little more power. This work by Mr Savary is excellent because it takes account once again of a number of proposals by the Committee on Regional Development. While respecting the principle of subsidiarity, of course, we expect you to present us with a guide. The latter will be useful. Its aim will not be to constrain local authorities, but rather to help them. We expect you to present us with indicators – again, not as a constraint, but as a support. Above all we also expect you to present us with the travel plan-related elements. In certain countries, these exist; in certain countries, they are even mandatory, they are absolutely vital. I should like to give an example. At the Urban Housing Intergroup, which I have the honour of chairing, we have highlighted urban growth over the last few years: in 10 years, urban growth has covered three times the surface of Luxembourg. So, how is that linked to our debate this evening? It has a very direct link since city-based users travel exactly 20% more each day due to urban growth, and more than 70% use their own cars. All of this is a means of saying that, when the Committee on Regional Development asks you to observe the condition not only of the integrated approach but also of the travel plans, it is establishing a general principle that we very much hope you will take into account in your action plan. This issue has obviously already been raised within our Urban Housing Intergroup, and we would like to express our gratitude to you in advance for taking account of the integrated approach here too. You have not answered our questions today, Commissioner. You have made what is, in a way, a half-hearted commitment; you have been quite firm on the principle, but you have not provided us with any guarantees. The situation is in fact serious. Why? 400 million Europeans live in cities, and those 400 million Europeans are affected by living conditions such as this that cause them to waste time every day in traffic jams. We know that these traffic jams cost us 1% of GDP. At the same time as we are talking about a recovery plan – an economic recovery plan – we are letting billions of euro go to waste. Swifter action is required, Commissioner, for these action plans on urban mobility are a crucial element of the recovery plan, but they are also crucial in terms of the climate-change challenge since, as you pointed out, 40% of pollution is found in cities. I should not like to ignore the safety aspect, either, since two out of three road accidents occur in cities. When we know that one death costs nearly EUR 1 million, and one case of serious injuries more than EUR 1 million, you see the economic cost and the human cost that this challenge of urban mobility represents each year. Thus, for all of these practical reasons, on the eve of the European elections, we are asking you, Commissioner, if possible during the conclusion of this evening’s debate, to go further in your proposals and in your promises, not by making general promises, but by committing to an action plan – your action plan – so that our fellow citizens will be more inclined to vote on 7 June.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and I shall of course vote in favour of these three reports. We shall vote for them not because they are totally satisfactory – as my colleagues said, we would have liked to have tabled a number of amendments – but because swift action is required. Mrs Krehl made this point just now. Forgive me for wondering though, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, whether we simply do not have a clue. We are here in comfortably heated and well lit surroundings. Do you know that, right now in Europe, there are 30 million homes with leaking roofs and damp in the walls? Of course, with the 4% from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) we are going to be able to remedy this situation for around 1 million homes. This work, if we oversee it, Commissioner – as I am going to put a request to you in a moment – will create 250 000 jobs and improve the situation in 1 million homes. This will save 40 million tonnes of CO2
 and reduce the energy bill of each family by EUR 450 per year. Those are the figures that I place at your disposal and that have been finalised by an important European organisation known in particular for its serious approach. This therefore means that the importance of the decision that we are going to take not only to guarantee a recovery but also for the well-being of our fellow citizens, comes down to one major condition: that the decisions taken by Parliament today, in concert with the Commission, take practical effect in the coming weeks and months. Commissioner, we listened to you carefully just now. You told us – and we believe you – that, by 30 June 2010, you will have asked each Member State to submit a report to the Commission. I and my colleagues, of all political persuasions, from the Committee on Regional Development are game for a bet. In all the countries, the operational programmes have just been adopted, and we know that the majority of the management authorities in these countries will not want them to be changed. In 15 months’ time, on 30 June, Commissioner, do not employ too many staff to draft the reports, the analysis of what will be done, as you will not achieve a great deal if you wait for the Member States, the management authorities and partners to set to work. We therefore have EUR 8 billion available on the one hand, and 30 million particularly deficient houses on the other. What needs to be done? Commissioner, I along with my colleagues am going to make a proposal to you along these lines. The European Commission should go beyond its rights and act firmly – I was almost going to say violently – towards the governments and the management authorities to instruct them to apply these provisions as quickly as possible. MEPs love voting for texts. That is our job. However, we especially love it when these texts are applied. We need the Commission, we hope that the Commission will listen to us.

Mr President, I extend a very affectionate welcome to your parents, who are present here today. I should have liked mine to have been here too, but that is no longer possible. We have just adopted the Lehtinen report. This is a crucial step in terms of our legislative arrangements, and I sincerely hope that the Commission will listen to Parliament in their regard. Indeed, we are well aware that, across the world, the development of techniques and organisations involves a growing number of subcontractors. That being said, the employees of our businesses must be better protected, and subcontracting businesses themselves must be on an equal footing, so that we have an economy that works in natural harmony. Therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I sincerely hope that the Commission and the competent services in each Member State will implement our own-initiative report as soon as possible, in order, I repeat, to better satisfy employees, on the one hand, and the balance between subcontracting businesses, on the other.

 Madam President, Mrs Hübner, over the last 30 years we have witnessed the benefits of the different cohesion policies we have pursued. We must emphasise these benefits during the upcoming elections, since they are of clear interest to citizens who have seen their quality of life triple in some cases, and for regions that, after having been in debt, are now making real headway. So then, the benefits cannot be denied. Today, moreover, cohesion policy has taken first place as the biggest item in our European budget. The issue posed by these six reports before us this morning, what we want to achieve as MEPs, is to improve the effectiveness of these funds and regulations that we are making available to our fellow citizens. Mrs Hübner, the Commission holds the key to the effectiveness of these provisions and budgets. How so? Firstly, if I may, Commissioner, because we have a relationship and we know that you will listen to us and ensure that the Commission takes due account of the requests made in these six reports, and I would take this opportunity to congratulate the six Members who drafted them. Mrs Hübner, these reports provide extremely detailed solutions, whether in terms of the urban environment, rural areas, best practices or future cohesion policy; as you know, they contain very specific examples that will facilitate the Commission’s work. We therefore await the Commission’s proposals for specific, European-level solutions, but that is only half the work needed to achieve effectiveness. That is why, Commissioner, we are also asking you to use as much influence as you can at governmental, regional and local-authority level, since these bodies will put into practice our provisions, budgets and regulations, and we will not be effective unless they are. We are counting on you, Mrs Hübner, both at European and national level, to make a success of the six reports we are presenting.

Mr President, one of our fellow Members has just spoken about the issue of intergroups. There are more than 20 intergroups within this Parliament and their work has been obvious throughout the course of this term of office, which is about to end. Countless dozens of texts have benefited from the work of our intergroups; there are tens of thousands of people, Mr President, and hundreds of institutions who have been received in Parliament thanks to the work of the intergroups. If we continue to oppress the intergroups by refusing to give them meeting rooms, there will be more demonstrations. Mr President, you have a great deal of experience, a very great deal of experience of our Parliament. Do not allow more or less secret sub-groups to meet during the next parliamentary term. We are not afraid of transparency at intergroup level, which is why we are urging you to make an assessment, quite openly, of the intergroups during this term of office. In this way we will have proof of their usefulness. Mr President, I beg you, do not remain deaf to the demands of the intergroups and to all the letters that have been addressed to you over recent years.

This own-initiative report should be viewed from the perspective of the legislative debate under way aimed at amending the regulations relating to the Structural Funds and, in particular, the ERDF regulation (Angelakas report) and the ESF regulation (Jöns report). In an effort to reach an agreement at first reading and give a rapid response to this crisis, which directly affects the people of Europe, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has chosen not to amend the legislative proposals. For the sake of consistency, this same approach has been applied for this vote. My colleagues from the MoDem party and I share the same concerns regarding the fight against climate change. The latter will have to be confirmed as a priority of cohesion policy after 2013.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like of course to add my compliments to Mrs Herczog for the excellent 90-point report on the Small Business Act. However, Commissioner, the work of the European Parliament will only be truly effective with quick and effective implementation in each of our States. You said in your opening remarks, Commissioner, that on the basis of this report, you were going to create a global strategy, but you will not be unaware that there is currently a financial crisis, an economic crisis and a climate crisis which require fast answers from us. I will take two examples. First example: I call for companies to be paid within 30 days. That is included in Point 87 regarding the Cohesion Fund. I call on the Commission and the Member States to take measures so that all public contracts are settled with the companies at 30 days. When it is known, moreover, that 20% of petitions for bankruptcy are due to delays in payment by public authorities, we can see how far this action by governments and the Commission would reduce the level of unemployment, which is growing daily. Second example: red tape. In Point 72, we call for red tape to be cut by at least 25%. I can tell you that I, as a company director, have been waiting for such a concrete measure for years. Company directors are not there to fill in forms the whole day long. They are there to provide products and services to our fellow citizens. If you heed this call, Commissioner, not only over and above the global strategy that you wish to create, but also in terms of the practical response of the governments and the Commission, then, within the framework of the current recovery plans, there will be provisions that deliver solutions to our fellow citizens straight away.

 Madam President, Mrs Vassiliou, on 18 November last year, I said the following in this very place: ‘we do not know what the next disaster will be or on what scale it will be, but we are sure of one thing, and that is that there will soon be another disaster again. When that time comes, our fellow citizens, who for 50 years have been used to seeing a supposedly united Europe being built, will turn round and ask us: “what have you done?”’. I repeat, I said that here, to this House, last November. In this same Chamber, in November 2006, two years before, I said more or less the same thing: ‘if there is one area in which all Europeans expect effective Community responses, it is that of large-scale natural disasters’. I said that everyone could see this whenever disasters such as the tsunami occur, and continued: ‘that is why, together with my group, I am in favour of implementing preventative actions and of putting in place the capacity to respond very quickly to the consequences of tragedies. In this connection, I should like to draw attention to the quality of the Barnier report, which states the problem well and proposes solutions that are constructive not only in terms of efficiency but also of subsidiarity’. Mrs Vassiliou, we have all remained enthusiastic about this report as it contains highly practical and concrete proposals. It even contains budgetary items and explains that 10% of the Solidarity Fund can provide funding. It explains in a most pragmatic way how to work with the stakeholders in each state. With the twelve proposals contained in the Barnier report, we had everything necessary to take action at European level which, a few weeks prior to the elections this coming June, would have provided an additional indication of the usefulness and effectiveness of true European operational solidarity. You have just told us, Mrs Vassiliou, that you hope to receive Parliament’s support. You had this support, and continue to do so. What is the Council doing, since you say that it is the Council which is the issue? The Council is not here this evening. We hope that over and above this debate, it will listen attentively to our call, which is not a call for help, nor another expression of surprise at the recent tragedy, but a call for it to clearly hear the question which I recently asked: ‘what have you done?’.
 Jean Marie Beaupuy,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group. – (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, with all due respect to your position and to you personally, Commissioner, I should like, if I may, to say two things in response to your speech. You have tried to sidestep the issue and you have done a balancing act. You have pointed out to us what the various chapters that were due to appear in this action plan were, and I believe that my fellow Members and I can only be pleased to have actually found the bulk of our proposals in this list. You have therefore furnished us with proof that, within the Commission, you possess all the elements needed to publish this action plan in all its parts. For my part I believe that there could be four explanations to account for your first sentence of part two, which says, if I have correctly understood the translation, that the conditions are not favourable. Possibility number one: is there a shortage of technical information within the Directorate-General for Transport? The particulars provided by Mr Barrot, within the context of the Green Paper, seem to suggest that, on the contrary, the Commission is very well equipped with technical information. Possibility number two: you say that the conditions are not favourable. Are some Member States opposed to this plan? As far as I know, though, Commissioner, the Commission is independent of the Member States. I do not for one second believe that you would have bowed to the pressure of certain Member States. Possibility number three: are there differences of opinion within the Commission itself that would prevent you from submitting this action plan to us? My goodness, I hope not! Lastly, are you refusing to hold the debate with the current European Parliament so as to postpone it until next year? Given the excellent reports that bolstered our relations with Vice-President Barrot during the drafting of the Green Paper, I dare not believe this. Commissioner, we are a few weeks away from the elections. This action plan is in my view an excellent example with which to demonstrate to our fellow citizens that, at the same time as it shows respect for subsidiarity, Europe is very in touch with their health problems, and so on, which you have listed. I deeply regret this delay and, like my fellow Members, I hope that you will be able to remedy it as soon as possible.

 Mr President, Commissioner, many of my fellow Members have pointed out, even just now, the inadequate take-up of budgets, particularly where the Structural Funds are concerned. It is therefore essential that we remedy this situation by taking appropriate, practical measures. I am delighted to see included in this budget the amount of EUR 2 million for the Erasmus pilot project for local and regional elected officials, a project which I personally proposed several months ago. Indeed, this inclusion in the budget follows on from the specific proposals in my report on governance, which was adopted last October, and by a very large majority in this House. In order to implement our regional development policies effectively, it is not enough to adopt regulations and budgets. It is vital that elected officials who manage local and regional projects can become real engines for achieving the objectives of Lisbon and Gothenburg, by using their knowledge. With this Erasmus scheme for local and regional elected officials, we can both strengthen human links and, above all, provide the means for more rapid and more effective use of the Structural Funds. Many associations of elected officials have already informed me that they are enthusiastic about this Erasmus scheme for local elected officials. Furthermore, with the support of the Directorate-General for Regional Policy, we will be able to launch this new instrument and thereby apply the slogan: ‘Think global, act local’.

With regard to the Sacconi report on emission performance standards for new passenger cars, I voted against the presented proposal in order to express publicly my regret that we have not reached an agreement that is more favourable to the environment. Nonetheless, I would like the positive vote that was expressed by the majority of Members to enable us to make an initial series of responses quickly, then, over the coming years, guide us towards decisions that reconcile the needs of our planet and of our economy, particularly taking account of the situation in the automotive industry.

Mr President, Commissioner, as my fellow Member, Mr Olbrycht, just said, this is a simplification first – we hope so, at least. It is without doubt the run-up to Christmas that is inspiring us to make this progress, to offer this gift to Europeans. However, as Mr Olbrycht just said, we hope, above all, that this gift is not the only one of its kind and, next March, we will have to give our verdict on the recovery plan so that, in the face of the financial crisis, we have more productive initiatives with which to look forward to a Europe-wide recovery. Within these drafts that we shall have to vote on in March, we are convinced that the Commission will propose new simplification tools to us, particularly regarding our ‘small-scale players’, regarding our SMEs. This is absolutely vital since, if the policies that we are debating and that we have been working on for months and years are to be genuinely effective, then this will, this dynamic that we want, must not be thwarted by any discouraging administrative aspects. Commissioner, you emphasised just now this good work that has been done with Parliament’s Committee on Regional Development, in particular. You know that we, the other Members of this House, are very keen to work with the Commission. That is why I would stress, once again, that we are hopeful of making very firm progress towards new simplifications during the coming year. However, the work that we are doing aside, it is our wish, at European level, that – through you, at the Commission, in particular – the Member States assume their share of the responsibility. We all know that, at the level of the ERDF and ESF Funds, and of the CAP Fund and so on, it is the Member States that add further complexities to our own European administrative complexities. Through our action and through our debate this evening, we hope not only that the European Union’s initiative will be acted upon at EU level, but also that, at Member State level, we are heard and that they too make a clear effort to simplify.

Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to take my turn in thanking the Court of Auditors for its excellent work. There have been a number of Members who, at this very moment, have rebelled against the general use of European funds. I would like to say that I hope that, when they report our debates and the results of the work of the Court of Auditors, the media will not do what they usually do and talk about the trains which arrived late and say nothing about the trains which arrived on time, because most of the budget of the European Union has been spent advisedly. We must not confuse the wood with the trees. Having said which, we have noted that the trend in this report by the Court of Auditors has been one of improvement. That is very good news. You also said that there are millions of beneficiaries, which alone illustrates the difficulty and scope of the task. For my part, I wish to underline two responsibilities. I do not wish to point the finger of accusation at any specific organisation. I simply wish to say that if, in future, we want to do better, those with material responsibility in the matter need to act. As I see it, there are two categories of people responsible. There is the Commission – and the Court of Auditors has just told us, having said that there are several million beneficiaries, that the first thing to be done upstream is to simplify the rules. We therefore expect, before talking about controls, before talking about a declaration, that things will indeed be simplified upstream for these beneficiaries – especially associations, individuals and so forth. The second category of people responsible is, of course, the Member States. I and my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Development shall not stop pointing to the responsibility of the Member States under the Structural Funds. It is they who often add to the administrative complexity and, instead of acting as councils, they complicate matters and sit in judgment. Therefore, over and above this Court of Auditors report, we really expect each of the Member States to facilitate access to European funds and, of course, to introduce more adequate controls over coming years.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in 2009, as we all know, there will be European elections. The year 2009 will also see the appointment of a new Commission. In 2009, there will, of course, be changes of presidency. However, the importance of all these things is only relative. Life goes on, and our citizens expect our institutions to respond to their concerns, always with an eye to the future, pursuing long-term objectives and able to initiate immediate action to achieve them. In this spirit, I wish to emphasise two fundamental areas of action for 2009. The first, which has been mentioned by every speaker, is to respond to the financial crisis. I certainly noted, as every one of us did, the gold stars that the Commission and the Presidency were awarding themselves. I would go so far as to say, Commissioner, that we can celebrate having scored the first goal, but the match is not over. As a result, if I may make a suggestion, the Presidency and the Council should get a move on and strike while the iron is hot so as to ensure that the 27 Member States come up quickly with effective responses to the financial crisis. As is often said, however, one crisis invariably conceals another; unless we wish to be taken unawares by the next crisis too, the programme for 2009 must be able, as President Barroso seemed to indicate that it will be, to respond to the challenges confronting us. As my colleague Mrs Wallis has said, this is why we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are making a number of proposals. Some of my colleagues will be speaking about some of these proposals. I should like to emphasise one of the points that I consider essential and on which we intend to focus sharply, namely the need to ensure that, in 2009, your Commission takes full account of the Structural Funds, which currently make up 36% of our budget and which will enable us to take far more effective action, to engender solidarity between our regions and to avail ourselves of the instruments without which we cannot meet the challenges of our age. Lastly, as winter sets in, let us not forget the housing crisis. We are counting on you to take action in this domain, Commissioner, particularly in response to our two requests for studies on the housing problem.
 Jean Marie Beaupuy,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group. – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, my fellow Members have already cited some examples. I should like to refer to some of them in order to introduce this subject, since we need to combat natural disasters. Who remembers what took place just a century ago, in 1908, in Messina, where 100 000 people died? Everyone obviously remembers Chernobyl, but if we focus on the last 10 years or so, there were the storms and the sinkings of 1999, the floods in Central Europe already cited just now, not to mention 11 September in New York, the terrorist attacks of March 2004, the problematic disease, chikungunya, and so on. We do not know what the next disaster will be or on what scale it will be, but we are sure of one thing, and that is that there will soon be another disaster again. When that time comes, our fellow citizens, who for 50 years have been used to seeing a supposedly united Europe being built – and a number of reports on which we have voted this week are testimony to this – will turn round and ask us the same question that they have been asking us regarding the current financial crisis: ‘but what have you done?’ Over the past few weeks some of you may have heard the former director of the International Monetary Fund explain in a previous report, from three or four years ago: ‘We said at the IMF that the crisis was going to happen, and we explained how to prevent it’. So, Commissioner, this evening you have come to listen to us, and we hope that you will be able to hear us and to ensure that, unlike what is happening with regard to the current financial crisis, Europe will not be behind if a disaster occurs. For my part I should like to make a twin proposal. Firstly, a proposal concerning the type of action to take. You said this in your closing remarks, Commissioner, you referred to the report by Michel Barnier. We cannot have two separate actions, even though you yourself, like each of us, in particular within the Committee on Regional Development, are forever saying that we need integrated approaches. We cannot have development of the Solidarity Fund, on the one hand, and a prevention policy, on the other. The two should be linked, not least in order to convince these infamous ministers of finance, who explain to us that perhaps even if the Solidarity Fund criteria were adapted – and you spoke about this – it would cost more. They should draw inspiration from the Barnier report and they would understand that if, at the same time, we conducted a prevention policy by pooling the means of action and pooling accident and natural disaster prevention, then, we would save money. Therefore, it is clearly a question not only of saving money and averting disasters, but above all of saving human lives – that really is the priority. That is why, Commissioner, I, along with all my fellow Members, urge you to do your utmost to ensure that, at the end of the French Presidency and during the Czech Presidency, you obtain a genuine guarantee from the Swedish Presidency that the action plan will not just be studied, but launched. We are counting on your determination. We need it. You know that Parliament is behind you – this evening it has said so loud and clear. We shall now wait to receive results for a year’s time, without fail.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must tell you that I had an enormous amount of pleasure in applying, myself, the principles of governance during the preparation of this report with the various stakeholders. Additionally, this method of working demonstrated its value in the preparation of the report, because it enabled me to take into account almost all the proposals made by my fellow Members, and on 9 September that was reflected in a unanimous vote within the Committee on Regional Development. This consensus would, however, be worthless had it not found concrete form in a text that is both specific and consistent, as I will demonstrate to you in a moment. I would therefore like to give my very hearty thanks to all my fellow Members who participated in this report, and in particular to the shadow rapporteurs, who would very much have liked to have been here this evening to display their commitment. Commissioner, all my thanks go, of course, to the Commission departments, and I would be grateful to you if you would pass them on, since this cooperation has been both constructive and pleasant. I will also thank the European Economic and Social Committee and its rapporteur, Mr van Iersel, the Committee of the Regions, Mr Kisyov, and the many bodies that have played a part. So, what are governance and partnership about? Well, we need to draw up an own-initiative report on this issue of governance and partnership because 'governance' and 'partnership' are terms that are used every day. You only have to pick up the newspapers or reports and you will always come across those words. Commissioner, there is a time for words and there is a time for action. There is a time for setting targets and there is a time for giving oneself the means to achieve them. For some years now we have been hearing the constant refrain that governance must be improved. It is incorporated into our regulations, it is discussed in our debates, but not much progress is made. What is really happening, when we see that the integrated approach appears in the many reports issued by the Commission and Parliament? Do our European policies on transport, the environment and regional development really take account of one another? Where is the integrated approach that we are hoping to see? Each policy has its own budget, its own minister, its own Commissioner and its own timetable. We can also see, just in relation to the Structural Funds, that the ERDF, the ESF and the EAFRD are applied on the ground separately. Commissioner, in carrying out your duties, with your colleagues, you know that we all consider it very important to attain the Lisbon objectives. If we go on in this way, though, with such a compartmentalised approach on the ground, do you believe that this will be possible? Do you believe that an organisation, regardless of how powerful and how determined it is, can succeed by allowing this 'each for himself' approach to be adopted on the ground? Today, the time has come for the various private and public stakeholders to bring together our skills and to bring together our budgets and our timetables when we are involved in the same subject in the same geographical area. My report puts forward 37 specific actions intended to achieve this, but I am not going to list them, I am just going to indicate three key points. The first key point is to give the various stakeholders, whether private, public, individuals or organisations, the means to implement this governance. The first point, and I stressed this to your colleague, Mrs Danuta Hübner, is to develop a practical guide to governance. No longer are we talking about abstract messages – this must be a practical guide. The second point is the training of elected representatives within the framework of an Erasmus programme. Our local and regional elected representatives should be the real engines for change in this new governance of the territories. In addition – and this is the second key point – our European and national institutions must set an example. That is why I call in my report for an annual meeting of the ministers responsible for cohesion policies within the Council. Commissioner, as you know yourself, there are also differences between the Commissioners and the various directorates-general. We need to have more effective inter-departmental work. As for the Committee of the Regions, it has anticipated my request because two weeks ago it responded to our proposals. Thirdly, it will of course be necessary, Commissioner, to have binding procedures. Since my time has run out, I will not be able to go into them in more detail, but please note that we expect the Commission to act now as the spearhead for this revolution in current practices. We must move on from words to actions. I and my fellow Members who have worked on these texts expect the Commission to take decisions that are both swift and effective.

Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissioner said that she herself wanted a Europe that was more visible, that meant something to citizens. Now, the largest budget item today, accounting for 36% of the Union’s budget, is concerned with cohesion policy. If there is one area in which our fellow citizens can see the practical and tangible effects of Europe’s achievements and determination, it is the Cohesion Fund. As has already been stated, 2009 will be a significant year, as we shall see the formation of a newly elected Parliament and Commission. This means that it will be a ‘blank’ year, a year off in certain areas. However, in terms of cohesion policy, we cannot afford to take any time off. We cannot stop the programmes that are under way and, above all, we cannot stop their effectiveness. Everyone here will surely have in mind the improvements brought to the daily life of people of Portugal, Spain, Ireland and all the countries of Europe thanks to our cohesion policies. The Commission must therefore be able to present to us a detailed work programme for 2009 as regards cohesion, which is, I repeat, the European Union’s largest budget item and also the most tangible expression for citizens of our achievements, so that 2009 is not a ‘blank’ year but a year of progress within the 2007-2013 programming period. I thank the Commissioner and her colleagues in advance for their proposals on this matter.

 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, the long and lively debates we have had on the European Globalisation Fund ring in my ears to this day. Our fellow Member Mrs Bachelot, with whom I worked on this fund along with Mr Cottigny, persuaded us to take some extremely important decisions. And what do we see today? Barely 4% of the aid budgeted for this European fund was distributed in 2007. You have already indicated, Commissioner, verbally and in writing, that you plan to revise the criteria. Is this revision of the criteria adequate to deal with the issues? No, it is not! When 96% of this aid is not being used, we really have to ask the basic question: is our aim in adopting this decision on the European globalisation fund appropriate? We face demographic challenges, as you said, and we face many economic challenges, given the reality of globalisation, of technology. I urge you Commissioner, on this Globalisation Fund, not only to revise the criteria but also to look at the very purpose of what we are doing here.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Reinhard Rack for his excellent report and I thank the Commission for having firstly drawn up the Green Paper, which is now the subject of a broad consultation and which is going to result in an action plan by the end of 2008. With my colleagues in the URBAN-Housing Intergroup, especially Jan Olbrycht, who has just spoken, we invited Commissioner Barrot to discuss this subject with us last year. That debate was particularly lively, notably on the topic of the integrated approach. Commissioner, in the brief time I have available, I would like to highlight the benefits of looking at that very aspect in greater detail. There is a fundamental link between urban planning concepts and urban mobility. When I say ‘urban planning concepts’, I actually mean the absence of urban planning concepts. I will mention four elements to illustrate this. Firstly, it is clear that our urban areas are currently growing, whether they are small, large or medium-sized, with the appearance of commercial, industrial, housing and leisure sectors and zones. Every time new zones are developed, mobility develops. Need I remind you that our urban areas have grown by 11% in terms of their size, while their populations have grown by just 2.5%? That in 10 years, from 1990 to 2000, the expansion of urban areas was three times the size of Luxembourg? These figures demonstrate that every time an urban area grows, our journeys get longer, no matter where they take us. Finally, within these urban areas, in 10 years the number of daily trips in private cars increased by 70% and each individual trip increased by 20%. These figures, these examples, clearly show that without a successful integrated approach that takes into consideration the different urban parameters, even with more efficient, safer, more intelligent vehicles, even with faster, more comfortable public transport, we will not totally resolve the problem of urban mobility and we will not resolve the problem facing our fellow citizens, who will always be forced to make an increasing number of longer, costly and unpleasant trips. These urban planning concepts, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, must take account of urban transport not just in terms of the cities and towns, the urban territory, but also, as my colleague Mr Rack said, at a suburban level. There must be a degree of consistency for all of our citizens who work, relax, learn, etc. in this urban and suburban perimeter. However, the problem that arises, and this has just been mentioned, is how to enable the different administrative structures, the different districts and the other territories to coexist. That is why, Commissioner, we are asking you to give special consideration to the integrated approach in your future action plans.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by highlighting the excellent results that have been achieved through PEACE I and PEACE II, most particularly for the beneficiaries of those programmes in Ireland – in Northern Ireland – to whom both dignity and hope have now been restored. That said, I should like to make two particular points, Commissioner, on which I hope you can obtain genuinely successful outcomes. Firstly, as Ms de Brún has urged in her report, the British and Irish Governments really need to get behind the decisions taken by Parliament, the Commission and the Council, so that temporary and complementary arrangements can be put in place through their joint efforts. Secondly, Commissioner, as you are in charge of the task force, you will not be surprised if I urge you to ensure that we take an integrated approach, in the interests of consistency among the various agencies involved, consistency among the different programmes and funds, and consistency between different geographical areas. Last but not least, I hope that the Irish example will provide a valuable lesson for other countries throughout the world.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when our planet has become a little village – so easy is it to move from one side of the world to the other – we need to grasp what an opportunity these outermost regions represent for the European Union. As our rapporteur, Mrs Sudre, points out in various paragraphs of her report we possess tremendous assets in our outermost regions: in agriculture, fisheries, research, technology and tourism. With a total of 25 million km2
 we have the largest sea area in the world. As the report says, therefore, we need to build on these assets so that our outermost regions can play a successful role in our shared future. My second point concerns the particular situation of urban areas – I speak here as Chair of the Urban Intergroup and I see a number of my fellow members of the Intergroup here this evening – because it is in urban areas that the problem of unemployment is concentrated, unemployment at three times the mainland European level. Migration is also focused on urban areas and it is there, too, that population changes have the greatest impact. Commissioner, what you have here is an exceptional opportunity to impose an integrated approach, embracing not only the various European funds but also different policies and different government, regional and local projects. If that integrated approach is not developed, we shall not be able to be effective in the outermost regions or to make best use of the assets they possess. I thank you in advance, Commissioner, for using our European rules to ensure that the integrated approach will contribute to the success of all the measures that we put in place.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to join my colleagues in thanking and congratulating Mrs Harkin for having produced this report. The choice of rapporteur is not a random one, as Mrs Harkin has extensive experience in the area of volunteering, and it is therefore only natural that she tabled this report. We have, of course, approved heartily of her being given this report, which she has drafted in a true spirit of consensus, for, as you will have noticed, we have tabled only one amendment, with which she is in agreement. This demonstrates the quality of her report, and I feel that this deserves to be strongly emphasised. Commissioner Danuta Hübner, you have, to some extent, beaten us to the punch and given answers, right from the beginning of your speech, to questions raised in this report. I should like to thank you in advance, and it is most likely that several of the other speeches made by Members will enable you, later and over the next few days, to provide further answers from the Commission. I should like to emphasise, in addition to what has already been said and further to what has been written in the report, that if there are 100 million Europeans who dedicate themselves to helping some 500 million Europeans every day, it must not be forgotten that these 100 million Europeans who volunteer receive personal gain from so doing, not in the financial sense but in the sense of personal fulfilment. You all know, we all know, I am certain, of sports teams and cultural and social leaders without whom our non-governmental associations and organisations would not operate. It must be said that these people need this commitment for their personal development. In an ageing society, in a society where there is an increasing number of young retirees, we also need this individual work-life balance that is achieved through volunteering. Therefore, for economic reasons, but also with a view to the fulfilment of the human values shared by Europe’s citizens – more than 100 million of them – let us make efforts to promote voluntary work in our societies and hope that, in the years to come, there will be well in excess of 100 million European citizens engaged in voluntary activity. Thanks to Marian Harkin, thanks to the Commission, thanks also to the governments and the regional and local authorities that are ready, tomorrow, to show their support, through their actions, for the wishes expressed by the European Parliament.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to say, Commissioner, that as I listened to your reply to the two reports by our colleagues Mr Guellec and Mrs Kallenbach, I felt there would be no need for me to say anything at all, since it was so obvious you were showing you had fully understood us. This is an initial stage, and I am extremely pleased and wish to congratulate the House since these close-knit reports between you, your associates, our committee and our Parliament have produced such a level of cohesion between our points of view. Now, however, beyond this cohesion, we must move forward with implementation, for it is all well and good to achieve cohesion among ourselves, but this must produce some specific results. I feel this is possible by means of the Green Paper you are drawing up for the autumn, and here I would like to mention two items dear to my heart, which in my view are essential to implement the entire cohesion policy and the Leipzig Charter we desire so much. The two items are: firstly, the necessity, which you have already mentioned and which I wish to reiterate in the strongest terms, of showing how different EU policies must be made coherent at the level of urban and periurban areas. Yesterday evening we were discussing population. Yesterday afternoon we were discussing transport. Before that we were discussing social issues. All the Commission’s DGs are involved, all the various EP Committees are involved ... All this must be made coherent within the microterritory of a town and its surrounding area. I expect a position to emerge from the Green Paper. Second item. How could we, Parliament and the Commission, if we agree on all this, succeed if we do not have European citizens and governments on board? I have already told you, Commissioner, we must make a huge effort, and I know you are endeavouring to do so, in terms of communication, so that all our speeches, all our comments, all our hopes with regard to cohesion, emerge in words and phrases that will encourage governments to act and persuade and motivate our fellow citizens. These are the two main points, Commissioner, that I expect to see in the Green Paper. After listening to us, I trust you will help us find specific applications.

 Mr President, Commissioner, as Mr Ettl said, we are facing a great challenge. All our fellow citizens have now realised that the climate is a challenge. Few have realised that democracy is a challenge. However, having said that, where is the demographic problem in Europe located? In the towns, of course, since 80% of the population is concentrated in towns. What is the issue for citizens today living in towns, and for mayors, since I know other fellow Members, MEPs like me, are also the mayors or deputy mayors of their towns? Let me take two sets of examples. A set of economic examples on the one hand. Where towns either have to accommodate a large population or, as in certain towns in East Germany, watch many of their inhabitants leave, in the second instance this means unoccupied housing, unused roads, districts heated for no reason, empty schools and, in the first it means building a school for EUR 5 million, as I have just done in my town, or a new neighbourhood centre for EUR 7 million. These represent economic expenditure that has to be borne by the towns and by the towns’ taxpayers. However, this is not just an economic challenge, it is also a human one because, in these neighbourhoods, when you see people who are isolated, when the whole neighbourhood is ageing, when you cannot hear the happy shouts of children playing in the street any more, that is a human relations problem. There are jobs that nobody wants, as you know. You cannot find a plumber in some small towns. We do not have enough nurses any more in my town. We do not have enough home helps any more, so people have to wait. Instead of having two hours’ help per day, we only get one. This is a serious human problem. Commissioner, going beyond the report by my fellow Member, Mrs Castex, which I will be delighted to vote for tomorrow, I would ask you, in my capacity as chairman of the Urban Housing Intergroup, to put forward a proposal on towns for us, so a chart can be set up in the near future for each town that enables us better to understand and control the demographic situation in our towns in the medium and long term, so decisions can be taken on housing, transport, schools, etc.

Mr President, Commissioner, let me say how pleased I am to speak on this subject this evening, because when we considered this addition, tabled by Mr Olbrycht, I expressed my confidence in the report. In fact this subject was discussed in the French Parliament yesterday and – this is worth emphasising, because it does not happen very often – all the political groups were in favour of the creation of this EGTC, and there were many examples showing how, in the north and south of France, in the Alps, in Lorraine, there was reason to put the EGTC into operation very soon. As the Commissioner said, this was based in particular on the example of Lille, which last Monday signed an EGTC that will cover two million inhabitants in Belgium and France. Why did that raise such high hopes? It was because for three or four years our colleagues looked for legal possibilities without success. With the EGTC, they found a solution. We are now expecting that the 70 000 French people who work in Luxembourg every day, the 30 000 French people who work in Monaco and Italy, as well as in Spain and so on, will really be able to foster new forms of cooperation with the EGTC. My colleagues and I would like to see the Commissioner urge on the States that are lagging behind. Apart from the fact that they are subject to the requirements of the regulation, they can be told that some countries are already operating the system perfectly happily.

 Mr President, I am especially pleased, Commissioner, with the five objectives you have just defined, although as you mentioned afterwards, there will be concrete measures following the consultation, which ends in March. If you will allow me, Commissioner, I would like to repeat what the members of our Urban Housing Intergroup have pointed out: namely the need to adopt an integrated approach, not only for cities, but also, as you said earlier, for the suburbs. As part of this integrated approach, bearing in mind that the European Union invests regional funds – the ERDF, ESF and EAFRD, the latter involving both rural and suburban areas – it seems to us that you and your fellow Commissioners need to take these various aspects into account, so that the integrated approach can truly be implemented by cities and municipalities. Therefore, today I once again call for the integrated approach to be taken into account in this issue of urban transport.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, various figures have been quoted this evening, and in the report by Mr Foglietta. I would like to point out that behind these cold statistics there are, first and foremost, human tragedies. I was head of a psychiatric hospital for some years and many of our patients were alcohol-dependent. Paragraph 26 of the report states that we need to know the causes. We have not talked enough about that this evening. If we want to decide on the right action to be taken with young people, old people, men and women, we have to know the causes. I am therefore urging that, in any action that is taken, more research is done in each of the Member States and in the European Union as a whole to find out more about why these young people feel the need to drink to excess. Why, too, do old people, isolated at home, drink too much? Why do men drink at work? Until we have found out the real reasons for this over-consumption, we shall not be able to provide proper answers.

Madam President, like my fellow Member, Mrs Krehl, I congratulate you on your election and on your first sitting as President. Commissioner Potočnik, I should like to say to you that this report, which has been presented exceedingly well by our fellow Member, Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg, is first and foremost a cry from the heart. Next, it is a necessity for the European Union, as Mrs Krehl just said, and it is an appeal to the Commission. It is a cry from the heart because the development of poor regions is not just about the development of regions but about the taking account of the situations – tragic situations in some cases – of people who are unemployed or who have to move, etc. It is therefore a human cry from the heart. It is also a necessity – the report explains this well – where the development of the European Union is concerned. That being said, Commissioner, we need to go further, and please do not regard my remark as a criticism, but as an observation; you yourself made various observations, in six minutes or so, culminating in these words: ‘I await proposals from Parliament’. Well, in the report by our fellow Member, there are a number of proposals. What I would like to convey in these few seconds granted to me is that we need clarification from the Commission, today, on the following: who does what, when and how? Who? What is the European Union’s role? I believe that, until now, we have for the most part successfully laid down the conditions in terms of funding, regulations and so on. The report by our fellow Member contains some additional initiatives relating in particular to financial aspects, to technical assistance aspects, etc., with the aim of strengthening the pivotal role played by the Commission and of putting it in a stronger position to make proposals and to provide assistance. But then, nothing, or almost nothing, is said about the role played by the Member States. The fact is, if we want to help regions in difficulty, it is not enough to say ‘there are European funds’, it also requires the Member States to assume their responsibilities. At this level, the Commission cannot impose things, given the constraints of the subsidiarity principle. However, in the light of what has taken place in Ireland and in the south of Italy, etc., some observations and suggestions can be made. I must say that, yesterday, I myself actually hosted some mayors of very small local councils of disadvantaged regions, and it is down to them to build projects – they just need to be told how to do so. To conclude, Commissioner, what I personally expect, in addition to what is given in the report by our fellow Member, is that the Commission does as it should do and clearly indicates to us who does what, and how.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to leave no one in any doubt about the fact that my group will, as a matter of course, strongly support the Andria and Janowski reports. Commissioner, I was quite clear to start with that you had taken full account of our fellow Member’s, Mr Janowski’s, requests concerning innovation. I did not have the same feeling when listening to you. Allow me to speak my mind, given that we enjoy close relations and tell each other what we think. You replied on the subject of cities, but you did not really talk about housing. Housing – and our fellow Member, Mr Hutchinson, has just been talking in these terms – is, in Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, the second most important need of any human being. The need for food is immediately followed by the need for shelter. Housing is fundamental to the protection of every human being. Housing is therefore an issue in every country whenever there are local or national elections although, admittedly, it presents itself in very different forms. We have seen this in France with its homeless people, and we see it in every other country in which the many and varied factors include problems involving building, urban sprawl, financing and so on. Among the various factors to be taken into account, there is one that I should like to take a few seconds to highlight. It appears in the Andria report but has not, in my opinion, been sufficiently underlined, and that is the issue of financing. We see how the price of land has risen throughout the world, leading city dwellers to seek ever further afield for somewhere to live. In other words, they waste time every day travelling between home and work and devote a larger portion of their budget to travel costs. This means that, every day, they cause more atmospheric pollution and that, every day, the number of social problems is increased. What I am trying to say is that this issue of housing costs is of relevance to us. In view of this situation, Mr Andria’s report contains a request for a study to be carried out. Most members of our intergroup and of the Committee on Regional Development are not asking the European Commission or European Union to accept responsibilities for housing that are not properly theirs. What we are asking right away, Commissioner, is that, with the help of your services, we might have a clearer view of the responsibilities involved. What are the responsibilities of, respectively, regions, districts and Europe as a whole? Where do the housing organisations’ responsibilities lie? What are the responsibilities of the financial bodies and of all the other players involved? The study referred to is absolutely fundamental to our knowing who is to do what. Thanks to the studies you are carrying out and the work you are doing, we await some clarification in the course of the next few months, bearing in mind too that a variety of Commission services – environment, transport etc – have a parallel interest in these housing issues. Finally, and by way of drawing things to a close, you can be sure that, proud as we are today of having obtained the Andria report, I and my fellow Members of the intergroup and of the Committee on Regional Development have no intention of stopping there but, rather, are determined, with yourselves, to make much further progress with this issue of housing at European level. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, in my opinion, this report has an advantage and a disadvantage. It has an advantage in the sense that it will allow us, I very much hope, to gain a better insight into the consequences of future enlargements. It could have a disadvantage, if we considered only the negative aspects of these future enlargements, since our fellow Member has actually highlighted a number of disadvantages, which may, incidentally, be rather worrying, and I understand that. Commissioner, what I personally am requesting of you is that, when you respond to us – as I believe you will be sure to do – you focus on three points. You need to inform us of the financial consequences not only in terms of expenditure but also in terms of revenue, and also inform us of the other kinds of revenue from a human perspective, for example. You also need to tell us what other political prospects and consequences there are. Let us not bury our heads in the sand; the issue of Turkey has been raised. I am not in favour of integrating Turkey but I am in favour of our examining this issue very quickly, with lucidity and realism, and finding the right solutions in the interest of the EU and in the interest of Turkey and of all the people of Turkey. I would be grateful to you, Commissioner, if you would respond to us on these three points: revenue, expenditure and political development.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank Mr Schapira for drawing up this report, which should prepare the ground for a very positive advance in our development policies. To put it another way, with this text we shall be able, I am convinced, to actually become more effective. After all, what is the point of generous – often general – objectives and what is the point of having significant financial resources if one does not achieve effective and efficient results? Local authorities – and this is very well explained in Mr Schapira’s report – are the operational link which, on the ground, can provide real solutions to the problems of the citizens of these countries: problems with drinking water, health, education, public transport and social problems. Among these unfortunately numerous problems, it is above all health problems that should receive our closest attention. On the ground, it is local authorities that are best placed to find solutions. Do they have the means to provide the right solutions to these various problems? Rarely, because they do not have the financial resources, or the experience, or the means for putting these solutions into effect. Thanks to this text, we shall, I am sure, be able to provide the required financial resources and the appropriate intellectual engineering. In this respect, too, I hope that the good practice processes that we have put in place, at European level, with URBAN (Intergroup on Urban Issues and Housing), will genuinely be made available to all these local actors. In the face of this major issue, I also believe that the growing experience that we have acquired with regard to the structural funds, and especially in cities, will be a great advantage. Furthermore, may I say, as coordinator of my group in the Committee on Regional Development, and as chairman of the Intergroup on Urban Issues and Housing, that, while 80% of the EU population lives in cities, urban demographic growth is phenomenal in all these developing countries, and only local actors will really be able to provide the right solutions that are required at local level. These right solutions will be the result of a new form of governance: the mayors of these local authorities, in particular, will have to be both operational in terms of power – the application of their legal powers – and also operational in terms of acting as motivators for all those issues concerning waste-disposal, water, health, and so on. It is in this regard that the support that we shall be able to give them will enable them both to be operational by virtue of their legal powers and to fully assume their role as motivators. Commissioner, along with our fellow Members and the members of the European Commission, I would like the various DGs concerned to be fully involved in making a success of this operation. Our countries expect us to act on this issue. We have the means to grant their wishes. Tangible results must be equal to their expectations. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, for a few minutes now, each of us, in turn, has been repeating the fact that we do not want the forthcoming provisions to result in so many additional constraints and regulations. We want a commitment on the part of business leaders, we want them to be proactive, we want this proactive approach to be applied internationally, we want SMEs to commit themselves and, as the rapporteur said, above and beyond declarations, we want something concrete. As a company director myself for over thirty years, well, I want things to be able to materialise. With this in mind, I have a proposal for you, Commissioners. A system is already applied internationally by hundreds of thousands of businesses. This system coordinates the social responsibility of businesses via the ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 18001 standards, which ensure that business relationships with customers are better, that practices are totally environmentally-friendly and that hygiene, health and safety rules are complied with in full. Therefore, allow to me to suggest, Commissioners, the use of these three management standards with the aim of having businesses throughout our Europe genuinely assume their social responsibilities.

Mr President, Mr Špidla, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being present and, above all, thank you to Mrs Bachelot-Narquin who, as my fellow Member, Mr Cottigny, did such an excellent job of saying just now, has succeeded in uniting the ideas of various parties within Parliament: it is most certainly not the case that she lacks ideas, but the fact of supplementing them with the ideas of various parties has actually enriched the debate. I should like to thank you too, Mr Špidla, for the participation of the Commission which, acting on the Council's wishes, has proposed a text on which we have been able to work. I note that the Council is not very well represented this evening: without doubt, the low turnout is compensated for by the quality of the persons present. We have finally reached an agreement: that is the crucial point. Once again, if anyone should doubt Parliament’s ability to enrich the texts proposed to it by the Commission, well, this evening, we can prove it to them! I do not wish to go back over what Mrs Bachelot-Narquin ably summarised. However, I should like to highlight a point that I feel is crucial in terms of the positive aspect of the text submitted to us, which I have no doubt we will adopt tomorrow: it is the very proactive aspect that we are going to provide in the area of retraining, of reemployment, of the reemployment of employees who are going to be affected by these globalisation-related developments, at a time when they are going to lose their jobs. We have insisted in our various debates that, thanks to training schemes, business start-up assistance and skills appraisals, to mention just a few examples, workers can immediately benefit from this money with a view to finding a job. Over and above these congratulations, however, I should like to guard us against a great danger: the illusions created by the communication on this Fund. Mr Cottigny, who is clearly highly motivated by human kindness and by his desire to create a social Europe, etc., did a good job just now of outlining all the hopes presented to us. I would advise caution: we only have EUR 500 million and, even if we had more, is it up to the European Union to take the place of training bodies, of the State, of the regions, of the local councils and of all the contributors, of which there are many? Next, it is quite important to understand that this system only exists when, unfortunately, a business winds up and has to file for bankruptcy, has to stop its activities. The same goes for its suppliers, its various service providers. Last week in Brussels, under the chairmanship and on the initiative of Mr Špidla, a two-day forum was held on restructuring. Well, I should like to say at this point that the work done by the European Union on these restructuring arrangements is very important because it is precisely going to allow us to take a dynamic approach to preventing a number of negative effects and, therefore, factory closures. I believe that the message that we, and particularly you, Commissioner, together with our Commission bodies in general, should send out is that, on the one hand, there is a human desire to provide new resources through this Globalisation Fund, and that, on the other hand, Europe, using the bulk of this budget, is dedicated to adapting to the modernisation of our European Union so that our general economy, and therefore, in fact, our employees, are better able to dominate the world’s developments. I believe that this is the message that we must send out, so that we do not have the kind of communication that is simplified in the extreme and that penalises the entire European Union.

 Mr President, Commissioner, in the debate that we are having at present, it is important not to get everything mixed up and not to confuse all the various responsibilities. Acting, as we are, at European Union level, we must demonstrate the resources available to us at this level in order to contribute to the best possible solution to problems of this kind, whether in the metalworking industry or in other branches of activity. As you said, Commissioner, just now when you began to speak, there are two aspects. On the one hand, there are the companies and, if we want employment at EU level to be maintained over time, we need successful companies. On the other hand, there are the employees, who are in need of help. Through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and very soon, I hope, the European Monetary Fund (EMF), the European Union has the resources to help every worker individually with re-training, returning to work or starting his or her own business. This customised help provided by the European Union needs to be publicised by the media when you issue your communications so that our fellow Europeans might be fully aware of the action taken by the EU. What is more, it is crucial, as you have said, to be able to respond promptly. If a number of sectors of the automobile industry – at present, it is Volkswagen – need our funds, the important thing is to help the employees extremely swiftly so that the aid we offer is genuinely useful and enables them to find other jobs quickly.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if there is one area in which all Europeans expect effective Community responses, it is that of large-scale natural disasters. Everyone has seen how, whenever major disasters such as the tsunami occur, there is a quick response on the part not only of individual countries and NGOs but also of our fellow citizens who, through their gifts of money, clothes and time, are able to join forces and take action. However, we have also seen, when each of these disasters has occurred, that what was missing was proper organisation. We are indeed confronted by inadequate organisation. That is why, together with my group, I am in favour of implementing preventative actions and of putting in place the capacity to respond very quickly to the consequences of tragedies. In this connection, I should like to draw attention to the quality of the Barnier report, which states the problem well and proposes solutions that are constructive not only - my fellow Members have already emphasised this – in terms, as one would expect, of efficiency but also of subsidiarity. At this stage, I should like to point out where this report scores. Although no one questions the fact that it is for the various military organisations, fire services and other players of various kinds to exercise their responsibilities in full, it has to be acknowledged that only the European Union is in a position to ensure preventative and responsive coordination. Finally, I should like to emphasise that the European Union has thus had the opportunity to demonstrate at a global level that the word ‘solidarity’ is not devoid of meaning but may be translated as ‘practical action’. If, when disasters similar to those of the past occur – and there is, unfortunately, a danger of their doing so in 2007 – the European Union has a presence on the ground in order to offer a response to human suffering and to mitigate the material, technical and ecological disasters, it will be viewed by the world as a more unified and much more practical enterprise. For this reason too, it is important for the Presidency successfully to carry out this operation as early as at the beginning of 2007.

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, there is a time for words and there is a time for action. I think that quite a number of those who have spoken this afternoon, on various subjects, have demonstrated the absolute necessity for the European Commission to take action. We want more innovation, more security, more solidarity and more competitiveness, and I am disappointed to see that the text presented to us by the Commission includes just a few lines on what is certainly the main heading in the European Union's budget, given that the 2007-2013 financial perspective allocates EUR 308 billion to the Structural Funds. However, if we want to provide real answers for ourselves and for our fellow citizens, with the Member States and with the various players, we need to make good use of the tools provided by the financial measures included in the Structural Funds, amounting, as I said, to EUR 308 billion. What, therefore, is the issue for 2007? Are we going to use the billions at our disposal to give our fellow Europeans real answers in the context of the regulations we adopted in this very House in July, or, mired in administrative mazes and in many and varied problems, are we going to reach 31 December 2007 without having got much further forward? I and my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Development brought these matters up with Mrs Hübner; we are disappointed that the Commission's document before us today pays hardly any attention to how the Commission intends to set out to achieve its objectives. We want these objectives to take particular account of circumstances in the new Member States, which will receive funds but will also need to be in a position to use those funds wisely. We have made proposals, as Mrs Hübner knows, and we are now waiting for practical responses to help these countries to use this money properly. There is another point that I, as chairman of the Urban Housing Intergroup, must obviously not neglect: how can towns and cities act as a real driving force in a Europe that needs to be more competitive and more innovative? On this matter, too, we are waiting for further action from the Commission. Finally, on behalf of my colleague Mr Davies, who cannot be here because he is at another meeting, I would like to say to the Commissioners that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is partly satisfied with the proposals on the environment, but that, as in the case of the previous point on the Structural Funds, we expect practical implementation – we expect action. In conclusion, Commissioners, we have no complaints about your communication skills, but we now expect practical action.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I will join my fellow Members in thanking Mrs Krehl for the work she has done and in thanking you, Mrs Hübner, for the quality of the relations we have had with you and with all of your services throughout the months that have led us to tomorrow’s vote. No one will be surprised as to how my group votes because, of course, we shall adopt this text, and we shall do so for at least two reasons. Firstly, it takes account not only of the majority of the requests from our group, but also, I believe, of the requests from the majority of us. Secondly, this matter has gone on for far longer than was scheduled, and it is therefore important that we adopt this text. I should like to make four comments. Firstly, I should like to point out to you – as my fellow Members have already done on several occasions – that, in Article 1 of the text that was adopted on 18 August by the Council, the words ‘to act as an indicative framework for the Member States’ are written in black and white, Commissioner. I am aware that, as things currently stand, it is considered bad form to want to impose on the 25 Heads of State or Government directives that come from the Commission or Parliament. I should, however, like to stress that we would have liked to have found some slightly more binding elements in this text. As some of my fellow Members, such as Mrs Krehl, have said, we will make sure, at mid-term, that we formulate the points of view that will be needed to change the wayward paths that may have been taken. Second point: I must emphasise the motivation for these strategic guidelines. The contacts that I currently have refer me to a Brussels ‘technostructure’ and to a Parliament that decides on strategic guidelines. All of that is very complicated. People forget too quickly, far too quickly, that it is in fact thanks to these Structural Funds and to these guidelines that, in previous years – with Portugal, Spain and Ireland – we have achieved important results, and this for the benefit of human beings who experience unfavourable circumstances in disadvantaged regions. They forget that our commitment to solidarity, which is being expressed today in this cohesion policy, is designed to allow all the communities and each and every inhabitant of the disadvantaged regions to have access to the same benefits as people in the more well-off regions. I should like briefly to say how much I welcome the flexible approach announced at the very start of this text. It is an approach that, in taking account of the strengths and weaknesses of each region, should enable priority to be given to transport, to the environment and to energy, in particular. Finally, like our fellow Members from the intergroup, who have already highlighted this point, we welcome the fact that this text emphasises the importance of cities. Having been in Germany myself a few days ago, I am in a position to say – and my German fellow Members will correct me if I am wrong – that 90% of the German population live in towns or cities with more than 2 000 inhabitants. In the text submitted to us, the importance of cities is emphasised. What I should like to say is that, aside from the words, aside from the financial amounts that are going to be dedicated to the Cohesion Fund, there will be the means to use the fund. Commissioner, in your communication on cohesion policy and the cities, you have reserved a special place for the integrated approach. I should like to say, at this stage in the debate, that we must remain extremely vigilant and ensure, above all, that the implementation of the integrated approaches does not only affect the cities in the strictest sense of the word, but also the communities surrounding the cities. We were talking about this matter with my fellow Member, Mrs Bourzai, who is present in this House, at lunch. It is not just the city that counts, it is all of the land that surrounds it, within a radius of 10, 20, 50 or 100 km, in which people live together on a daily basis. If people are to live together harmoniously, the various topics concerning transport, society and education must be linked together effectively. I shall conclude by saying that the actors must also have good links with each other: actors at national, regional, local and other levels. Just as an orchestra, with its violins and its pianos, needs a conductor in order to play well, we will ensure that there is a good conductor for all of these arrangements, one who is capable of making a success of this Cohesion Fund.

 Mr President, Mrs Hübner, Mr Špidla, Mr Manninen, ladies and gentlemen, I can testify to the vigour and richness of the exchanges of the last few months and the last two years, which have resulted today in texts that my colleagues and I think and hope will in a moment be adopted by the European Parliament by a very large majority. I would like to stress that, throughout this debate, my group has given the greatest possible attention to the need for these texts to be effective. The different speeches that have just been made have made clear the various areas where they need to be just that. As Mrs Krehl has just indicated, the Structural Funds are a testimony of solidarity with the most disadvantaged regions, so that they can attain an average level of prosperity. As the examples of Ireland, Spain, Portugal and other countries have shown, the development of regions benefiting from the Structural Funds contributes to the development of the European Union as a whole, because of the investments that those regions are able to make. Today, Mrs Hübner, Mr Manninen, we are going to move on to the second phase. After the theoretical phase of drawing up the Structural Funds, we are entering the preparation phase. Allow me to list three conditions – at an educational level and in terms of providing spurs to action and, if I may say so, tempting incentives - that are necessary if this preparation phase is to succeed. At an educational level, Mrs Hübner, I know that, with your co-workers, you have already organised a number of conferences to raise awareness. We really must develop this communication strategy, and the document that you have just published takes this approach. We also have to make good practices very widely known. The Member States, the regions and the different actors which are in the process of preparing projects must really have a good knowledge of different practices in order to be able to prepare their projects properly. Secondly, let us learn how to handle the various incentives available to us. You know - and with good reason - that within the Structural Funds it is possible to have recourse to technical assistance funds. We have noted in the past that a portion of these funds was not used, or was used badly. From now until the end of 2006, and throughout 2007, the technical assistance funds must be used in order to prepare worthy projects. Thirdly, as we say in France, ‘fear of the policeman is the beginning of wisdom’. The various Member States, project organisers and regions, etc. need to be reminded that if they do not comply with the rules laid down in the regulations, then they will not be able to benefit from the Structural Funds. I regret of course that, as my fellow Members have pointed out, certain Member States have recently refused to recycle funds that cannot be used within the specified periods. Finally, and to conclude, I cannot but point out, as president of the intergroup, that the European Union has finally recognised the need to bring the Structural Funds into play at the level of towns and regions. Therein, and within the framework of the Lisbon agreement, lies the assurance of improved success in the years to come. Mrs Hübner, Mr Špidla, Mr Manninen, please be assured that, together with our fellow Members of the European Parliament, we shall help to make a success of the Structural Funds, without however relaxing our vigilance.

 Mr President, Commissioner, in six months, or in a year at most, we will have a reorganised wine market, and I would therefore like to examine our current topic in the light of the general developments that have taken place over the last few years and that will continue over the years to come. First of all, I would emphasise – and in this I am practically diametrically opposed to the previous speaker – that, when it comes to wine, the real decisions are made by the consumer. We are not forced to drink wine, and we are under no obligation to choose any particular type of wine: it is ultimately up to the consumer to decide. So, what has the consumer done over the past few years? We have witnessed a fall in the consumption of table wines and an increase in the consumption of quality wines. We have also seen a considerable increase in the number of consumers and, if you have read the press recently regarding the decisions and wishes of China, you will be aware that, within the next ten years, we will have millions of new wine drinkers in the world. In addition, we have seen, again at global level and particularly from the new vineyards in the New World, the appearance of new flavours that match the consumers' requirements. All of that has happened over the same period of just 20 years, whilst consumers in France have halved their consumption of wine. It is therefore clear that there have been many major developments regarding wine consumption. Europe needs to be well positioned in this global market. I think we are all agreed that we need to act to preserve the globally-acknowledged high quality of our major wines from Spain, Italy and France – and I myself come from Champagne – in order to protect both their quality and their brand image throughout the world. At the same time, however, European viticulture needs to adapt to the needs of consumers all over the world. That, ladies and gentlemen, is why, in view of the changing tastes of our consumers, and given the disappearance of certain consumers and the appearance of others, I think it is quite natural to have the option of using these oak chippings in the production of European wine, provided, of course, that this option is not an obligation, that it is exercised within the framework of our various regulations and, finally, that all Member States may impose restrictive conditions on their use. In conclusion, let us not forget that, on our continent, in our 25 Member States, several million jobs, perhaps five million, depend on the production of wine, and that the sector has a turnover of EUR 17 billion – almost exactly the same as the wheat sector and significantly greater than the sugar sector, which is four times smaller. For all of these reasons, we need to adapt to the demands of our consumers.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced here with some extremely sensitive issues. The various disasters that have taken place, the distress they cause - which we share with the victims insofar as we are able, as outsiders - and the discontent that is expressed show just how sensitive these issues are. Throughout our debates, we have listed what these various natural disasters might have consisted of: fires, cyclones, tidal waves, earthquakes, floods, health crises, terrorist attacks, droughts, shortages of drinking water, industrial and technological disasters, agricultural disasters and undoubtedly many more. That is a long list that affects our Union and that calls on it to shoulder its responsibilities. Yet, as we were able to recognise in our debates, those responsibilities are shouldered by a variety of partners. First and foremost, they are sometimes shouldered by those responsible for the disaster, or for a fire, for example. Yet they are also shouldered by insurance companies, which are obviously affected, by the Member States and by the various organisations. What is the European Union's role, what is its mission, in this general context? For, as my fellow Member, Mrs Madeira, just said, if we are responsible for solidarity, then we must shoulder that responsibility within the context of our powers. Yet, what are these powers, before, during and after these natural disasters? I think that, after having heard our fellow Member, Mr Galeote, draw up a fine list just now, there is a need, Commissioner, for total clarity regarding this responsibility of the Union, before, during and after disasters. With regard to prevention, as with regard to protection measures, I believe that we do in fact have a power to exercise and a role to play in the fields of research and coordination. As regards the retrospective measures, which draw on our Solidarity Fund, our fellow Member, Mr Berend, has done a very fine job, but much remains to be done because it will always be very difficult to find ideal solutions, given the variety of situations and funding. We have a huge amount of work facing us. What I am asking you to do, Commissioner, is to find a better solution and to ensure that the European Union responds very clearly in the wake of these disasters. Our fellow citizens need a European Union that is very clear in terms of the measures it takes.

Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I should like to take my turn in thanking Mr Böge and all of our fellow Members - Mr Mulder and the others - for their contribution. Just when we are on the subject of a crisis of confidence in the European institutions, their contribution has demonstrated the extent to which our institutions, and especially our Parliament – that goes without saying – have played their part to the full. The institutions have played their part to the full because, over and above the exemplary nature of those meetings, we are going to use this interinstitutional agreement to provide our fellow citizens with the practical resources needed to give full effect to Europe and to the powers it has in terms of development and solidarity. As a member of the Committee on Regional Development, I should like to emphasise one point. Throughout previous years, we have been able to observe, and we continue to observe, how much the Structural Funds have done for countries such as Ireland, Spain and Portugal, and how much these Funds have changed people's everyday lives within regions that were previously lagging behind and that, now, have aligned themselves with the average of our European regions. With the Structural Funds for the 2007-2013 period, we can achieve this same result insofar as the new Member States, in particular, will be able to use the Funds made available to them. Nevertheless, we know that there will be a delay, in spite of rules n+2 and n+3; I therefore urge the Council, together with the Committee on Regional Development and the European Commission, to declare, forthwith, that the resources that are not used in the context of the Structural Funds will not be redistributed in the Member States, but reallocated as part of a new agreement that will be concluded in the next few years, thanks to which the Funds will be used to achieve the objectives of our proactive policy on this matter.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, to begin with, to quote one of the phrases contained in the excellent report by our fellow Member, Mrs Krehl: ‘The European Parliament is confident that the Commission and the Council will take on board the suggestions of the European Parliament; this is necessary if it is to give its assent to the strategic guidelines.’ You have listened carefully, Commissioner, as I too listened carefully to you just now when you gave your introductory address. Although you mentioned the regions several times, the word ‘city’ appeared only once in your speech. That is why, three weeks ago at the plenary of the Committee of the Regions, Mr Haüpel, mayor of Vienna, replied ‘That is unfortunately to be feared’ to a journalist who had asked the following question: ‘The urban dimension has been integrated into the objectives in terms of convergence and competitiveness. Do you fear that, unless something more specific is stated, it will fall by the wayside?’ That is why the Strategic Guidelines for Cohesion are of crucial importance. Personally, I recommend adding a fourth priority to the Community’s strategic guidelines. This would be focused on cities and conurbations and on the role played by these. I am anxious to point out that by ‘cities’ our Committee on Regional Development means not only cities or urban areas but also, as Mrs Krehl’s report emphasises several times, any territory that includes a city centre, outlying urban areas and all the rural areas that depend on the city, as the city depends on them. All these territories indisputably constitute not only the places where 80% of our populations are concentrated but also places essential to the development of our Europe through the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives. Mrs Krehl’s report accords an important place to cities. The objective of my speech at this time is to point out, while regretting that the Presidency-in-Office is not represented, that the members of our committee or intergroup have on several occasions urged the Council to put pressure on the Member States with a view to their all taking account of the urban dimension on the grounds that it will not be possible to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives if the urban sectors do not play their full role within the framework of the cohesion policy. While regretting that the Council is not present, we anticipate your total commitment in this regard. The cohesion policy needs to be able fully to bear fruit as a result of the urban sectors participating fully in it.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion this report is pretty exemplary in many respects. I think the main reason for this is that the report we have before us sets out the problem well. Some of you, including the rapporteur himself, have pointed out that this is not a new problem – it has existed for millennia. I would just like to emphasise that these issues of adaptation – because restructuring is simply one aspect of the adaptation of businesses – are absolutely vital in order to be able to respond to the needs of the customer, which includes every one of us here. I am not going to repeat the various points made by the rapporteur when he presented the subject. What I would like to say, because I think he sets a very good example, is that he has made some very pragmatic proposals, which I would divide into six categories. This has been emphasised by several people. The first point is the need to take action as early as possible. Also, I would remind my fellow Members, if they need reminding, that we do not hear anything about the vast majority of incidences of restructuring, precisely because the decision is taken in advance. Secondly, we need the partners to be involved – the partners in the business, obviously, but also the regional and external partners. My final point, which has already been raised, is support for workers. Nevertheless, I would emphasise one very specific aspect, that of tailored support for employees, because general responses are not the only option. A tailored response really is needed. Each employee must be able to get an answer, through information, help looking for a new job, and so on. As for the companies themselves, we must, as you said, make a distinction between the fraudulent businesses – because there are some – and the most essential businesses, which need to be supported. Finally, there is support for disadvantaged regions. Mr Cottigny, I would like to thank you for the way you worked. As Mrs Bachelot said on behalf of her group, I would say, on behalf of my group, that there is a good chance, a very good chance, that we will support you. In conclusion, Commissioner, I obviously hope that the Commission will listen to Parliament's proposals, but I also hope that, beyond our European institutions, the various players – in the Member States, in the regions and in the chambers of commerce – and the various professional players will take note of the letter and the spirit of this report, so that restructuring is not a death sentence but rather an opportunity for these businesses and these workers to bounce back.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to see that, after the long hours of work devoted to the report by our fellow Member, Mr Hutchinson, we have reached, as my two fellow Members have just said, if not a full consensus, then at least an agreement on most of the elements. Coming back to the initial report and to the observation made, I believe that we must of course take into account what motivated Mr Hutchinson, namely the shock that a relocation represents for the employees and the region concerned, since any relocation of a large workforce is a genuinely traumatic experience, both for the employees and for the region. As the rapporteur also said, it is not acceptable that certain business executives should use blackmail. We must, however, note that, in a free economy, there are, within our very own regions – since relocations sometimes take place within our own countries – differences in wages and technical competitiveness that mean that a company might in fact be led to relocate some of its production plants, whether it is goods or services that they produce. Finally, let us not forget that, in accordance with the Single European Act of 1986, we have to facilitate the free circulation of goods, persons and services in our Member States. Before talking about relocation, we need to ask the following basic question: if a company that has to face up to competition and that has to provide a service to its customers does not relocate, then what does it do? I am not talking about crooks here. I am talking about a number of companies that have been faced with this decision. The fact is that a number of them have managed perfectly well by creating and developing their Research and Development service, by creating new markets and by managing to relocate part of their activities. To conclude, then, I should like to stress that, as Mrs Krehl said, it is important that our European Union does not use its funds improperly to support relocations. Rather, we must use the available funds to support the employees and the regions that run into difficulties when such relocations do take place.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am, of course, delighted at the very broad consensus uniting us around Mrs Vlasto's report this evening, and I am pleased to have heard Chancellor Schüssel and then Mr Barroso telling us this morning how interested they were in SMEs and assuring us that this subject would be brought up during the spring Council. I would like, for my part, to draw your attention to two points. We have just been talking about SMEs in abstract terms, as an administrative body, needing simplification, more money, a better environmental context, and so on. A small business is, in essence, its leader – I know there are some in this Chamber who have just spoken – and it is now nearly 31 years since I myself set up my first business. We therefore need to take these leaders into account if we are going to give them real answers, so that their small businesses can run properly. If you talked to all the heads of SMEs in Europe, they would tell you one thing – that there are not enough hours in the day – and, at this time of night, many of them are still hard at work. We must provide real answers, Commissioner. We must simplify, but in particular we must apply the principle of subsidiarity so that authorities, states and professional organisations can provide real support at local level. It is not up to the European Union to do all of that itself, but it must do it. My second point relates to our fellow citizens. As has already been said, we must increase awareness right from school age. I would therefore like to make a proposal. Just as there are music and football competitions at European level, why not institute a European 'open day' for small enterprises? Why not organise a European Good Practice Day? Those are just a few ideas on how we can communicate and show our fellow citizens how important our SMEs are.

Madam President, Commissioner, in the light of Mr Hatzidakis’s proposals, I would like, if I may be so bold, to use a well-known phrase that you may remember: ‘Fear not’. Fear not, Commissioner. Do you believe that, in these financially difficult times, there are governments with sufficient resources to distribute funds generously among all the regions? Do you believe that there are governments crazy enough to allocate money to the regions, in the knowledge that their investments will be frittered away over the next few years? Fear not, Commissioner. As you said just a moment ago, these sums make up less than 20% of State aid. Fear not, Commissioner. You personally stated just now, at the start of your speech, that strict controls would be put in place, and Mr Koterec, whom I congratulate on his high-quality work, stressed that there were indicators such as unemployment levels and so on. Rest assured, Commissioner, that, if the safety net is increased to 25%, the Member States will make good use of the indicators you have put in place, in the interests of Europe and of our fellow citizens.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I should first like to thank those in the Commission, Parliament and indeed the Council, with which I had some contact, who helped me draw up this own-initiative report. I hope that it will be adopted in due course. What has got into Parliament to make it address urban issues, which are certainly not enshrined in our treaties and which do not usually fall within our competence? I feel that, in order to gain a proper understanding of the situation as it stands, it is worth taking a quick look back. Over the past half-century, our institutions have focused a great deal on tackling crucial headline issues such as, initially, coal and steel, the common agricultural policy, the Single Act – one of the cornerstones of our European organisation, enabling people, capital, goods and services to move freely throughout our countries – and then, more recently, the single currency. While these landmark events were taking place, our European organisation adopted thousands of measures relating to the citizens’ daily lives. Yet, despite all of this, we have not seen any coherent development regarding the urban and suburban areas where 3 700 000 people, 80% of the population, live. I wish to stress the terms urban and suburban. That being said, several important decisions have been taken over the past 15 to 20 years. The first of these decisions – and, no doubt, a significant one too – was taken in 1988, when Article 10 of the European Regional Development Fund specified the need for urban pilot projects. Two years later, in 1990, two documents were published: a Green Paper on the urban environment and a report on urban areas in crisis. In 1993, Jacques Delors organised a European symposium on cities. As regards the URBAN programme, which is the subject under discussion, the first programme appeared in 1994, followed by a second in 2000. Lastly, the URBACT data exchange programme came into being in 2004. In other words, the last 15 years has seen a steady trickle of programmes and measures on urban issues being adopted. I should also point out that, at the same time, in recent years, there have been many conferences, colloquiums and other fora on the subject. In recent months, though, things have moved ahead altogether more quickly. On 30 November 2004 the Dutch Presidency held an informal Council in Rotterdam, which placed the accent on the urban dimension and adopted an outstanding text on the subject. I should also point out, in conjunction with my fellow members of the URBAN intergroup, that the URBAN-housing intergroup was set up in 2005. A large number of articles on urban policy have appeared in all the documents relating to the regional funds prepared by the Commission before 2004. In December, the British Presidency is set to host a meeting on sustainable communities in Bristol. We can see, therefore, that urban issues have come a long way. What is the question before us today? What we see in our urban and suburban areas is a certain amount of waste. One Member of this House, who is here today, pointed out to us the other day, for example, that, in Leipzig, 30% of refurbished housing remains unoccupied. Is that not a huge waste? Have we not seen – thanks mainly to our regional funds, but also to national funds and local budgets – the occasional school built here and there without accommodation being refurbished, or vice versa, accommodation refurbished without infrastructure such as public transport being renovated? The time has come to put an end to such waste. The time has come for us to adopt a much more coherent policy. My report, which has been the subject of lengthy debate, is not intended to set fresh objectives. We already have objectives. The purpose of this report is to equip us with the resources to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives in our towns and cities. What are those resources? I presume you have all read this own-initiative report. I should like to highlight some crucial points, such as the fact that our three institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which prepares and implements legislation – need an internal shake-up so as to enhance the effectiveness of their decisions on urban issues. We are witnessing a power struggle between the Member States, the regions, the cities and indeed the EU, and these authorities must now work together much more coherently in order greatly to improve their own effectiveness once and for all. We need to develop urban policy that is integrated in both spatial and thematic terms. I have spoken about this from the perspective of the negative picture I painted earlier. We cannot implement a measure unless it works in tandem with other measures. I shall conclude by emphasising good practice. I often say that the awareness and application of tried and tested good practice is often far more productive than a small allocation of funds. Urban policy does not fall under Parliament’s powers. Let us not be under any illusion; Parliament is not about to release further vast sums of money in the framework of the financial perspective to fund new urban perspectives. Everything hinges on whether we can improve our organisation and our effectiveness. This is the proposal that I put to you in the various provisions contained in my report.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am an MEP from the great Eastern France, a region that produces Burgundy, the wine of Alsace – Alsace, where we are today – and, of course, Champagne. I have a duty, as an MEP who is, indeed, from the Champagne region, to inform you of the following observations, since the essence of today’s debate is the start of the agreement you spoke of, Commissioner, and which you obviously wish to finalise. While we too wish for it to be finalised, it is for the reasons that I am going to expand on. There is an economic necessity underpinning all of this. The US market, as has been pointed out several times since it was mentioned earlier, is extremely important for Europeans. In this age of globalisation, however, I would like to focus my remarks on issues related to quality. At international level, UNESCO regularly acknowledges a number of our sites of interest and buildings among the world heritage sites. Well, European wines, particularly those produced around the Mediterranean, as was pointed out earlier, have established their pedigree throughout the centuries and millennia. In an age when, at every important moment, when a peace agreement is signed, when a family party is celebrated, etc., it is wine and, moreover, quality wine that is consumed, quality must be recognised. Yet, what has been taking place for some decades now? We have been witnessing the spread of plantations throughout the world – in Chile, in Australia, in New Zealand – and, above all, and this is what is fuelling the debate this morning, an explosion of ‘Canada Dry’. People are reproducing wines left, right and centre throughout the world, quoting denominations on the labels that allude to the vine and the region in which the wines were produced – Champagne, Bordeaux, Porto, etc. – and they are trying to make consumers believe that, in the bottle they are buying, they have a wine whose origin and quality matches what the labelling would suggest. Commissioner, this agreement that you are going to finalise in the weeks and months to come must prevent consumers throughout the world from feeling cheated and deceived. We live in an age where the volume of counterfeit products is multiplying; we can see this taking place in the case of clothing items, with Lacoste, in the case of watches, with Rolex, and also, unfortunately, in the case of medicines. It is quite normal, natural and necessary that consumers throughout the world should be certain that a bottle of wine bearing the words ‘wine of Alsace’, ‘Burgundy’ ‘Champagne’ or ‘Port’ does indeed contain the wine in question. The quality of our world heritage is at stake, as are the interests of all our European wine producers. Long live European wine!

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say to Mr Guellec and Mr Marques, both personally and on behalf of my colleagues in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, that it was a great pleasure to work on their reports, which, of course, are essentially acceptable to us. For my part, I would like to focus more particularly on one of the points raised in Mr Guellec’s report, but which also affects Mr Marques’s report, as Mr Guellec has examined the role of urban centres and the surrounding areas. For a number of years we have readily been talking – I myself represent a town, Rheims in Champagne – about the concept of catchment areas. Catchment areas are zones covering both a town, whether small, medium-sized or large, and all the surrounding rural areas up to 5, 10, 15, 20, or even, to take the French capital, Paris, as an example, up to 200 kilometres outside it, where a number of people travel every day between their homes and their workplaces. It was therefore vital, in order to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, for the European Union to fit the bulk of its assistance into the framework of harmonious, consistent territorial development. These catchment areas, in particular, must play a central role, which is currently not the case. I have mentioned travel; it is clear that, in all catchment areas, there are housing problems. Housing is more expensive in the town centre, and cheaper on the outskirts; people choose to live in the outskirts because it is quieter there, or because housing is cheaper. All of this results in problems with daily commuting. We are seeing depopulated villages just a few kilometres from our towns, while, in some neighbourhoods, there is appalling overcrowding. We are experiencing security problems, and I could go on. It is therefore perfectly natural that, in order to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, we need to ensure that there is real cohesion within these catchment areas, between the town centre, the suburbs, the immediate surroundings and the more remote areas. Can we overcome these problems without too much difficulty? The answer is obviously no, in view of the large number of players involved. These include housing associations, decision-makers in the employment sector, and, of course, political decision-makers operating at local, regional and national level. We are all aware of the difficulties involved in harmonising the positions of the various political organisations. In this regard, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the European Union currently has a central part to play, in providing a stimulus to create, over the years to come, true cohesion in all of these areas, and harmonious development within these catchment areas. Finally, Mr Marques, I have already mentioned the respect I have for your report, and the support that we give it. I hope that, in all of our outermost regions, whether in the areas surrounding small towns, larger towns or in any other areas, the EUR 1 100 000 000 that we obviously hope will be released will enable us to realise the harmonious development for which we all hope and pray.

Mr President, Commissioner, like my fellow Members, I want, first of all, in my own name and on behalf of my colleagues in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to congratulate and thank the rapporteurs who have done an excellent job. They have worked with characteristic determination, but it was their flexibility and ability to listen that made it possible to reach something of a general consensus. As coordinator of the ALDE Group, I should like to stress four points. Firstly, the general architecture of these Structural Funds is such that they are mutually complementary and consistent with one another, something which should be emphasised in the communication to our populations. These Structural Funds are not something abstract. They are Funds that help to improve the conditions of daily life for our fellow citizens. A specific communication in these terms should therefore be planned. On this first practical point, I should like to say something about solidarity, as a number of fellow Members have done. These are not just words. The European Union, on this specific issue, is not just all about fine words, it is about figures – and they are extremely eloquent ones, because around 80% of the Structural Funds, in accordance with the budgetary guidelines, will be devoted to the objective of convergence. You have said, Mr Michael, that the Structural Funds were currently the European Union's second largest item of expenditure after the common agricultural policy. In future years, they are likely to become the largest item of expenditure. As regards solidarity, I should like to stress that the 25 Member States have all decided together – and Parliament will confirm this – that we are going to devote over 80% of the funds from this leading item of Parliament’s budget to solidarity with the ten new Member States. This is tangible and concrete proof, in coin of the realm, of our solidarity with the new Member States, which have great need of it and which, I hope, will receive an allocation of considerably more that EUR 300 billion. Finally, to conclude on a note of hope – but a hope that will certainly be fulfilled – I have no doubt whatsoever that the success we have seen in Ireland, Spain and Portugal will be achieved in the ten new Member States that will benefit from these Funds. But beyond the Funds themselves, I should also, and above all, stress the use made of them. It is one thing to have a franc, euro, dollar or schilling. Actual use has to be made of this money. I do not have the time to develop this point further, but please allow me to emphasise, in relation to the potential of the Funds, the need to ensure that Member States are aware of all the opportunities we offer, and which are available, for guaranteeing that the Funds are used properly. To conclude, I should like to direct a remark to you in particular, Mr Michael, as representative of the Presidency, and say, once again quoting a figure that I believe speaks volumes, that if we do not reach agreement on the financial perspectives this autumn, in 2007 the ten new Member States will only receive some EUR 9 billion, whereas with a 2007-2013 policy, a policy of solidarity through the use of the Structural Funds, they will receive EUR 22 billion. These two figures perfectly illustrate the absolute need to implement these financial perspectives without delay.

Mr President, like many other Members, I should like to congratulate our honourable colleague Reimer Böge for the work that has been done and for his coordination of all this work. I also believe it is fair to say, Mr Böge, that many other Members of this House have shown responsibility and diligence in arriving at the two-thirds majority to which you referred before. I therefore invite you, ladies and gentlemen of the Council and the Commission, to listen very carefully to this appeal from our Parliament, because it contains positions that are judicious in two main respects. Firstly, they are financially judicious, because, as has been partially explained in the course of this debate, they reflect an entirely satisfactory compromise on both the expenditure and the revenue side. On the expenditure side, we have managed to make proposals with the potential to curb expenditure in a number of areas, while on the resources side, as a previous speaker indicated – I think it was a Council representative – there will be increases ranging from about 8 to 15% in the final analysis, depending on the items, if I recall the figure that was quoted a short time ago. These, I repeat, are financially judicious positions. Secondly, our positions are politically judicious too, on the one hand because the wishes expressed in this Financial Perspective are consistent with the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives and on the other hand because those of our fellow citizens who want to take the trouble to fathom out the content of this Financial Perspective will find in it, I believe, a manifestation of our will to enhance our regions while improving our ability to master the challenges of the future. This is why I am pleased with the positions adopted by Parliament on the Böge report and why I call on the Commission and the Council to take heed of it. In addition, it is my fervent wish that we should be listened to by the Council on 17 and 18 June and that our views receive a favourable hearing. It is absolutely essential that the Council’s conclusion on this matter should not be seen as a patched-up decision but rather as a giant step forward towards our vision of Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to emphasise the significance of this joint debate on SMEs and I sincerely hope that the SMEs will hear the strong signal that our Parliament wishes to send out to them. Our group gave an enthusiastic welcome to the draft Small Business Act that the Commission presented to us last June. It is true that, since 2000, initiatives have been taken on SMEs. These initiatives were appreciated but inadequate. Why do I say inadequate? Because, according to the people they affected, all too often they remained just good intentions. Today, then, we must go further. The Small Business Act gives us this chance because it is part of a truly proactive global approach. I wish to point out that the European Parliament has already scored a success, as it was following the oral question that we asked in December that the Competition Council unanimously adopted the action plan that Commissioner Figel’ mentioned just now. This obviously showed the governments’ strong political will and, today, I would like to welcome the excellent report by Mrs Herczog which extends this impetus in such a timely way. I would like also to express my thanks for the quality of the cooperation that we have received and the excellent work that, I must say, we have achieved in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Today we have only put forward two amendments in the plenary session. This shows how well we did our work. As for our group, with the amendments that we have put forward and that our rapporteur has been happy to accept, we have set about looking for a way of getting the Member States and Community bodies more deeply involved to guarantee that the planned measures really deliver added value to the SMEs. We have called for the principle of Think Small First to be a compulsory and integral part of all future legislation. We have insisted on the Community patent and also, of course, on the financial resources so that these resources can be accessed effectively and quickly.

 Mr President, Mr Jouyet, Mr Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, our group enthusiastically supports the draft Small Business Act presented to us by the Commission last June. It is true, since the year 2000, initiatives have been launched for small and medium-sized enterprises – Mrs Vlasto’s excellent work on the SME Charter comes to mind in particular – initiatives that have been welcomed but deemed insufficient, since all too often they remain no more than pious hopes. Today, we need to go further. The serious economic crisis being experienced in our countries, with particularly worrying consequences for SMEs, spurs us on where encouragement was needed. In this respect, the Small Business Act forms part of a new, determinedly pro-active approach. In a few weeks’ time, we will examine Mrs Herczog’s report on the Commission’s communication, but today, by submitting this oral question, we have chosen to call on the Council. Mr Jouyet, we have noted with interest the conclusions adopted yesterday by the Competitiveness Council and we would like to know whether the European Council of 11 and 12 December will indeed relay these conclusions and push for the general guiding principle ‘Think Small First’ to be transposed quickly into Member States’ legislation. We hope that the Council will proceed on the basis of the action plan that is attached to it, accompanied by practical measures. In this regard, and in the short time I have been allocated, I wish to emphasise three areas in which we need a strong lead. Firstly, systematic impact assessments and regular follow-up, monitored by the European Parliament, on the status of the Small Business Act in the Member States. Secondly, access to public contracts. The code of good conduct has no binding authority; together we need to be more imaginative, more inventive and to propose appropriate and practical measures that will genuinely open up these contracts to SMEs. Finally, access to funding, which in the current climate is more vital than ever. Your proposals are sound, Mr Jouyet, they should also incorporate support for the offer. There is no time to waste. Please assure us of the Council’s intentions.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Verheugen on having taken the initiative to create a high-level group, CARS 21, to examine the European automotive industry. In 2003 several Ministers for Industry, including myself, were in favour of this new method, which involves examining a given industrial sector in detail in order to find the appropriate solutions for it. You will recall that this method was successfully applied to the textiles sector, for example. It enables us to involve the stakeholders and to achieve an integrated approach. I have just one wish for the future: representation that gives greater consideration to the diversity of professions covered by the sector and even greater involvement of the European Parliament. That being said, I would like to mention three of the proposals put forward in the excellent report by Jorgo Chatzimarkakis. The first is the importance of stressing that the automotive sector is a source of jobs, competitiveness, growth and innovation and thus calling for greater investment in research and development, particularly in the areas of hydrogen motors, fuel cells or hybrids. The message is clear and research into vehicle technologies will certainly have to be one of the priorities of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology. Secondly, as regards the contribution of the automotive industry to the fight against global warming, the targets for the reduction of CO2 emissions are in line with the Davies report we adopted in October. We must give the industrial sectors time to prepare. As a result, I believe that it would not be wise to bring forward the 2015 deadline. Nonetheless, the fight against greenhouse gas emissions must also involve tax measures that act as an incentive for fleet renewal. Finally, I am pleased that our rapporteur calls for the creation of an internal market for custom and tuning parts and for greater efforts to combat the import of counterfeit spare parts. The safety of the citizens and the survival of thousands of European SMEs are at stake. In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to point out that it is essential to take into account the pressure on the European automotive industry and the ever-increasing competition. I would like to thank Mr Chatzimarkakis for his excellent collaboration with the shadow rapporteurs and congratulate him on having achieved this very dynamic result, which augurs well for this important sector of our economy.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot stress it enough, we are producing legislation at this moment on the postal service for almost 500 million European citizens. Consequently, we must do it with both economic will and wisdom and properly assess the impact that our decisions will have on a population that is so vast and geographically diverse. With economic will, because the principle of progressively opening up to competition all economic activities is not only inherent in the very notion of the internal market without internal borders, but it has been part of the founding Treaty of the European Union since 1957 and it is beneficial in many respects, as Christine de Veyrac has very rightly said. It is the duty and to the credit of the Commission to act in such a way that this fundamental principle is implemented without undue protectionism. With wisdom, however, because the first objective of the Union in the very terms of the Treaty, is the ever closer union among our peoples and not only of our States. To advance, Europe must be perceived by its peoples as a plus and not just another constraint, without any apparent justification in their eyes. I pay tribute to our rapporteur, Mr Ferber, for his careful attentiveness throughout this lengthy process, as well as to the draftsman, particularly of the opinion of our committee, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Hannes Swoboda. I should like the vote tomorrow to be in line with the recent European summit and to be exemplary in this respect. The future simplified treaty, decided upon unanimously by the Heads of State or Government, will, indeed, redefine competition as a means for the Union and not as an objective. It will make the protection of its citizens an objective for the Union. Therefore, it will recall the specificity of services of general economic interest giving pre-eminence to the general principle of free competition. This is an excellent roadmap, because in all the geographical areas of our countries, as has been said many times, guaranteeing the quality of the postal service is a particularly sensitive subject for peoples, because it affects their personal, economic and social daily lives. Even if things have to change, we must make the necessary transitions with moderation and conscience. As shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I think that the compromise proposed by Mr Ferber is balanced and I invite you, ladies and gentlemen, leaving aside dogmatisms, of whatever tendency, to support it with your vote.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the serious electricity blackout that occurred on 4 November, initially in Germany, demonstrated – if there were any need to demonstrate it – that energy security is definitely a European concern and that it is at European level that we must find solutions. It is to Europe that people are turning more and more to safeguard the balance between the supply of, and demand for, energy, which is increasingly subject to the volatility of suppliers and to the tensions resulting from the very unequal geographical distribution of resources. Therefore, the Commission done the right thing in presenting us with this Green Paper, which we are examining today thanks to the report by our fellow Member, Mrs Morgan. I congratulate her on her excellent work, and I am delighted that a broad consensus within the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy should have been reached on such an important and sensitive issue as this and, above all, that the powerful idea that the three objectives of security of supply, competitiveness and environmental sustainability are absolutely paramount objectives, should have been highlighted. The same goes for the need to diversify the energy mix with the aid of the three pillars of fossil fuels, nuclear power and renewable energy sources. Finally, many people recognise that, in the current state of research, the act of abandoning one of these pillars would cause problems and would compromise the achievement of the aforementioned objectives. I should like to acknowledge the significance of this debate, which encourages us to be bold. For the first time, we have been given the opportunity simultaneously to tackle the challenge of growth and the challenge of environmental protection, and this, in an increasingly worrying context due to the damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions. As Mr Turmes said just now, we have only one planet. I therefore particularly support the amendment which, taking account of serious environmental warning signs, proposes a global objective in terms of the percentage of non-carbon-generating energy sources. To conclude, I will simply add, that, after the crisis caused by the failure of the referendums in France and the Netherlands, European integration must show the citizens that it is effective. Energy policy gives us the opportunity to do that. Let us hope the political will is equal to the task.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it has taken the civilised world thousands of years to eradicate the slave trade, inhuman working conditions and female submission, not to mention the death penalty, even though these battles are still not over. The century that has just dawned must be the one in which this new form of slavery that is forced prostitution and that each year claims thousands of women and children as victims is banished from our societies. That is the message constituted by the oral questions submitted today by our Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. The European Parliament – I am pleased to point out – is in fact identified throughout Europe and much further afield as a tireless defender of the universal values of the human person and of human dignity. By voting overwhelmingly in favour of Mrs Prets’ report on 16 January, we have already sent a very powerful signal to which you were not averse, Mr Frattini, as confirmed – if confirmation were needed - by your remarks of a moment ago. Our oral questions today follow on from our vote in January and from our action of 8 March, and once again show our indignation. We are deeply shocked that preparations are being made for the forthcoming World Cup with a blind eye being turned not only to the construction, but also to the commercial promotion, of a place that some even dare to boast will be the largest brothel in the world. As you in fact said, Mr Frattini, it is unacceptable that international sporting competitions should have thus become outlets for forced and organised prostitution. Mr Frattini, however strong our protests may be, they are not enough, and you have understood that. We are grateful to you for having replied to the majority of the questions we put to you. With the World Cup taking place in Germany very soon, this is a pressing issue. All of the initiatives that you have just mentioned are excellent, but I would draw your attention to the fact that they need to be in place in good time. That is why close monitoring is needed. For its part, the European Parliament will do everything in its power to help achieve this.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Prets’ excellent report tackles an extremely pressing and highly topical issue. At the very moment, in fact, when our societies are legitimately yearning to preserve the memory of what constituted slavery in centuries gone by, so that such crimes might never again take place, can we tolerate the continuation and development, throughout the world, of a new and modern form of slavery – sexual slavery – which is viewed by the traffickers as a run-of-the-mill commercial activity? The response – and a unanimous one at that - of Mrs Prets and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality is ‘No’. It must be recognised today that in spite of media interest which, I might add, is only a recent development, people still have a poor grasp of the devastating physical and psychological effects of trafficking. It must be recognised that, up to now, the texts we have adopted with a view to combating, at European level, the criminals who increasingly turn to this activity have more often than not gone unheeded. I therefore welcome the fact that Mrs Prets is proposing a series of measures relating, at one and the same time, to prevention, awareness-raising and repression, which is the integrated approach Mr Frattini was talking about. For the first time, the ground has been prepared for a genuine common policy for combating this terrible modern-day scourge. Mrs Prets’ report is timely in avoiding the debate on what constitutes, on the one hand, trafficking and, on the other, prostitution. Due to the profound differences between our various sets of legislation, this debate would be liable to come to an abrupt end and to leave us powerless. I appreciate this approach, which is at aimed at effectiveness, but I also appreciate the fact that the taboo problem of demand has not, for all that, been sidestepped because, in the triangle formed by the actors in this tragedy – the traffickers, prostitutes and clients – it would be impossible, without being hypocritical, not to mention the clients’ responsibility in this affair. I therefore hope that the points raised are upheld. They underline our Parliament’s awareness of the problem and its desire to resolve every aspect of it, that is to say to banish sexual slavery from our society. I hope that the solid consensus demonstrated in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality is repeated in our plenary, and I am convinced that the commissioners concerned, particularly Mr Frattini – who said as much to us - will hear our message and be very keen to make this fight a priority.

Mr President, the problem is quite simply that we will not have the time. It is not practical to start a debate, today, in the very few hours that remain, on a subject that will only be concluded in 2012 or 2013. We discussed it in committee, during the meeting of 30 April. The opinion of all of my colleagues is that we should wait until the next parliamentary term to start to examine matters.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the request for application of the urgent procedure put before us this morning, in implementation of Rule 134 of the Rules of Procedure, was submitted to us by the Council last week and relates, as you said, to the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a multi-annual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean. The aim of this proposal is to implement the new recovery plan, as recommended for these areas by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas at its meeting last November. As the Council pointed out in its request for application of the urgent procedure, this regulation needs to come into force before the start of the main fishing season on 15 April, which means that the obligatory consultation of this Parliament needs to be carried out in this plenary session so as to pave the way for a political agreement within the Council in the coming weeks. In view of this, and of the fact that the European Union needs to meet its international commitments and to do its part in the crucial efforts to deal with the acute crisis in bluefin tuna stocks, the European Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries has unanimously approved this request for application of the urgent procedure. I therefore encourage you to confirm this approval in this morning’s vote.
 Philippe Morillon,  
Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament’s decision to accept the Council’s request for application of the urgent procedure for this matter was a unanimous one, both in the Committee on Fisheries last week and here in plenary this morning. We are, of course, all aware of the need for the European Union to honour the commitments made in Marrakesh last November by the competent international commission, the ICCAT. We need, specifically, to put into practice the recommendations that this organisation adopted in order to curb the persistent problem of overfishing of bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean and to confront the resultant serious risk to the future of the species and thus to the fishing industry itself. Two of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries, Mrs Fraga Estévez and Mr Romeva i Rueda, were in Marrakesh and will be talking about this during the debate. For my part, I would like to remind you that our committee attaches great importance to this matter, which brings into play the main aspects of the common fisheries policy: resource management, fleet management, respect for international, regional and bilateral agreements, technical measures and, above all, monitoring, to which I will return shortly. This defining issue is thus, in our view, a test of the credibility of the common fisheries policy. For this reason, there was obviously no question of the new recovery plan being implemented without consulting the European Parliament. I am therefore delighted that the Commission ultimately chose the only legally and politically acceptable route for implementing the ICCAT’s recommendations, namely, submitting a proposal for a regulation in due form on the basis of Article 37 of the Treaty. The transposition into Community law of commitments made by the Commission on behalf of the European Union in regional fisheries organisations is, after all, hardly an uncontroversial operation, and we must insist that it should always be carried out under the democratic eye of this institution. I am, essentially, very pleased with the various measures put forward as, although they are rather restrictive for our operators, they are in line with the challenges, and I would emphasise that the most important of these measures are, without doubt, those relating to monitoring, as it is certainly true that no recovery plan can be effective without monitoring. I am therefore grateful to you, Commissioner, for this proposal, and I hope that you will show just as much determination in actually implementing the plan, once it has been ratified by the Council, as you showed in reaching a satisfactory agreement within the ICCAT.

 Madam President, I congratulate our three rapporteurs for this quite remarkable summary that they have given of the current state of our common foreign and security policy. Mr Solano, you know better than anyone that Europe is expected to take its place on the world stage, as dictated by its economic and demographic power and its wealth of democratic and humanist values. It has to be said that despite the will shown regularly by over two-thirds of our fellow European citizens, as you said, some progress has been made over ten years, I will grant you that, but it has to be said also that this Europe still does not exist. If one were needed, Europe’s reticence with regard to resolving the new tragedy in the Middle East would be a recent example of this. There was, and there still is, a need for the presence in Gaza of a Europe that plays an active role, helping the population to survive and rebuild the country, and helping in the fight against arms smuggling, which has allowed this territory to be transformed into a base for the launching of rockets of all sizes. Despite the verbal outpourings in Sharm el-Sheikh and Jerusalem, nothing has yet been done in this respect. I would like to ask again a question already asked at the time of the Lebanese crisis: when can we expect, Mr Solano, the deployment of a European fleet in the Mediterranean like the one you have introduced to deal with piracy? We have the resources. Will we, one day, have the will?
 Philippe Morillon  (ALDE
).  
– (FR) 
Mr President, achieving a lasting calm in Gaza will be possible only if a multinational intervention force is deployed under UN control. For the first time, Israel seems resigned to this solution, which has been demanded time and time again by the Palestinians. I do not know when this force will be able to intervene; intervention will not be possible before an agreement has been reached between the parties to the conflict, but we all hope that this will be as soon as possible. I do know, however, that this mission will require those conducting it to be completely impartial. I believe that the European Union will therefore be in the best position to take action and – why not, Mr Pöttering? – to do so within the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean. It will be in the best position to take action since, rightly or wrongly, the Americans are considered to have sided with the Israelis, and the Arabs, with the Palestinians. Do you not think, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that we ought to prepare ourselves for this?

 Madam President, would the increase in acts of sea piracy not be a chance for the European Union to use the means to defend its values and interests, if necessary and wherever necessary? In any case, do not tell our fisherman, who had to take refuge in the port of Mahé in the Seychelles last week, or the crews of our merchant and cruise ships who are being threatened further and further by Somalia’s territorial waters, that it is none of Europe’s business! That would be to forget what European citizens expect of Europe: primarily safety, and particularly safety at sea. That is why, Commissioner, the Commission’s initiatives to implement a European policy of the sea and oceans were so widely welcomed. That is why I suspect, President-in-Office, that there is a large majority in this Parliament that will approve the measures you propose at the end of the consultation, which I understand is still going on. Today, people are saying it is not that easy, that it might be better to consult our allies throughout the world first and to think about legality as regards international law. What was done for the recent release of the hostages on the Ponant
 and the Carré d’as
 shows that we have the means for effective action, provided that the will is there. If only this will, President-in-Office, could be the subject of a broad consensus in the Council!

Mr President, I asked to speak when I heard Mrs Ibrisagic describe the crisis which occurred in the Balkans, in which, as you probably remember, I was involved. At the time, our former fellow Member Jean-François Deniau said, ‘Europe died at Sarajevo’, and I replied, ‘Europe did not die at Sarajevo because Europe does not exist’. Europe still does not exist, and I congratulate our fellow Member Mr von Wogau for battling, as he has done since becoming Chairman of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, to ensure that Europe fulfils the expectations expressed not only outside Europe, in every corner of the world, but also within Europe, where, as you know, 70% of our fellow citizens are calling on Europe to take its place on the international stage and prove worthy of its heritage.

Mr President, Commissioner, evidently we are now continuing the debate in which, after almost two hours this morning, we were able to make some progress on this subject. I should just like to refer back, briefly, to three points which I believe are essential. We fully understand your priorities when it comes to exceptional and temporary measures to be put in place to tackle the problems of our fishing fleets, which are major consumers of fuel oil. However, I must emphasise that this should not be at the expense of those who have been able to reduce their energy dependence by using fishing methods and equipment which are better suited to current requirements. This is an initial point which I believe, from a psychological viewpoint, needs to be emphasised. Secondly, you have proposed measures which will, of course, have immediate effects, but which will also extend over the medium and long term. These are measures for regulating the market, and they are very welcome, although unfortunately we cannot expect miracles in this area in the very short term. My third and final point is that all this will not prevent us from continuing the debate that we have been having with you since you took up your present position, on a reform of the common fisheries policy which will enable our fishermen to have a better idea of their capacity, so as to avoid the disruptions which occur when TACs and quotas have to be changed suddenly without warning and which, in terms of profitability, are obviously very damaging to the activities of our fishing industry.
 Philippe Morillon,

Madam President, I will allow Commissioner Borg some time to settle into his seat. This oral question was initiated at the unanimous request of those groups sitting on the committee that I have the honour of chairing, and I am pleased that it comes after this most excellent debate, which dealt with a number of general issues. Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, my father was born more than a century ago in a village near Saint-Malo, which in my youth I knew as a place full of life that was dependent essentially on agriculture and fishing. Today this village is dying from a cancer caused by the proliferation of dead cells that are the holiday homes and the gradual disappearance of all those activities that used to enable it to live for more than just the six summer weeks. This is not an isolated phenomenon but is something that can be seen happening along practically the entire coastline of Europe and as a result of this situation Commissioner Borg, to whom I pay tribute, has been moved to propose the Integrated Maritime Policy, which should enable us to restore, preserve and resurrect the communities that live around the coasts of Europe. If this decision has meant transforming DG FISH into DG MARE it does not necessarily mean that the European Union is determined to see an end to those resources that our fishermen have to continue to exploit in the seas and oceans. Why does the European Union only have two common policies, namely the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy? When you think about it the answer is simple: it is to enable our continent to continue to obtain sufficient quantities of food by working the soil and fishing the seas. It is therefore in these sectors where the impact of the massive increase in oil prices could well have catastrophic consequences, and of course this applies particularly to the fisheries industry. Already badly shaken by the reduction in resources this profession is today essentially threatened with extinction and this explains – though does not excuse – the violent manifestations of despair that some of its representatives have resorted to and continue to carry on in certain places. This is why I am delighted, Commissioner, that your Executive Committee has now proposed a number of measures designed to come to the immediate rescue of those industries that are most threatened, including authorising Member States to grant special temporary exemption from the rules that have been imposed for the implementation of the European Fisheries Fund in accordance with procedures that are to be discussed, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in Luxembourg on 24 June at the next Council of Ministers on agriculture and fisheries. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the European Union – and the planet in general – has to be able to continue using the seas and oceans to obtain the food resources it needs. There is no point in preserving and protecting the fish if there are no longer fishermen to catch them. In my opinion this obvious fact justifies the detailed proposals that will cover not just the short term but the medium and long term too, proposals that we are working on together, Commissioner, in the Committee on Fisheries, proposals that will be further elaborated to you by the rest of my colleagues and in the draft resolution that will be put to the vote tomorrow.

 Mr President, this request – some here in this House are bound to recall, Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council – relates to the fact that at the end of last year we had to renegotiate the practical arrangements for the implementation of this partnership agreement with the Republic of Mauritania. This renegotiation required close collaboration between the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, Louis Michel, and Commissioner Borg, and I applaud this. It resulted in the setting up of a Joint Committee, which has, in agreement with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, come up with an agreement that now satisfies both parties: the European Union and the Republic of Mauritania. That said, it is now a matter of being able to pay the emoluments due to the Republic of Mauritania from 1 August. In agreement with all the political groups, we are asking the Commission if the vote on this report could take place not during this part-session, but during the July part-session. This is simply to allow our appointed rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Estévez, to explain the exact terms of this report to us on the afternoon of Wednesday 25 June, so we can vote on it on the morning of Thursday 26 June, therefore making it possible to put it on the agenda of our next plenary in July. I think this should be satisfactory to all three partners and, of course, to the Republic of Mauritania.

 Madam President, nothing surprises me, and in particular nothing surprised me in the Commissioner’s communication. Commissioner, thank you for that very detailed exposé. I would simply like to recall here that the declared objective of the Council’s proposal for a regulation is to simplify and improve the procedures for managing fishing authorisations. It was a question of introducing general provisions applicable to all authorisation applications, as you yourself said, Commissioner. A single procedure for managing all fishing authorisations has been proposed. The sharing of responsibilities between the Commission and the Member States is defined. New eligibility criteria, penalties in the event of infringements and provisions regarding reporting are also proposed. Compliance with the international regulations laid down by the different agreements is strengthened by the introduction of measures requiring Member States to exclude vessels from fishing if they are found to be involved in a serious infringement or if they have been placed on a list for taking part in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Mrs Stihler had been designated for this report but because the majority of members of the Committee on Fisheries did not agree with her on two points she considered key, she preferred to remove her name from the report. It therefore falls to me to present this draft as Committee chairman. However, I would like, in passing, to thank her for her work and I will leave it to her, when she presents her amendments, to give us the reasons for her decision. Within the framework of the consultation procedure, in her report which is now mine, the Committee on Fisheries has proposed a number of amendments to the Council’s proposal for a regulation, and you gave an exhaustive list of these – not a list but the numbers, Commissioner. These were adopted by a large majority of 19 votes for, 5 against and 2 abstentions. I will only present the main ones here. Firstly, the regulation should not apply to overseas territories of EU Member States. Secondly, an infringement should not be considered to be serious unless it has been confirmed by a successful prosecution in accordance with the relevant national legislation. Thirdly, the IUU list should be understood to mean the list of fishing vessels identified in the framework of a RFMO or by the Commission under the Council Regulation establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing - that very important task, Commissioner, which you are personally rather keen on. Fourthly, the Commission shall not refuse to transmit applications to the authorising authority without having given the Member States the opportunity to submit their observations. Fifthly, the Commission may not refuse to pass on applications unless it comes to the Commission’s knowledge, on the basis of duly substantiated facts, that a Member State has not complied with its obligations under a particular agreement. Sixthly and finally, Community fishing vessels for which a fishing authorisation has been issued shall transmit to their competent national authority the data concerning their catches and fishing effort with a frequency appropriate to the agreement and fishery concerned. The transmission requirements shall be compatible with those contained in the e-logbook regulation. I will leave it to my colleagues to talk more about some of these amendments, because some of them are the authors.

 Madam President, I will probably not need all that time to say that this debate will have been worthwhile and that the fact that some of our colleagues have tabled amendments despite the nearly unanimous vote, made it possible. You will have realised, Commissioner, that there are two concerns on this matter. You replied in part to the first concern expressed, which is the maintenance of relative stability. That is the purpose of amendments 20 to 24 tabled by our colleagues. The second concern is the one expressed by Mrs Stihler, namely that with this revision of the regulation, there could be unreasonable exploitation of fish stocks, in particular the fish stocks of third countries. Some of my fellow Members here have echoed this and that is why they signed. I think I can say, regarding this, that there is nothing in the text of the report that will be voted on tomorrow that could give rise to this concern, but it is up to our fellow Members tomorrow to decide because I think, Madam President, that you are going to announce that this report will be put to the vote tomorrow.

 Mr President, today, as Mr Burke has just said, Staff Sergeant Polin was given military honours today after he was killed in Sudan during the laudable and extremely difficult EUFOR mission in Chad and the Central African Republic. Please allow me to join the homage to him by his comrades-in-arms in the presence of the most senior national and European authorities, especially our High Representative, Javier Solana, and our colleague Karl von Wogau. For years this House has relentlessly asked the EU to take up its responsibility to protect the victims of the bloody confrontations in Darfur and surrounding regions. It had thus deplored the constant political obstacles preventing deployment of an international force to this end. It also welcomed the adoption, as you pointed out, Commissioner, of UN Security Council Resolution 1778 for the deployment of a military operation in Chad and the Central African Republic as back-up to the UN mission, MINURCAT and a Chad police force. There is no point saying anything now about the host of difficulties encountered to implement the international force, which was scheduled for deployment in November 2007, finally commenced only at the end of January, and will not be completed until May this year as per the current schedule. Mr President-in-Office, you mentioned the extent to which action by rebel forces in N'Djamena had delayed the mission, but some mention must also be made of the lack of means at the disposal of the European Union to deal with this kind of mission, particularly concerning logistics and helicopters. Here I welcome the announcement yesterday that Russia intends to provide the EU with essential means to assist troops on the ground on this kind of terrain. Perhaps, Mr President-in-Office, you could shed some additional light on this news?

Madam President, I should also like to say how much I approve of the approach suggested by our rapporteur to remedy the rightly criticised waste of resources in the current practice with discards. Whilst drawing up his report, Mr Schlyter has been conscious of the effects that the immediate implementation of a total ban on discards might have, first of all, on the fragile financial equilibrium of those working in the sector and, secondly, on monitoring of its implementation by the Member States and the Commission, obliging them to tighten up methods of supervision that do not conform to the budgetary rigour required of them. For that reason, he thought it more appropriate to propose the gradual introduction of a series of measures to encourage the fishermen themselves to alter their fishing methods and equipment, an approach strongly approved of by the Commission.

 Madam President, I am also going to add my congratulations to Commissioner Borg for the work done. He concluded with ‘believe and trust’ and it immediately made me think of ‘believe and dare’, which was a lovely motto at one time. Believe and dare! You have dared. I think the vision you have now developed particularly clearly in the communication before us is obviously a step in the right direction. I would like to ask one question which has been a particular feature of the concerns – and there are some – of the fisheries sector in this matter. The implementation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management will of course draw some of its credits from the European Fisheries Fund. The concern is that this European Fund, about whose inadequacy we have already had much cause for complaint, is the only fund used. I would like the Commissioner to reassure us on this point and confirm that the Structural Funds, of course the funds necessary for the development and protection of the environment, will also be contributing to the implementation of this policy.

Madam President, our fellow Members, Mr Bonsignore and Mrs Napoletano, have just made the point that, at the end of this week, the representatives of the coastal populations of both shores of the Mediterranean will meet again in this forum – happily now a parliamentary assembly – where they have endeavoured, since its founding, to develop relationships of trust, of which you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, have rightly stressed the importance. This will be our first meeting in plenary since the Lebanese tragedy, in which Europe, in my view, remained silent for too long and in which it finally intervened in a disorganised manner, on the initiative of this or that Member State. However, we know full well that it was the Union itself, as the heir to the humanist and cultural values that we know and bolstered by its economic power and demographic dimension, that was expected to play an intervention role at first, and a mediation role thereafter. Back then, the time had perhaps still not come to make the Union’s voice heard; it is perhaps a better time to do so now. Mr Solana, our high representative, was in Beirut the day before yesterday. He was received yesterday by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia; today, he is due to meet with the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad. I hope that these moves will help strengthen the hope born out of the recent diplomatic initiatives, which would seem at last to bode well for a calming of the situation. A calming of the situation in Lebanon, after the meeting between the prime minister and the head of parliament; a calming of the situation in Palestine, after the agreement reached in Mecca between Fatah and Hamas; and the first signs of calm throughout the Middle East after the first international conference in Baghdad, last Saturday. It is under these auspices that we must continue to develop parliamentary diplomacy in Tunis. Such diplomacy will, I hope, enable us to bring together our Israeli and Palestinian colleagues who, since our last plenary session, a year ago, have barely had the invaluable opportunity to meet and exchange opinions with the aim of conquering this disease of mutual fear, which their two peoples have had to suffer so much.

Mr President, it is almost 15 years to the day since I arrived in Sarajevo on the eve of the tragedy that was to make that town the martyred capital that we despaired for a moment would not survive. I arrived in a Sarajevo that was a model of coexistence between three cultures: Croatian, Serbian and Muslim. That town in which the bells of the Catholic cathedral rang in chorus with those of the Orthodox churches and with the cry of the muezzin, that extremely diverse town, without any ghettos, whose Serbian, Croatian and Muslim residents lived together in the same neighbourhoods and the same buildings, without even knowing who was Serbian, who was Croatian or who was Muslim. On 4 April 1992, I witnessed, in that town, the desperate attempt by an entire population, men and women, young and old, Serbian, Croatian and Muslim, marching through the town, to bring down the barricades that the supporters of ethnic cleansing had begun to erect. I saw those barricades give way one by one before the crowd, at the end of the demonstration, you may recall, were taken to task by Karadzic’s mad militiamen. I appreciate that town, that province, that republic for having recognised their assets and, above all, for having shared their suffering born out of the disease of a fear of others, of a fear of being wiped out and of a fear of losing their identity, so many fears that irresponsible criminals sparked there. With this memory in mind, I cannot overstate my satisfaction with the report by our fellow Member, Mrs Pack, whose commitment Parliament recognises and to whom it pays tribute for the dedication with which she has always worked to bring about a reconciliation in that country which, as she points out in her report, was once peaceful and multi-ethnic. In that country that we should encourage along the road to European integration by pushing it to adopt constitutional changes that are, as you said, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, vital, in spite of the persistence, within one section of its political class, of radical discourse that is still overly imbued with ultra-nationalism.

Mr President, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon will be strengthened, and the European Union will play an important part in it. We are right to be pleased about this. We must also be aware that, in order to be useful in such a difficult situation, the troops deployed will have to be respected, and, in order for that to happen, they will have to be strong, that is to say, they will need to have the resources appropriate to their mission and to have the right and the duty to implement them not only in the case of self-defence, that is to say, when their own soldiers are in danger, but also when the spirit or the letter of the mission may demand it. We learnt this lesson in the Balkans, with tragic effect. We must never forget it. Nor must we forget what all the peacemakers in Lebanon, as in the whole of the Middle East, are waiting for: it is not the UN, which has been present for too long and which has been rendered powerless for too long, it is not France on its own, it is not Italy, it is the European Union. You rightly said so, Mr Tuomioja. I bear witness, in this regard, to the effectiveness of the action that has been carried out for weeks in the Democratic Republic of Congo by the European force that was deployed there to support the UN’s action. Without its presence, I believe that I can say – as you know, Commissioner – that Kinshasa would now be torn apart. That is why I am calling on the Council and the Commission to check whether the European forces that are to be deployed in Lebanon could not be organised in a similar way, thus enabling the European Union to do what is expected of it, namely to exercise its own responsibility. Thus, if we are not merely indecisive, then why, for example, do we not immediately deploy a European fleet off the Lebanese coast? Euromarfor would give us the means to do this. No, Mr Cohn-Bendit, you are not a childish dreamer, and if you are, then I am even more of a child and more of a dreamer than you.

Mr President, as head of the European Union election observation mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, I have stayed in that country on many occasions, Commissioner, since the Commission entrusted me with the responsibility for the mission in October. An entire book could be written on the exceptional adventure embarked upon by the people of Congo in order to provide themselves with democratic institutions with the help of the international community and of the European Union, in particular. I shall confine my speech this evening to some comments about the new stage that was reached on this road on Sunday 30 July, during the first round of the presidential elections, which coincided with the legislative elections. Just after that first round, I had the satisfaction, on 1 August, of signing, together with my counterparts from throughout the world, from the African Union, from the French-speaking community and from the Carter Foundation, a joint declaration that was basically designed to point out how impressed we were – and I quote – with the strong turnout of Congolese male and female voters and with the participation of the political party witnesses and the national observers in the election of 30 July. In congratulating the people of Congo for the calm and dignified atmosphere in which these elections took place, we were urging the candidates – and I quote again – to respect the choices of the Congolese people and to use legal means of redress in the event of a dispute. Finally, we were calling on them to develop the peace process observed and to make a lasting contribution on the road to national reconciliation and to the rebuilding of the country. This appeal was sadly not heard by the most diehard supporters of the two candidates who were well ahead in the first round and, shortly before the provisional results were announced, on Sunday 20 August, they began to confront each other in the very heart of the capital, before reaching the stage, late in the afternoon on the Monday, of fighting with heavy weapons around the residence of the senior vice-president, in which the members of the international transitional aid committee, chaired by the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Bill Swing, were gathered. It was only thanks to the assistance of a security operation put in place by the general commanding the MONUC forces, with the support of the European-led forces of EUFOR, that the hostages were able to be set free and the madmen forced to return to their camp. I was therefore pleased to have championed in this Chamber the setting-up of that force and I felt proud – you are right, Commissioner – to be European, because it was the remarkably effective intervention of the European Union that enabled a swift return to calm. We should also once again congratulate the people of Kinshasa, who refused to let themselves be led into murdering and looting again, as they were being called on to do by the staunchest of those who remained opposed to any democratic revolution. The calm that has prevailed since then throughout the country may offer hope that those people will no longer cause any harm. It is up to us to demonstrate the greatest vigilance and to continue to use all of our political and, if need be, military, weight to put pressure on the two candidates that are still in contention until the second round of the presidential elections, scheduled for 29 October. Then, and in accordance with the Constitution, the power, Commissioner, will return to the people, by means of its elected parliament. That is what the people of Congo aspire to. That is what we must continue to help them achieve.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am actually speaking here on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, of which I am the chairman, to inform you that, yesterday evening, a large majority, 14 votes to 9, of the committee voted against the Council request for urgent procedure on the proposal tabled by our colleague Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna on the regulation on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco. This is because, were we to agree to this request, it would amount to signing a blank document regarding this agreement, at a time when the discussions within our committee are far from complete, as shown by the liveliness of yesterday's debates, and at a time when the Committee on Development, which has a particular interest in this type of agreement, has not yet issued its opinion. We are, of course, aware of the importance of this agreement both for the Moroccan Government and for European fishermen themselves. That is why we propose to deal with this matter under an accelerated procedure that will allow us, following further discussions at the next meeting of the committee on 18 and 19 April, to vote on the report in committee on 2 May, and thus to submit it to Parliament during the following plenary session in May. As far as we are aware, the initial payments should not be made until the end of June. We therefore do not think that this final period of reflection, which we consider to be necessary within Parliament, will cause any major difficulties.

Mr President, Mr Winkler, what is currently taking place in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with the support of the international community and, more specifically, of the European Union, is crucially important for the future of this vast country, which has been torn apart for years by civil and foreign wars. The Congolese people are today united in their profound desire for peace and stability and in their aspiration for a democracy that allows a situation of that kind. They demonstrated this by registering to vote in overwhelming numbers in July 2005 and they demonstrated this in December, during the referendum vote in favour of a draft constitution designed to put an end to the current transitional period. As head of the observation mission for this referendum, I attended the ceremonies marking the promulgation of the Constitution on 18 February, in Kinshasa, and I was able to assess the intense emotion of the participants and of the nation as a whole. A hope was born that at the end of the next stage, which will see a president and a parliament elected this summer, the country will succeed in finally emerging from the chaos and poverty in which it is still submerged. It is the interests of the Congolese people, the interests of the entire African continent and, therefore, the interests of Europe that are at stake. There is a danger, however, that those who have benefited up to now from this chaos and this poverty will not take kindly to being deprived of their power by the ballot boxes and that they may be tempted, on the one hand, to use terror tactics to prevent a lawful election and, on the other, to use force to challenge the election results. The security situation is being overseen by the UN forces, which are mainly deployed in the Eastern provinces in which organised gangs still operate. In these conditions, and in order to increase the security of forthcoming elections, the UN has sought the help of the European Union, as you mentioned. It will be up to the Council to determine what form this help will take. I am one of those who believe that this commitment will have the value of being a very powerful political signal to any potential troublemakers and that it will have what we anticipate to be a deterrent effect, and that is why I will be among those giving their support to this operation.

Mr President, Mr Winkler, the oral question to which we owe this evening’s debate, together with the proposals that will be submitted to our Parliament for tomorrow’s vote, are based on the observation that the only management measures to have applied to Mediterranean fisheries up to now date back to 1994. However, these measures are no longer suited to the resource situation or to the decisions taken on other EU shores. These decisions are aimed at implementing a common fisheries policy allowing the sustainable development of this sector of our economy and the preservation of the resources that the Union must, in order to provide enough food for its fellow citizens in the long-term, carry on being able to utilise by exploiting its own seas. Such a time-lag is due, first of all, to the fact that the Mediterranean is recognised as being one of the most diversified and most complex regions, as much from a biological point of view as from ecological, social and economic ones. That is why our Parliament had been unable to reach an agreement during the previous legislature and why Mr Lisi’s report had resulted in an admission of failure. That is also why this subject was put back on the working agenda of this new legislature as a priority and why it gave rise to a very delicate compromise at the conclusion of the work of our rapporteur, Mrs Carmen Fraga, to whose personal commitment I have a duty to pay tribute in this Chamber. This report was adopted – firstly in committee, and then in plenary – back in June. Its recommended measures have not, to date, been the subject of any implementing decision by the Council. We are aware of some of the reasons for this wait-and-see policy, but I personally had informed my colleagues about the measures in an attempt to push through a number of amendments aimed at preventing the ban on the use of certain types of nets traditionally used by fishermen in the region. This matter affected, and continues to affect, 75 boats that ensure the livelihood of 350 families and that generate 80% of the fishermen’s turnover when they use anchored nets, known as tenailles. 
The disadvantage of this type of fishing was that dolphins were being accidentally caught. That was until the profession finalised a programme permitting an 80% reduction in these accidental catches through the implementation of sound repellents and the systematic presence of observers on board the boats. If I am bringing this subject up again, it is because the socio-economic repercussions of the recommended measures certainly deserve more in-depth consideration. That is why I support, and why my group will support, the proposal for a resolution tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Article 4 of which demands that the fishermen affected by the new regulation and forced to change their fishing methods be properly compensated. During yesterday’s meeting of our committee, the European Commissioner responsible for Fisheries, Dr Joe Borg, was able to gauge just how incensed our Spanish friends had become at the prospect of a ban on the gillnets used for fishing in certain zones close to the Spanish coast. This ban would create an uncertain future for the fleet of 80 boats, which ensure the livelihood of 1 500 people. We have here a case altogether similar to that of the small-scale fisheries on the French coasts of the Mediterranean. That being said, Mr President, and while I can understand that certain decisions proposed by the Fraga report deserve to be discussed further and perhaps supplemented by an impact study, that would not justify indefinitely suspending the application of the entire content of a report that, as everyone agrees, is in itself a good compromise.

 Madam President, Commissioner, when, last month, I accompanied the delegation led by my fellow Member and friend Mr Salafranca, it was the fifth time in five years that I was returning to this territory, where I have not only visited the capital, but also travelled through most of the country, from the Panjshir valley in the north, to Kandahar, the capital of the Pashtun south, via Herat, Mazar-e Sharif and Bamiyan, the site of the giant Buddhas that fell victim in 2001 to the barbaric stupidity of the Taliban. On each occasion, I have been struck by the desire for peace and reconciliation felt by the vast majority of the population, a population that has had enough of violence after 30 years of civil war and international war, a population, moreover, that has been vaccinated against any risk of Islamic fundamentalists returning to power, following their suffering under the regime of Mullah Omar. At each new contact, I can also see how difficult the task of reconstruction still is and how necessary it therefore is for the European Union to continue to provide aid. I will only mention here one aspect of this aid, relating to the restoration of security, which is still too frequently under threat in some provinces. This aid is currently provided by the joint efforts of the national army of Afghanistan and international forces, which are themselves divided into two categories, with different mandates: the coalition, under US command, operating essentially around the border with Pakistan, and the ISAF which, as you said, has a large European majority and is gradually being deployed throughout the rest of the country. This duality is a source of inefficiency: I welcome the fact that NATO is now planning to bring the mission under a single command, under a new mandate from the United Nations. When it comes to discussing the terms for this, I would like, Commissioner, to act as an interpreter for the Afghan people themselves: they insist on the urgent need for protection from the interference of their neighbours in Pakistan and Iran, and believe that, once this is achieved, they will be able to solve their own problems between themselves.

 Mr President, with regard to the proposed reference to the Baker plan, you probably all know that it has disappeared from the new proposals by the United Nations Secretary-General.

 No, because we would then have to vote on Amendment 17, which itself relates essentially to the Baker plan. If Amendment 17 is not adopted, this will relate to Amendment 15 by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Fisheries’ proposal establishing measures for the recovery of the sole stocks in the Western Channel and the Bay of Biscay was submitted to Parliament under the consultation procedure. It is based on proposals submitted to the Council in December 2002 aimed at the conservation and sustainable exploitation, as you said, of fish stocks as part of the reforms to the common fisheries policy. The aim of this proposal is to ensure, in the two regions concerned and within a period of five to ten years, that these stocks are maintained within or rebuilt to safe biological limits. It comprises five chapters. The first chapter, specifying the criteria to be met in order to achieve the plan’s objectives, provided that, when stocks could be regarded as being within those limits, the Council could decide to cancel the plan at the proposal of the Commission. The other chapters specified the technical and inspection measures intended to allow this plan to be implemented. During the debates held on this subject, it has become clear that, as you have said, in at least one of the two regions concerned, the Bay of Biscay, the most recent scientific reports indicate that sole stocks are not below the biological safety threshold. Consequently, instead of adopting a recovery plan as referred to in Article 5 of the 2002 regulation, it seemed preferable to adopt a management plan as laid down in Article 6 of that regulation. This proposal obviously does not result in fishermen being free to recommence unchecked intensive fishing, which would certainly have a catastrophic effect on the future of the species. It has resulted in amendments to the technical provisions proposed by the Commission, but in such a way as, and I quote, ‘to ensure that these stocks remain within safe biological limits’, whilst at the same time stressing, and again I quote, that ‘the objective of the new common fisheries policy is to provide for the sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources, taking account of the environmental, social and economic aspects in a balanced manner’. I would point out that Parliament’s proposals specify in this regard that, where the Commission finds, on the basis of the annual evaluations, that any of the sole stocks concerned are at risk of collapse, it shall propose to the Commission additional measures to ensure recovery of the stock concerned. That summarises the main proposals in the report, which will shortly be put to the vote in Parliament with no amendments and which gained very wide support in committee, demonstrating a desire to involve the fishermen themselves in the considerations of the scientists and politicians and to reconcile the expertise of the latter with the experience of the former. I would like to add that the debates leading to the drafting of this report were conducted in an excellent atmosphere and I would like to conclude, Commissioner, by expressing to you my gratitude.

 Mr President, since our debate two weeks ago, there have been constant changes in the situation in Lebanon in reaction to the pressure – as everyone knows and has commented – brought to bear by a people who are almost entirely united, regardless of their origin or religion, and who are continuing to demand their freedom to live and their freedom of thought. After the resignation of the Karami government and the joint declarations by Presidents al-Assad and Lahoud on the withdrawal of Syrian troops, there were still tens of thousands of people demonstrating yesterday in Martyrs Square – now rechristened Freedom Square – to express their will and to keep up the full weight of pressure on political figures necessary if a genuine democratic process is to be set in train. I said that this people was almost entirely united. I used the word ‘almost’ because one note of discord was struck by the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, in his speech calling on his followers to demonstrate today, at this very moment, against the UN resolution, and to protest shamelessly against foreign interference and, I quote, ‘to continue resistance against Israel’. I found this latter part of his speech particularly disturbing because it expressed a desire, which I hope is a minority view, to oppose the very fragile resumption of peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine. Some of us here will be going to Cairo on Friday to take part in the plenary session of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. We are aware of the absolute need on that occasion to bolster the position of the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in his courageous desire to reject violence and, as a first step, to establish, in conjunction with Israel, a lasting ceasefire. If it became apparent that Hezbollah were firmly resolved to oppose this process, it would then be for you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to take appropriate action and to go so far – and why not – as to include this movement in the list of terrorist organisations. I hope that the Council will not need to go that far, as I would like to continue to believe that the enormous desire for peace will win the day.

 Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Mr President, Commissioner, the groundswell of solidarity provoked by the tsunami disaster on Boxing Day may have been even greater among the seafaring community, which is more aware than others of its consequences for populations most of whom lived from the sea’s resources. That is why, in response to this, Parliament, in its 13 January resolution, asked for an examination of the possibility of sending to the communities affected anything that might be of assistance to them, including boats. That is why Commissioner Borg and his services went to see things for themselves and are now asking us to approve the regulation authorising these potential transfers. As Mr Stevenson has just said, this announcement has stirred the feelings of some of my fellow Members, who are alarmed at the idea that Europe was in this way going to salve its conscience by simply sending its old vessels to people who would have no use for them and who would thereby be deprived of the resources essential for getting their economies going again. Obviously, that is not what the Commission intends, since it has sent the necessary experts to look at how to reconstruct the devastated countries in the medium and long term. Authorising the transfer of a few dozen vessels suitable for the needs of the local populations and therefore requested by their authorities is therefore a short-term measure, one for the next few months. As you know, these vessels will be less than 12m long and must be less than 20 years old. Before approving the Commission’s draft, as I hope we will, Parliament wanted, by means of a number of amendments, to clarify the terms for this transfer which, in particular, will not be made until the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has completed the study you mention, Commissioner. The FAO has the necessary expertise and authority and is responsible for coordinating aid from all over the world. The amendments also seek to introduce new recitals to make clear that this is obviously in addition to the funds granted for the reconstruction of the sector’s industries and infrastructures.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, while I fully agree with the text of the joint resolution which will shortly be put to the vote in this House, I would like to join you, Commissioner, in stressing two points about this text: one concerning the resumption of dialogue between the parties to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the other about the situation created in Lebanon by the assassination of Rafiq Hariri. So far as the new prospects opened up between Israel and Palestine are concerned, I want to repeat what I have already said many times in this House. If, as we all hope, a peace agreement is reached, the experience gained from decades of conflict resolution in such situations shows that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to do without the services of peacekeeping troops if the incidents that inevitably happen under such conditions, because local warlords are incapable of accepting peace, are not to degenerate into conflagration. I think a European force would be more likely than any other to be accepted by both sides for such a task. My question to the Council, Mr President-in-Office, is therefore: is it not time we prepared ourselves for that? Turning to the situation in Lebanon, as you have all reiterated, we and the international community have repeatedly called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from its territory. Has the time not come, Commissioner, for us to call on Syria finally to heed these calls before the association agreement on which negotiations have now been concluded is signed?

 Mr President, I beg your attention for a few seconds, because the wording of this oral amendment is different from the one on your voting lists. At the end of paragraph 9, after the words ‘asks for an immediate withdrawal of troops from the country as stated in the UNSC resolutions’, I propose that we should add the words ‘and will make that condition a crucial assessment criterion when the time comes to sign the Association Agreement’.

 Mr President, the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries will let you know how much we appreciate this request for urgent procedure. We have followed what Commissioner Borg has done since the tragedy took place and have supported him. On a practical level, we shall hold an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Fisheries at 5.30 p.m. in order to decide whether each measure, as Mr Swoboda said, is in the meeting’s best interests. In principle, however, and I believe that this reflects the opinion of most Members, I am entirely in favour of the urgent procedure.

 Commissioner, the debate that has just been held will have given you some indication of the keen interest my fellow Members and I have in the credibility of the common fisheries policy, whether this interest stems from a desire to strengthen it or, as in the case of a number of Members, to do quite the contrary, namely to challenge it. One of the arguments we hear put forward most frequently by those who challenge the need for a common fisheries policy relates to the volume of fish which the existing regulations encourage EU fishermen to discard, and which will not survive their capture anyway most of the time. As you are well aware, this problem has been a source of concern to our committee for many years, and has prompted your Commission, with our agreement, to arrange for several hundred studies to be carried out, with the aim of finding a solution if possible. It is also the reason behind my oral question to you, which I ask on behalf of the committee that I have the honour of chairing. As I stated in the question, by-catch is a global problem and remains one of the principal fisheries issues not to be addressed at present by an International Plan of Action by the FAO or by any other body. There is an urgent need to adopt an International Plan of Action on by-catch reduction, which could play a pivotal role in reducing by-catch internationally. A great many leading marine scientists and NGOs advocate the adoption of such a plan, and several member nations of the FAO have already committed to supporting such a proposal at the next meeting of the FAO Committee on Fisheries in March 2005. As yet, no nation has pledged to take a lead in proposing this initiative. Given that the European Union is a major fishing power, is the European Commission therefore committed to taking a lead in proposing an International Plan of Action on by-catch reduction? Does the Commission recognise that if an International Plan of Action is not put on the FAO agenda in 2005, it will be necessary to wait for the next session in 2007? I should like to thank the Commissioner for having agreed to be present to answer both this question and the other questions my fellow Members will ask.

 Mr President, following the election of Mahmoud Abbas and the formation of a new Israeli government said to be in favour of withdrawal, there is renewed hope that progress can at last be made in the peace process. It is a fragile hope, and the window of opportunity of which you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, spoke is a narrow one. I would like to see our trans-Atlantic relations strengthened by the resolute commitment that the European Union and the United States must make, that this opportunity be not lost. The new Palestinian president must indeed be strongly encouraged in his self-confessed willingness to renounce violence and thereby relaunch dialogue. This courageous stance will, however, become untenable unless he soon – that is to say, between now and the summer – gets distinct indications that this attitude is in no sense a sort of capitulation. We have always known that this conflict, so long and painful, would, at its end, have neither victor nor vanquished. Whether rightly or wrongly, the Arab world regards the Americans as having taken Israel’s side. That is why there are such expectations, and not only in Palestine, that the European Union will balance perspectives and give its own guarantee. Here more than elsewhere, and now more than ever, our expectation of you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is that this necessary complementarity of influences be reinforced and put to work for the sake of peace and in order to strengthen trans-Atlantic relations, which is indispensable.

 Mr President, Commissioner, during the past few months constant increases in the price of a barrel of oil have deepened the crisis affecting the European fisheries sector. These increases have a direct impact on wages for crews, as well as on companies’ profit and loss accounts. As you said, these companies can barely, if at all, pass the increase on to the selling price of fish, given the specific nature of this market. The previous crisis which occurred ten years ago had an avalanche effect, weakening management and financial structures in the sector and thus seriously jeopardising the economies of affected regions. The situation we are facing today is comparable in the economic and social distress it is causing. The governments of the Member States are endeavouring, or will endeavour, to confront this situation by taking measures which comply with Community regulations, as you said. These measures, however, can do nothing but maintain the current state of affairs, and they cannot claim to provide an effective and lasting solution to the economic problems caused by high fuel prices. The Community approach, which is focused almost exclusively on, and I quote, ‘the sustainable management of fisheries resources to preserve the interests of future generations’, is no longer credible as it stands, as there is a risk that it will result in a situation where the European Union is no longer able to exploit these resources due to a lack of workers experienced in the field. Under these conditions, how can we work towards the real goal of our common fisheries policy, which, as I see it, is for it to act in tandem with the common agricultural policy to maintain our continent’s capacity to produce sufficient food? Mr Almunia, my question is that which I prepared with my fellow members of the Committee on Fisheries; will the Commission undertake to act on behalf of the most seriously affected areas? For example, does it intend to put forward proposals to allow measures to be taken under the existing Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance, or under the future European Fisheries Fund, or under any other mechanism, to improve the economic situation and to thus preserve the future of regions which have no real alternative?
